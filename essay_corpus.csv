H,1,"The way the light shined on her skin as she sewed the quilt emphasized the details of every wrinkle, burn and cut. While she completed the overcast stitch, the thimble on her index finger protected her from the needle pokes. She wore rings on every finger of her right hand, but on her left she only wore her wedding ring. The rings drew the attention away from her age and scars to her cherished possessions. My grandmother’s rings had not only been stolen by her son, my father, but she was constantly in the state of fear that he would steal from her once again. When my father was incarcerated, she wore her rings every day of the week; however, when he was home, her hands were bare. As it became increasingly common over time, she learned to hide her treasures in a jewelry box under her bed. As a small child, I watched my grandmother’s hands move in an inward and outward motion, noticing her rhythm. This rhythm was like the cha-cha music I heard every Sunday when I went with her to the pulga, the flea market. Every week, she bargained on the vendor’s products and brought home “unnecessary necessities”; luckily, some weeks it just happened to be thread and new sewing outlines. As my grandma sewed my outfits for school, I was always trying to complete the outline of La Rosa de Guadalupe just so I could impress her. I would sing along to her favorite Prince Royce songs, use the same color of thread as her and try to go at the same cha-cha. With my father incarcerated, the women in my family went to work. At the age of 11, I started working for the very first time as a cleaning lady with my grandparents. Even though I wanted to help my family, I was ashamed to be a cleaning lady. I argued with my mother against living a life like that, a life in which I gave up my childhood for my family’s stability. After being called “malagradecida” — ungrateful — several times, my grandmother reacquainted me with the idea that “todas las cosas buenas vienen a los que esperan” — all good things come to those who wait. Sewing was no longer a hobby, but a necessity, when it came to making my own apron, seaming together rags and pushing for a better future for my family. My grandmother, too, had to put down her quilt and go to work, but she never complained. In recent years, my grandmother has become increasingly ill, so I took her unfinished quilt to my home, planning to complete it. My grandmother did not choose to leave this project unfinished; her age and constant contribution to her family through work did not allow her to. Often, obstacles have not only redesigned my course, but have changed my perspective and allowed for me to see greater and better things present within my life. The progression of each patch depicts the instability present within my family. However, when you put all these patches together as one, you have a quilt with several seams and reinforcements keeping it together to depict the obstacles we have faced and have overcome to show resilience. Now, when she visits our home, as she reaches for her glasses and pushes her walker away from the table, my grandmother asks me to bring her the quilt. The jeweled hands that were once accustomed to constant stitching are now bare, and the scars are hidden under every wrinkle. With a strong grip on the quilt, my grandmother signals me to get her sewing basket that sits in the corner collecting dust. She runs her hands over the patches one last time and finds an unfinished seam. She smiles and says, “Cerrar la costura y hacer una colcha de su propio” — close the seam and make a quilt of your own.",1,2.890860422,3.049834107,3.208276136,3.368252956,3.127793221,17.6,21.2,23.8,27.0,22.0
C0,2,"As I sit across from my grandfather, his wrinkled hands holding onto his cane, I can't help but think about how much he has influenced my life. Growing up, my grandfather was my hero. He was a World War II veteran, a master gardener, and an all-around handyman. He was always the first person I turned to for advice, and he never failed to offer his wisdom and guidance. However, as I got older, I started to realize that there was much more to my grandfather than just his impressive resume. I began to see him as a person, not just as a figure in my life. I learned about his struggles and his triumphs, his fears and his hopes. And through it all, I came to understand that he was more than just a grandfather - he was a symbol of resilience and perseverance. My grandfather grew up during the Great Depression, and his childhood was anything but easy. His family was poor, and they struggled to make ends meet. Despite the hardships, my grandfather was determined to succeed. He worked odd jobs to help support his family, and he excelled in school. When World War II broke out, he was one of the first to enlist. During the war, my grandfather served in the Pacific theater. He saw things that no one should ever have to see, and he endured unimaginable hardships. Yet, he never lost his sense of purpose or his determination to make a difference. When he returned home from the war, he settled down and started a family. He worked hard to provide for his loved ones, and he never complained about the challenges he faced. As I reflect on my grandfather's life, I realize that his story is not unique. There are millions of people like him - people who have faced adversity and overcome it through hard work and perseverance. Yet, what sets my grandfather apart is his unwavering commitment to doing what is right, even in the face of adversity. One of the most impactful memories I have of my grandfather is from when I was in elementary school. I had gotten into a fight with another student, and I was sent to the principal's office. When my grandfather found out what had happened, he didn't scold me or lecture me. Instead, he took me aside and told me a story. He told me about a time when he was in the army, and he was stationed in Japan. One day, he saw a group of children playing soccer in the street. He stopped to watch them, and he was struck by how happy they seemed, despite the fact that they had so little. He decided to join in their game, and before he knew it, he was laughing and playing with the children. For a few brief moments, he forgot about the war and all of the horrors that he had seen. As he told me this story, my grandfather's eyes lit up with the same joy and wonder that he must have felt that day in Japan. He told me that life is too short to hold grudges or to dwell on the negative. He encouraged me to be kind to others, even when they are not kind to me, and to always look for the good in people. Those words have stuck with me throughout my life. Whenever I face a difficult situation or encounter someone who is unkind, I think back to my grandfather's story and remind myself to be kind and compassionate. My grandfather may have passed away several years ago, but his legacy lives on in me and in the lessons he taught me. In conclusion, my grandfather was more than just a grandfather - he was a symbol of resilience, perseverance, and kindness. He taught me that no matter how difficult life may seem, there is always a way forward, as long as you have the courage to keep moving forward.",0,2.532041973,2.693091452,2.821700831,3.045506403,2.764361713,13.4,15.0,19.0,22.0,17.0
C1,3,"The sun was setting on a warm summer evening as I sat on the porch with my grandfather. He had just finished telling me about his experiences in the army during the Vietnam War, and I was in awe of his bravery and resilience. As he finished his story, he leaned back in his rocking chair and looked out at the fields beyond our house. I had always admired my grandfather. He had a quiet strength about him, and a deep sense of empathy that extended to everyone he met. He was the kind of person who would give you the shirt off his back if you needed it, and he always had a kind word for anyone who needed it. As I sat there with him, I realized that my grandfather was getting older. His hair had turned white and his face was lined with wrinkles, but his eyes still sparkled with the same mischievous twinkle I remembered from my childhood. I wanted to do something to honor him and to show him how much I appreciated everything he had done for me. That's when I decided to write him a letter. In the letter, I told him how much he meant to me, and how much I admired him for all of his hard work and sacrifice. I thanked him for being a role model and a constant source of support and encouragement. When I gave him the letter, he read it slowly, his eyes moistening with tears. He looked up at me and said, 'I didn't know you felt that way. You make me proud, and I'm glad I could be a part of your life. My grandfather passed away a few years ago, but I still think about him every day. He taught me so much about what it means to be a good person, and he showed me that even the smallest acts of kindness can make a big difference. I'm grateful for every moment I spent with him, and I'm glad I had the chance to tell him how much he meant to me. In many ways, my grandfather's legacy lives on in me. I try to embody the same qualities of empathy and kindness that he showed to me and to so many others. I try to be a source of support and encouragement for those around me, just like he was for me. As I think about the future, I know that there will be challenges and obstacles ahead. But I also know that my grandfather's example will guide me and give me strength. I hope to honor his memory by living a life that reflects his values, and by passing those values on to others. In the end, I think that's what my grandfather would have wanted most of all. He wasn't looking for fame or fortune, but for a life well-lived, filled with love and compassion. He wanted to make a difference in the world, even if it was just in the lives of those around him. And he did. So as I sit on the porch now, looking out at the fields beyond our house, I can almost hear his voice whispering in my ear, reminding me to be kind, to be strong, and to never give up. And I know that as long as I carry his memory with me, I will never truly be alone.",0,2.444907898,2.571810088,2.711096361,2.874256781,2.67931216,14.8,16.0,20.4,25.2,18.5
C2,4,"The sun peeked through the windows, casting a golden light on the cluttered living room. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mixed with the musty smell of old books as my grandfather, a small, frail man with a twinkle in his eye, beckoned me over to his rocking chair. As I approached, I noticed his hands, with their delicate, spidery fingers, cradling an old, leather-bound book. His hands were full of wrinkles and creases, but they moved with grace and precision. As he opened the book, the scent of aged parchment and ink filled my nostrils. He turned the yellowed pages with care, each crackle of the pages an audible whisper that seemed to tell a thousand stories. As he read to me, I was captivated by the way his eyes danced across the page, the way his voice rose and fell with each new character. My grandfather's love for literature was infectious, and it wasn't long before I was hooked. We spent hours discussing the nuances of various authors, the hidden meanings behind their words, and the way their stories spoke to us on a deeper level. He encouraged me to explore my own creativity, to find my own voice and to express myself through writing. I began writing my own stories, and my grandfather was always there to offer support and guidance. He helped me hone my craft, teaching me the importance of symbolism, metaphors, and other literary devices. I spent many hours writing in the cozy, cluttered living room, surrounded by the books that my grandfather cherished so much. But our time together was not always spent in quiet contemplation. My grandfather loved to dance, and he would often take me out to the backyard, where we would twirl and spin to the sound of his old records. He was surprisingly light on his feet, his movements graceful and effortless, and I always felt like I was floating on air when we danced. His love of dance extended to his cooking as well. He was a master in the kitchen, and he would spend hours preparing elaborate feasts for our family. I can still remember the sound of sizzling onions, the savory aroma of fresh herbs, and the way his hands moved with the same grace and precision he displayed when he turned the pages of his beloved books. My grandfather's passion for literature, dance, and cooking has left a lasting impression on me. His love of creativity inspired me to pursue my own passions and to find my own voice. He taught me to appreciate the beauty in the world around me, to find joy in the small moments, and to never take a single day for granted. Now, as I sit in my own cluttered living room, surrounded by books and memories of my grandfather, I am grateful for the time we spent together. He showed me the power of creativity, the joy of dance, and the magic of a well-prepared meal. His legacy lives on in the stories I write, the music I dance to, and the meals I prepare for my own family. My grandfather's hands may have been small and frail, but they were filled with a strength and grace that I can only hope to emulate. And when I hold a book in my own hands, feel the music in my heart, or taste a perfectly cooked meal, I am reminded of the lessons he taught me and the love he shared with me.",0,2.864104177,2.967877574,3.049814407,3.251371554,3.02793533,15.0,17.4,22.6,27.8,19.0
H,5,"“Nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes'. Not only do Benjamin Franklin’s words still resonate today, but, if you are like most, filing income taxes is simply unpleasant. For me, however, preparing taxes has been a telescopic lens with which to observe the disparate economic realities present in our society. In looking through this lens, I have seen firsthand how low wages and, at times, regressive public policy can adversely impact the financially fragile, and how I can make a difference. This coming year will be my third volunteering every Saturday during tax season with AARP’s Tax-Aide Program. In the basement of the Morningside Heights Library in Manhattan, we help the elderly and low-income individuals file their taxes. During my first season, I handled organizational tasks and assisted intake counselors with the initial interview process. When I told the AARP manager that I wanted to return the following season and do actual tax preparation, she was skeptical, especially since the next youngest tax preparer at my location was 37. That, however, did not deter me: Though I would be just 16 before the start of the season, I diligently studied the material and passed the advanced I.R.S. qualification test. As a volunteer, my goal is to help my clients obtain every credit they are entitled to and place vitally needed money in their pockets. To do this, I need much more than just technical knowledge. It is also essential to connect on a human level. I make it a point to put each person at ease by actively listening to his or her story. For example, the young woman, who is a recently minted United States citizen and barely speaks English, mentions that her disabled grandmother lives with her. Her story allows me to determine she can claim a dependent care credit for her grandmother and a $1,000 earned income credit. These credits represent approximately 20 percent of her income and will go toward buying her grandmother’s medications and other necessities. I am saddened at times by the palpable stress of those living on the edge of economic subsistence. Basic necessities such as sneakers and dental care, which I had never thought twice about, are out of reach for many. I vividly remember the single mom from Queens who works at Target and spent $400 (a week’s paycheck) at H&R Block last year. By not having to pay for tax preparation this year and the credits she can claim, she confided she will be able to buy her son, who is my age, new shoes for track and hopefully see a dentist for a tooth that has been throbbing for months. As a volunteer, I have learned the importance of empathizing, listening and communicating complex and technical matters simply. Making my clients feel at ease allows them to understand my explanation of how their money is being taxed. I have also gained insight into how tax policy affects the financial and physical health of the working poor and elderly. While I have not changed the tax system (though someday I plan to), I have changed how my clients interact with it. Beyond Benjamin Franklin’s two certainties in life of death and taxes, I would add a third: the enduring power of the human spirit. I remember an octogenarian man with a cane who waited two hours in line on a bone-chillingly rainy Saturday in February. He is somehow able to survive in Manhattan on $15,000 of Social Security earnings a year. Even though his income is below the filing requirement, together we claim $77 of school tax and rent credits, which translates into two weeks of groceries. When we finish, he says to me, “See you next year'. It is at that moment I know I have made a tangible difference.",1,2.617354969,3.063957808,3.397143821,3.516223576,3.218407696,16.0,19.0,21.0,25.0,21.0
C0,6,"As a high school senior, I never expected that I would spend my weekends working as a tax aide. Yet, after a chance encounter with an elderly neighbor struggling with her taxes, I found myself spending my Saturdays and Sundays helping members of my community file their returns. While the work itself might seem mundane, I found that the experience was surprisingly enriching. For me, working as a tax aide was not just about helping people with their finances – it was an opportunity to connect with members of my community, learn about their lives, and gain a new perspective on the challenges that people face. One of the things that surprised me most about my experience as a tax aide was the diversity of the people I met. While I expected to work primarily with seniors and retirees, I was surprised to find that my clients came from all walks of life. I helped single parents struggling to make ends meet, recent immigrants navigating the complex tax system, and college students filing their first returns. Each person had their own unique story, and I found myself learning as much from them as they did from me. One client in particular stands out in my memory. She was a woman in her early thirties, a single mother with two young children. She had recently lost her job and was struggling to make ends meet. As we worked through her tax return, I could see the anxiety and stress etched on her face. But as we talked, I learned more about her life and her struggles. She had grown up in poverty, dropped out of high school to support her family, and had fought tooth and nail to provide a better life for her children. Despite the setbacks she had faced, she remained determined and hopeful for the future. As I helped her navigate the complicated tax system, I realized how much I had taken my own privileges for granted. I had never worried about where my next meal was coming from, or whether I would be able to pay rent. I had always assumed that college was a given for me, rather than a luxury. But working with people like this client, I saw firsthand how much harder life can be for those who don't have the same opportunities. Through my work as a tax aide, I also gained a new appreciation for the value of hard work. Many of my clients worked multiple jobs or long hours to provide for their families. They didn't have the luxury of taking their time to file their taxes or hire expensive accountants. Instead, they relied on people like me – volunteers who were willing to give up their weekends to help out. In many ways, I saw working as a tax aide as a form of community service. It was a way for me to use my own skills and knowledge to help others, and to give back to the community that had given so much to me. It was also a way for me to challenge my own assumptions about the world, and to gain a new perspective on the challenges that people face. As I prepare to leave high school and embark on the next phase of my life, I know that the lessons I learned from working as a tax aide will stay with me. They have taught me the value of hard work, the importance of empathy and compassion, and the power of community service. And while I don't know where life will take me next, I know that I will carry these lessons with me wherever I go. In many ways, working as a tax aide was a unique experience – one that I never expected to have, but that I am grateful for nonetheless. It showed me that even the most mundane-seeming tasks can hold unexpected value, and that by giving of ourselves to others, we can learn as much as we teach. I may not know what the future holds, but I know that the lessons I learned from working as a tax aide will stay.",0,2.671989304,2.763241196,2.889837472,3.036199718,2.817793635,15.0,19.4,23.0,27.0,21.0
C1,7,"As a student interested in economics, taxation has always been a topic that piqued my curiosity. I’ve always wondered about the rationale behind taxation and how it impacts individuals and society as a whole. It wasn’t until I started working part-time at a small accounting firm that I truly appreciated the complexities of taxation and its impact on people’s lives. I vividly remember the first time I assisted a client with their taxes. Mr. Smith, a retired veteran, had recently lost his wife and was struggling to cope with the added financial burden of being a single-income household. As I went through his tax documents, I couldn't help but notice the various deductions and credits that he qualified for but had not claimed in previous years. With a little bit of research and guidance, I was able to help him maximize his tax refund, providing him with some much-needed financial relief. This experience made me realize the importance of taxation and its potential to alleviate financial hardships. However, it also made me aware of the inequalities and complexities within the tax system. I realized that not everyone has access to the resources and knowledge required to navigate the tax system effectively. This realization sparked my interest in tax policy and reform, and I began to delve deeper into the topic. Through my research, I discovered that tax policies have a significant impact on income distribution and wealth inequality. I was shocked to learn that the top 1% of earners in the United States pay a lower effective tax rate than the bottom 50%. This realization motivated me to explore the various tax reform proposals that aim to address this issue. One proposal that particularly intrigued me was the idea of a progressive consumption tax. Unlike the current income tax system, a progressive consumption tax would tax individuals based on their spending rather than their income. This type of tax system would be more equitable, as it would tax individuals based on their ability to consume rather than their ability to earn. To better understand the impact of a progressive consumption tax, I decided to conduct a case study on a hypothetical family of four. I compared the tax burden of this family under the current income tax system to that of a progressive consumption tax. Through my analysis, I discovered that the family would pay less in taxes under the progressive consumption tax system, even with a higher consumption rate. This finding strengthened my belief that tax reform is crucial in promoting income equality and reducing wealth disparities. My interest in tax policy and reform has also led me to participate in various community service projects. For example, I volunteered with a local organization that provides tax assistance to low-income families. Through this experience, I saw firsthand how tax policies can impact vulnerable populations and how essential it is to ensure that everyone has access to resources that can help them navigate the tax system. Overall, my experiences with taxation have taught me that it is more than just a source of revenue for the government. Taxation can impact people's lives in significant ways and has the potential to promote social and economic equity. My interest in tax policy and reform has driven me to pursue a degree in economics and has shaped my long-term career aspirations. I hope to one day work in the field of tax policy and use my knowledge and expertise to promote a fairer and more equitable tax system. In conclusion, my experiences with taxation have not only taught me the complexities of the tax system but have also ignited my interest in tax policy and reform. I believe that taxation has the potential to promote social and economic equity, but it is crucial to ensure that everyone has access to the resources necessary to navigate the system effectively. As I continue to explore the topic, I hope to use my knowledge and expertise to contribute to the ongoing conversation surrounding tax policy and reform",0,2.963496368,3.192923875,3.262795584,3.356437389,3.232139579,17.0,19.0,23.0,26.0,21.0
C2,8,"As a child, I never thought much about taxes. It was just another adult responsibility that didn't concern me. But as I grew older, I began to realize the impact that taxation had on my life and the lives of those around me. One vivid memory I have of taxes was when my family and I visited a small town in the mountains for a weekend getaway. As we drove through the winding roads, I noticed the deteriorating infrastructure of the town. Cracks on the roads, rusty bridges, and abandoned buildings were a common sight. When we arrived at our hotel, I saw the chipped paint and worn out furniture. Despite the breathtaking natural scenery, the town lacked the charm and liveliness that I expected. It was then that my parents explained to me the concept of taxes and how they are used to fund public goods and services. They told me how the lack of investment in the town's infrastructure was a direct result of inadequate tax revenue. That conversation sparked my interest in taxation, and I began to learn more about its impact on society. As I dug deeper, I discovered that taxation was not just a means of collecting revenue but also a tool for shaping society. Taxes can be used to incentivize certain behaviors, such as tax credits for renewable energy or deductions for charitable donations. They can also be used to discourage negative behaviors, such as sin taxes on tobacco and alcohol. One example that particularly stood out to me was the carbon tax. I learned that a carbon tax is a tax on the use of fossil fuels based on their carbon content. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. As someone who is passionate about environmental sustainability, I was fascinated by the concept of using taxes to address a global issue. In addition to the policy implications, taxation also has personal implications. I experienced this firsthand when I got my first job as a teenager. I remember receiving my first paycheck and seeing the amount of money deducted for taxes. It was frustrating at first, but my parents explained to me the importance of paying my fair share and contributing to the community. That lesson stuck with me, and I have since come to appreciate the role that taxes play in funding public goods and services. As I continued to explore the topic of taxation, I realized that it was not just a matter of policy and personal responsibility but also a matter of ethics. Taxes are a reflection of our values as a society, and they can reveal disparities in wealth and opportunity. The wealthy often pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than the middle and lower classes, and this has led to calls for tax reform and greater equality. I believe that taxes are a necessary and valuable aspect of our society, but they should also be fair and just. We need to have an open and honest conversation about how our tax dollars are spent and who is benefiting from them. We need to ensure that taxes are not just a burden on the working class but also a means of creating a better society for all. In conclusion, my journey of discovery about taxation has taught me the importance of this complex topic. From funding public goods and services to shaping societal behaviors and reflecting our values, taxation has far-reaching implications. As I move forward in my education and career, I hope to continue learning about taxation and finding ways to improve our tax system for the benefit of all.",0,2.737660739,2.887507098,2.985922358,3.099683076,2.939658724,13.4,17.4,20.6,23.8,19.5
H,9,"I always assumed my father wished I had been born a boy. Now, please don’t assume that my father is some rampant rural sexist. The fact is, when you live in an area and have a career where success is largely determined by your ability to provide and maintain nearly insurmountable feats of physical labor, you typically prefer a person with a bigger frame. When I was younger, I liked green tractors better than red tractors because that was what my father drove, and I preferred black and white cows over brown ones because those were the kind he raised. I wore coveralls in the winter and wore holes in my mud boots in weeks. With my still fragile masculinity, I crossed my arms over my chest when I talked to new people, and I filled my toy box exclusively with miniature farm implements. In third grade, I cut my hair very short, and my father smiled and rubbed my head. I never strove to roll smoother pie crusts or iron exquisitely stiff collars. Instead, I idolized my father’s patient hands. On a cow’s neck, trying to find the right vein to stick a needle in. In the strength of the grip it took to hold down an injured heifer. In the finesse with which they habitually spun the steering wheel as he backed up to the livestock trailer. And I grew to do those things myself. When on my 10th birthday I received my first show cow, a rite of passage in the Hess family, I named her Missy. As I spoke to her in an unnaturally low voice, I failed to realize one thing: Missy did not care that I was a girl. She did not think I was acting especially boyish or notice when I adamantly refused to wear pink clothing (she was colorblind anyway). And she did not blink an eyelash at her new caretaker’s slightly smaller frame. All she cared about was her balanced daily feed of cottonseed and ground corn and that she got an extra pat on the head. As I sat next to her polishing her white leather show halter, she appreciated my meticulous diligence and not my sex. When Missy and I won Best of Show a few months later, my father’s heart nearly exploded. I learned to stick my chest out whenever I felt proud. While I then associated my conquests with “being a better boy,” I now realize what I was really working toward was becoming a better farmer. I learned I could do everything my father could do, and in some tasks, such as the taxing chore of feeding newborn calves or the herculean task of halter-breaking a heifer, I surpassed him. It has taken me four years to realize this: I proved a better farmer than he in those moments, not despite my sex, but despite my invalid and ignorant assumption that the best farmer was the one with the most testosterone. My freshman year, I left the farm for boarding school, where I was surrounded by the better-off and the better-educated — the vast majority of whom had heard the word ‘feminism’ before. I began to pick up just what the word meant from my antagonizing English teacher and my incisive friends’ furrowed brows when I described my hometown. Four years of education and weekly argumentative essays taught me the academic jargon. I learned the Latin roots of the word “feminism,” its cognates and its historical consequences. But the more I read about it in books, and the more I used it in my essays, the more I realized I already knew what it meant. I had already embodied the reality of feminism on the farm. I had lived it. My cow had taught it to me.",1,2.553039201,2.834162904,3.085794308,3.489559557,3.016186774,12.0,15.0,22.2,27.6,17.0
C0,10,"As a young girl growing up in rural America, I never thought that farming would be my calling. My parents were farmers, and I watched them work hard every day to make a living from the land. But as I grew older, I began to appreciate the beauty and the importance of agriculture. Now, as a female farmer, I am proud to be part of an industry that feeds our nation and supports our economy. Being a female farmer is not easy. Agriculture is still a male-dominated industry, and it can be challenging to gain respect and recognition as a woman in this field. But I believe that my gender has given me a unique perspective on farming that has helped me to succeed. For me, farming is not just a job, it is a way of life. It is a connection to the land and to the community that cannot be replicated in any other profession. As a female farmer, I have learned to balance the physical demands of the job with the emotional and mental components of running a successful farm. One of the things that I have found most rewarding about farming is the sense of community that it fosters. As a farmer, I am not just responsible for growing crops and raising animals; I am also part of a larger network of farmers, suppliers, and consumers who all play a role in the agricultural industry. This sense of community has taught me the importance of collaboration, communication, and teamwork, skills that are essential for success in any field. Another aspect of farming that I have come to appreciate is the way that it has connected me to the natural world. As a farmer, I am acutely aware of the changing seasons, the weather patterns, and the cycles of growth and decay that govern life on our planet. This connection to nature has given me a sense of purpose and meaning that I believe is rare in modern society. Of course, being a female farmer does come with its challenges. There are still many stereotypes and biases that exist in the industry, and it can be difficult to be taken seriously as a woman. But I believe that my gender has also given me a unique advantage in farming. Women are often seen as nurturing and caring, qualities that are essential in agriculture. As a female farmer, I have learned to cultivate a deep sense of empathy for the animals and plants under my care, and to approach my work with a sense of compassion and understanding. This empathy has made me a better farmer, and has helped me to create a more sustainable and ethical farm operation. As a female farmer, I also bring a different perspective to the industry. Women are often more attuned to the social and environmental impacts of agriculture, and are more likely to prioritize sustainability and community involvement in their work. I believe that these values are essential for the future of farming, and that women have an important role to play in shaping the industry for the better. In conclusion, being a female farmer is not easy, but it is a rewarding and fulfilling way of life. As a woman in agriculture, I have learned the importance of community, connection to nature, and empathy in my work. I believe that my gender has given me a unique advantage in farming, and that women have an important role to play in shaping the future of the agricultural industry. I am proud to be a female farmer, and I hope to inspire other women to pursue careers in agriculture and to help build a more sustainable and equitable food system for us all.",0,2.661612625,2.85280184,3.122724071,3.329248894,2.905627309,15.6,20.0,22.0,26.4,21.0
C1,11,"Growing up on a farm as a girl has given me a unique perspective on feminism. While the concept of gender equality was not always explicitly discussed in my community, it was something that I lived and breathed every day. I never thought of myself as a feminist until I left the farm and encountered people who had a different understanding of what it meant to be a girl in a male-dominated field. Looking back, I realize that my father never wanted me to be a boy. He wanted me to be a farmer. And I was determined to prove that I could be a good one, even if it meant going against traditional gender norms. I learned to be tough, to get my hands dirty, and to work hard. I learned that my worth was not determined by my gender, but by my ability to do the job. And I learned that femininity and masculinity are not mutually exclusive. My cow, Missy, was my first lesson in feminism. She didn't care that I was a girl. She cared that I took good care of her, that I fed her on time, and that I gave her the attention she deserved. She taught me that my gender was irrelevant to my abilities as a farmer. And when we won Best of Show together, it was a triumph not just for me, but for all the girls who were told they couldn't do something because of their gender. Leaving the farm for boarding school was a culture shock for me. Suddenly, I was surrounded by people who had never seen a cow up close, let alone worked with one. And when I talked about my experiences on the farm, I was met with blank stares or condescending comments. It was then that I realized that the values I had learned on the farm were not universal. Not everyone believed that girls could be farmers, or that gender roles were fluid. But the more I learned about feminism in my classes, the more I saw that what I had learned on the farm was, in fact, a form of feminism. Feminism is about breaking down the barriers that hold women back, whether they are social, economic, or cultural. And on the farm, I had broken down those barriers by proving that I could do the same work as the boys. I had shown that girls could be strong, capable, and skilled. And I had challenged the notion that femininity was a weakness. Being a girl in farming has taught me to be resilient, adaptable, and confident. It has taught me that gender is not a limiting factor, but a part of who we are. And it has taught me that feminism is not just an academic concept, but a lived reality. I may not have known the word 'feminism' when I was younger, but I certainly understood what it meant. Today, as I prepare to leave the farm again for college, I am grateful for the lessons I have learned. I am proud to be a girl who loves farming, who takes pride in her work, and who refuses to be held back by gender stereotypes. And I am excited to continue exploring the intersections of feminism and agriculture, to learn more about the ways in which gender affects our relationship with the land and with each other. I may not have grown up in a world where feminism was discussed openly, but I grew up in a world where it was lived every day. And for that, I am grateful.",0,2.417490905,2.590138867,2.726032782,2.929538802,2.61748489,11.4,15.6,19.0,24.0,18.0
C2,12,"I grew up on a farm in rural America, where the sun rose early and the day ended late. Every day began with the chirping of birds and the sound of roosters crowing, and ended with the sound of crickets and cicadas buzzing in the warm summer air. My father was a farmer, and from a young age, I was expected to help with the chores around the farm. As a young girl, I idolized my father's patient hands, which were always busy with farm work. I watched as he tended to the cows, feeding them and milking them every day, without fail. He taught me how to drive a tractor, how to plant and harvest crops, and how to care for animals. I learned the importance of hard work and dedication, and I soon came to realize that my father valued my contributions to the farm just as much as he would have valued a son's. My first show cow was a red and white Holstein named Missy, and she was a handful. She had a mind of her own and was not easily trained, but I persisted. I spent hours each day training her to walk on a lead, to stand still for grooming, and to pose for the judges. I learned how to braid her hair and how to wash and clip her coat until she shone like a diamond in the sun. The smell of cow manure and hay became a comforting scent, reminding me of home and the farm I loved. The day of the show was hot and humid, with the sun beating down on the dusty fairgrounds. Missy was nervous, and so was I. But we worked together, communicating with each other without words. I felt her muscles tense as I led her into the show ring, and I knew she was ready to perform. The crowd was noisy, with the sounds of people talking, cows mooing, and the judges' whistles piercing the air. But I was focused on Missy, and I could feel her trust in me as we walked together in a synchronized dance. When we won Best of Show, my father's eyes filled with tears of pride. It was then that I realized that my gender did not define me, nor did it limit me. I had proven that I could be a successful farmer, just like my father, and that my contributions to the farm were just as valuable as anyone else's. I felt a sense of accomplishment and joy that I had never felt before. Years later, as I reflect on my experiences on the farm, I realize that I was a feminist without even knowing it. I never thought of myself as a feminist, because I did not fully understand what the term meant. But looking back, I see that I was fighting for equality and breaking down gender stereotypes every day. I was doing the work that was traditionally reserved for men, and I was doing it just as well, if not better. Farming taught me that hard work and dedication are the keys to success, regardless of gender. It taught me the value of patience and perseverance, and it showed me that success is not determined by one's gender, but by one's ability and willingness to work hard. It also taught me the importance of being true to oneself, even if it means going against societal norms and expectations. In conclusion, my experiences on the farm have shaped me into the person I am today. I am a feminist, not because I choose to be, but because my experiences have shown me that women are capable of anything. They can be farmers, doctors, lawyers, or anything they want to be.",0,2.448492482,2.754488562,2.885193535,3.134666811,2.799234146,16.0,18.0,20.6,22.8,19.0
H,13,"My grandmother hovers over the stove flame, fanning it as she melodically hums Kikuyu spirituals. She kneads the dough and places it on the stove, her veins throbbing with every movement: a living masterpiece painted by a life of poverty and motherhood. The air becomes thick with smoke and I am soon forced out of the walls of the mud-brick house while she laughs. As for me, I wander down to the small stream at the ridge on the farm’s edge, remembering my father’s stories of rising up early to feed the cows and my mother’s memories of the sweat on her brow from hours of picking coffee at a local plantation. Life here juxtaposes itself profoundly against the life I live in America; the scourge of poverty and flickering prosperity that never seem to coalesce. But these are the two worlds I have inherited, and my existence in one is not possible without the other. At the stream, I recollect my other life beyond this place. In America, I watch my father come home every night, beaten yet resilient from another day of hard work on the road. He sits me and my sister down, and though weary-eyed, he manages the soft smile I know him for and asks about our day. My sister is quick to oblige, speaking wildly of learning and mischief. In that moment, I realize that she is too young to remember our original home: the old dust of barren apartment walls and the constant roar outside of life in the nighttime. Soon after, I find myself lying in bed, my thoughts and the soft throb of my head the only audible things in the room. I ponder whether my parents — dregs floating across a diasporic sea before my time — would have imagined their sacrifices for us would come with sharp pains in their backs and newfound worries, tear-soaked nights and early mornings. But, it is too much to process. Instead, I dream of them and the future I will build with the tools they have given me. Realizing I have mused far too long by the water’s edge, I begin to make my way back to the house. The climb up the ridge is taxing, so I carefully grip the soil beneath me, feeling its warmth surge between my fingers. Finally, I see my younger cousins running around barefoot endlessly and I decide to join their game of soccer, but they all laugh at the awkwardness of the ball between my feet. They play, scream and chant, fully unaware of the world beyond this village or even Nairobi, but I cannot blame them. My iPhone fascinates them and they ask to see my braces, intently questioning how many “shillings” they cost. I open my mouth to satisfy their curiosity, but my grandmother calls out, and we all rush to see what she has made. When I return, the chapatis are neatly stacked on one another, golden-brown disks of sweet bread that are the completion of every Kenyan meal. Before my grandmother can ridicule me in a torrent of Kikuyu, I grab a chapati and escape to find a patch of silky grass, where I take my first bite. Each mouthful is a reminder that my time here will not last forever, and that my success or failure will become a defining example for my sister and relatives. The rift between high school and college is wide, but it is one I must cross for those who have carried me to this point. The same hope that carried my parents over an ocean of uncertainty is now my fuel for the journey toward my future, and I go forward with the radical idea that I, too, can make it. Savoring each bite, I listen to the sound of neighbors calling out and children chasing a dog ridden with fleas, letting the cool heat cling to my skin.",1,2.783053881,2.91768473,3.296798775,3.48316435,3.042717679,18.4,22.0,24.0,29.8,24.0
C0,14,"As a Kenyan-American, I am proud of my heritage and the unique experiences that come with it. Growing up, I struggled to balance the customs and traditions of my Kenyan background with the values and expectations of American culture. However, as I matured, I learned to embrace the intersection of these two cultures and discovered a unique perspective on the world. One of the most important lessons I learned as a Kenyan-American is the value of community. In Kenyan culture, community is highly regarded and emphasized as a central part of life. From a young age, I was taught the importance of family, extended family, and the wider community. This emphasis on community continued as my family and I moved to the United States. Despite the cultural differences, my parents instilled in me a sense of responsibility towards my community. This meant participating in community events, volunteering, and giving back whenever possible. I soon realized that this sense of community was not only valued in Kenyan culture but was also an integral part of American culture. Through my involvement in various community events and volunteer work, I have been able to develop a deep sense of empathy and understanding for those around me. This has allowed me to connect with people from diverse backgrounds and form meaningful relationships. As a result, I have become passionate about using my platform to help those in need. I have organized charity events and fundraisers, and have worked with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity and the Red Cross. My experience as a Kenyan-American has taught me that it is important to use my privilege and resources to support those who are less fortunate. Another lesson that I have learned as a Kenyan-American is the importance of education. In Kenyan culture, education is highly valued and regarded as the key to success. This value has been instilled in me since I was young. However, as a Kenyan-American, I have been able to appreciate the opportunities that education can provide in both Kenya and the United States. While Kenya may lack some of the resources and opportunities available in the United States, the country's emphasis on education has led to an educated population that values learning and innovation. This emphasis on education has also motivated me to work hard in my own academic pursuits. As a Kenyan-American, I have also learned to appreciate the beauty of diversity. Kenya is a melting pot of different cultures and ethnic groups, each with their own traditions and customs. This diversity has taught me to embrace and celebrate differences rather than fear them. As an American, I have been exposed to an even wider range of cultures and perspectives. This has allowed me to broaden my worldview and become more accepting of those who are different from me. Finally, being a Kenyan-American has given me a unique perspective on the world. I have been able to see the world through two distinct lenses, which has allowed me to develop a more nuanced understanding of complex issues. For example, I have been able to appreciate the advantages of living in the United States while also acknowledging the challenges that exist in Kenya. This perspective has given me a sense of humility and has motivated me to use my experiences and education to create positive change. In conclusion, being a Kenyan-American has shaped my worldview in significant ways. It has taught me the importance of community, education, diversity, and perspective. These values have driven me to become an empathetic and driven individual who is committed to using my platform to create positive change. As I embark on the next chapter of my life, I am excited to bring my unique perspective and experiences to whatever challenges lie ahead.",0,2.76709001,2.82912794,3.036535338,3.175643946,2.944330467,14.0,16.0,18.8,23.4,16.5
C1,15,"Growing up as a Kenyan in America, I often found myself torn between two cultures that clashed in ways that were both challenging and enlightening. On one hand, there was the Kenya of my grandparents, where life was simple but rich in tradition and family values. On the other hand, there was the America of my parents, where the pursuit of success often came at the expense of close relationships and cultural roots. These two worlds collided most fiercely during my childhood, when my parents struggled to make ends meet in a new country while also trying to pass on their Kenyan heritage to my sister and me. I remember long hours spent in their small shop in downtown Atlanta, where they sold African clothes and jewelry to customers who often seemed more interested in haggling over prices than in learning about our culture. Despite the challenges we faced, my parents always reminded us of the importance of our heritage and instilled in us a sense of pride in our Kenyan identity. They took us to cultural events and introduced us to family members who had traveled from Kenya to visit us. They also taught us the value of hard work and perseverance, which became the foundation of our pursuit of success in America. As I grew older, I began to appreciate the unique perspective that my Kenyan background gave me on life in America. I saw how the values of community and respect for elders that were central to my Kenyan upbringing contrasted with the individualistic and self-centered culture of America. I also saw how the strong family ties and emphasis on education that were so important in Kenya could help me navigate the challenges of growing up in America. One of the most memorable experiences that shaped my understanding of these cultural differences was a trip I took to Kenya to visit my grandparents. I spent three weeks living with them in their small village, where life was centered around the rhythms of the land and the traditions of the community. I helped my grandmother with her daily chores, learned how to make chapatis, and listened to my grandfather’s stories of life before colonialism. Through this experience, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of cultural heritage and the ways in which it can enrich our lives. I also saw how the values of hard work, community, and respect for elders that were so central to my Kenyan upbringing could be applied to life in America, where they were often undervalued. As I prepare to leave high school and embark on a new journey in college, I carry with me the lessons and values that I have learned from both my Kenyan and American cultures. I know that the road ahead will be challenging, but I am confident that I have the tools and the resilience to navigate it successfully. In the end, the clash of cultures that I experienced growing up has taught me that diversity and difference can be sources of strength, not weakness. By embracing and celebrating our unique backgrounds and perspectives, we can build a more just and equitable world that honors the complexity and beauty of our shared humanity. And it is this radical idea of unity in diversity that I will carry with me as I pursue my dreams and create a better future for myself and those around me.",0,3.233572053,3.287381645,3.458443001,3.709627624,3.382605179,23.0,25.0,27.0,32.0,27.0
C2,16,"Growing up as a Kenyan in America, I constantly found myself at a crossroads of cultures. The two worlds I inhabited could not have been more different - the hustle and bustle of American cities versus the simplicity of Kenyan rural life. However, it was in these differences that I found the beauty of my unique upbringing. I still remember the smells of my grandmother's cooking, the sound of her voice humming traditional Kikuyu spirituals, and the feeling of the warm sun on my face as I sat outside on the porch watching her cook. Every meal was a masterpiece of flavors and aromas, a reflection of her life of poverty and hard work. It was a stark contrast to the fast food culture of America, where meals were often rushed and tasteless. But it wasn't just the food that was different. The landscape, too, was worlds apart. In Kenya, I would wake up to the sound of cows mooing and roosters crowing, and fall asleep to the lullaby of crickets and frogs. The night sky was filled with stars, each one shining bright against the pitch black of the night. In America, the sounds of sirens and cars rushing by replaced the peaceful symphony of nature. The sky was clouded with light pollution, and I could barely make out a handful of stars. Despite these differences, I found myself drawn to both cultures, each one shaping who I am today. In America, I watched my parents work tirelessly to provide for our family, their resilience in the face of hardship inspiring me to push through my own struggles. I remember the long nights my father spent on the road, coming home exhausted but still managing to smile and ask about our day. My sister and I would chatter excitedly, telling him about our latest adventures at school. But it was in Kenya that I found a sense of peace and belonging. I would spend hours wandering the fields and hills, listening to the sound of the wind rustling through the trees and the occasional bleating of a goat. I would run through the tall grass, feeling its texture against my bare legs, and stop to catch my breath by the stream that ran through the farm. There, I would sit and watch as the water flowed past, reflecting the colors of the sky above. It was in those moments that I felt the most connected to my Kenyan roots, a sense of belonging that I had never felt before. Despite being thousands of miles away from the country of my birth, I felt a deep connection to the land and the people who had come before me. I understood the sacrifices that my parents and grandparents had made to give me the opportunities that I have today.

H,17,"As Arthur Read, my favorite aardvark, would say, “Having fun isn’t hard when you’ve got a library card'. Well, it was hard. I didn’t have my library card. Again. The librarian probably had me on “recent history” since this happened so often, so she just looked me up on the computer. I, the little glasses-wearing 9-year-old patron, simply wanted to check out a book, but now I had ​two ​problems: I did not have my library card and my fines were too high to check out. Pulling out the dollar bill I had found in my duct tape wallet, I paid the 20 percent of my fine that let me check out a book and left, gritting my teeth. If I could have checked out a book called “Handling Money for Kids​,” I would have, because most of my “wealth” went right back to the library. Thanks to my mom, I practically had a library card from birth. I would go to my library not just to read books but to be immersed in them. I would find my stool, sit in the children’s area and read. I would get dropped off at the library while my mom worked, and I would follow my usual routine: sit, read, return, repeat, and if I was lucky, check out. The purpose of my visit was usually the same: read books or play on the computer. But as I grew up, I realized that things had begun to change. My mom began coming to the library with us more often. While I would be reading or finishing homework, she would be right there, typing beside me. Our worlds coexisted, but for a reason. For three years, my mother was unemployed. As a single mother, the struggle of not having a job, home or car was immense. I stopped my usual routine and was fine with it. With two tabs open, I continued on with my work. I would log on daily to Zillow, job search websites and websites about stroke rehabilitation for my grandfather, asking if any of my findings would work. “Gracias, mija,” my mom always said, but I realized the stress ensued. We were in different worlds, but they collided. When we had nowhere to live, we would spend hours at the library, using what I thought to be the key to the world: library computers. Whether it was at our childhood library or the library 40 miles away by the farm where we were staying, the library was this stability. Sitting behind the service desk today, I see and hear it all: the little girl begging to check out Junie B. Jones, the boys playing ​Roblox on the computer, the woman filing her taxes, the call from “Sports Guy” asking for the latest results, the woman asking about the weather. I hear Spanish, English, Somali. I get the usual rule-breakers: kids running, out of breath, to the desk asking, “Can I have a Guest Pass?”. At first, the slowly printed receipt is just a number, but I soon realize it is much more. I was once saying, “My mom forgot her card” or “When does the library close?” or “Can I use the phone?” Back then, I was the patron on the computer, the kid in the reading area. Now, I am the specialist at the desk looking up the forgotten library cards. Sitting at the desk does not make me forget my past, it helps me embrace it. The library gives people access to a resource that opens doors in one way for one person, and in others for the next. Even after my mom got a job, the library remained a source of security and comfort. By working at a place that gave me so much, I have learned to give back.

C0,18,"As a child, my local public library was my haven. It was the one place where I could escape the chaos of my household and immerse myself in the world of books. My love for reading started at a young age, and I quickly became a regular at the library. It was there that I discovered the power of knowledge and the endless possibilities that came with it. Growing up, I was part of a family of seven, and we all lived in a tiny two-bedroom apartment. My parents worked long hours to provide for us, and often, they were too exhausted to take us to the park or engage in activities outside the house. As a result, I spent most of my time at home, which could be overwhelming and suffocating. However, my weekly visits to the library gave me something to look forward to. The library was more than just a place to borrow books; it was a place where I could dream and explore. The shelves were lined with books on every topic imaginable, and I could spend hours browsing and selecting new books to read. As I got older, I started to appreciate the library's quiet and peaceful atmosphere. It was a place where I could clear my mind and focus on my studies. My love for books eventually led me to explore other areas of the library, including the reference section. I remember spending hours reading encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other reference books. It was fascinating to learn about new topics and discover new words. The more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew, which motivated me to keep reading and learning. One of my fondest memories of the library was during the summer reading program. Every year, the library would host a program where kids could earn prizes for reading a certain number of books. I remember feeling excited and determined to read as many books as I could. I would spend hours at the library, reading and selecting new books. When I finished a book, I would rush to the librarian to get it stamped and add it to my reading log. It was a fun and rewarding experience that encouraged my love for reading. However, my experiences at the library were not always positive. There were times when I felt out of place or unwelcome. As a minority, I often felt like I didn't belong in such a quiet and peaceful environment. It was a feeling that I couldn't quite explain, but it made me feel uncomfortable nonetheless. However, despite these experiences, I continued to go to the library because I knew that the benefits of learning and exploring outweighed any negative experiences. My experiences at the library have taught me valuable lessons about the power of knowledge and the importance of access to information. The library provided me with a safe space to explore my interests and learn about the world around me. It taught me to appreciate the value of hard work and determination, as I worked hard to earn prizes and achieve my goals. It also taught me the importance of diversity and inclusion, as I learned to appreciate the perspectives of people from all walks of life. In conclusion, the public library played a significant role in shaping who I am today. It provided me with a safe haven and a space to dream and explore. It taught me the value of knowledge and the importance of hard work and determination.

As a curious child, I would always ask my parents to take me to the library, and I was thrilled when I finally got my own library card. Little did I know, the library would play a significant role in my life in the years to come. Growing up, I was fortunate enough to have parents who valued education and encouraged me to read. However, as we moved around frequently due to my father's job, the public library became a constant in my life. No matter where we lived, there was always a library nearby, and it quickly became a sanctuary for me. One summer, my family and I moved to a new state, and I found myself struggling to adjust to my new environment. I missed my friends and my old school, and I felt like an outsider. The one place where I felt comfortable was the public library. I would spend hours there, reading books and exploring new worlds. The library was a source of comfort and familiarity in a time of change. As I grew older, the library continued to play a significant role in my life. When I started high school, I was introduced to the world of research papers and essays. I quickly realized that the library was an invaluable resource. I would spend hours there, pouring over books and articles, trying to find the information I needed to write a compelling paper. The library was not just a place to borrow books, it was a place to learn and grow. In my junior year of high school, my grandfather suffered a stroke, and my family was faced with the daunting task of finding a rehabilitation center for him. We were overwhelmed and had no idea where to start. Once again, the public library came to our rescue. The librarians were incredibly knowledgeable and helped us find the resources we needed to make an informed decision. Thanks to the library, my grandfather received the care he needed, and we were able to make a difficult time a little bit easier. In my senior year of high school, I decided to give back to the library that had given so much to me. I started volunteering at my local library, helping with book drives and community events. It was incredibly rewarding to be able to give back to an institution that had played such a significant role in my life.

It is here, in this sanctuary of knowledge, that I find myself most at peace. I remember the first time my mother took me to the library. I was a wide-eyed five-year-old, in awe of the sheer number of books surrounding me. As we walked down the aisles, I ran my fingers over the spines, feeling the rough texture of the covers against my skin. I remember pulling out a book with a bright yellow cover and flipping through the pages, the sound of rustling paper filling my ears. That book became my companion, taking me on adventures far beyond the confines of my small town. As I grew older, the library became a place of solace. It was where I would retreat to after a long day of school, burying my nose in a book and tuning out the world around me. The worn-out armchair in the corner became my throne, and the musty smell of the cushions became a comforting embrace. I would sit there for hours, lost in a world of fiction, until my mother came to take me home. But as I got older, I began to see the library as more than just a place to escape. It was a place of community, where people of all ages and backgrounds could come together to learn and grow. I remember one afternoon, when I was in the middle of a book, a group of kids ran by, giggling and chasing each other. At first, I was annoyed by the interruption, but then I noticed the smiles on their faces and the joy in their voices. It was a reminder that the library was not just a place for quiet reflection, but also a place for laughter and fun. As I approached my senior year of high school, I realized that the library had become a part of who I was. It was where I went to study, to read, and to reflect. It was where I went to escape the chaos of the outside world and find solace in the pages of a book. And most importantly, it was where I went to find myself. As I sit at the library desk, checking out books and answering questions, I am struck by the sense of gratitude I feel towards this place. It has given me so much over the years, from knowledge to comfort to community. And now, as I prepare to leave for college and embark on the next chapter of my life, I realize that I will carry the lessons I learned here with me always. The library has taught me the importance of community, of coming together to learn and grow. It has taught me the power of a good book, of losing yourself in a story and emerging with a new perspective. And most importantly, it has taught me the value of giving back. Just as the library has given so much to me, I have a responsibility to give back to it, to ensure that it continues to be a place of knowledge, comfort, and community for generations to come. As I close the heavy wooden doors of the library behind me, I am struck by a sense of nostalgia. This place, this sanctuary of knowledge and community, has been a constant in my life for as long as I can remember. And as I move forward into the next phase of my life, I am grateful for the lessons it has taught me and the memories it has given me. It is a place I will always hold dear, a place that will always be a part of who I am.",0,2.659079375,2.79582056,2.927201404,3.099035947,2.891155801,15.0,20.0,22.0,24.8,21.5
H,21,"It was the peak of the day’s heat on July 5, 2017, in the small vacation town of Chatham, Mass. My partner Benjamin and I emerged from the vast backyards of neighboring shoreline homes with big green barrels of garbage held over our backs and dumped them into the back of a garbage truck. As I hopped on the back step to ride to our next stop, I thought about how despite being sweaty, sore, covered in bug bites and garbage juice, I couldn’t have been happier to have this job. Like many kids, I liked trash trucks as a toddler. Unlike most kids, I stuck with it forever. At the age of 8, I joined a community on YouTube of like-minded enthusiasts who posted videos of garbage trucks, under the name “trashmonster26'. I spent a large portion of the next nine years filming all the different models of trash trucks that I could find, not only in my hometown, San Diego, but in Sacramento and Boston, where during family vacations I would take the opportunity to chase different kinds of trucks that couldn’t be found in San Diego. I have such a vast knowledge of these vehicles that I can name the make, model and year of almost any garbage truck in the country after just a glance. The channel has amassed over 6,000 subscribers and four million views over the years. Most of my older friends who shared this interest went on to become garbage collectors when they reached adulthood, a path that my parents strongly discouraged. I always knew growing up that I was going to go to college after high school, but I still wanted the experience of working on a truck. Although there are virtually no hauling companies that hire anyone under 18, I knew of a small family company near my grandparents on the East Coast that might break that norm to fill their need for seasonal help, Benjamin T. Nickerson Inc.  I called their office, and after some persistent follow-up emails, I was hired to work for the summer. To my classmates, moving to a small fishing town and handling other people’s waste all day sounds like the very least enjoyable summer possible. For me, it was one of the most liberating experiences of my life. My day started at the crack of dawn, long before the vacationers in the area would even consider waking up. I was free from the confines of the classroom walls, free from the nagging of my parents. It was just me and the open road. The trash itself was a lens through which I saw what was going on in Chatham. I saw American flags and spent fireworks on the 5th of July. The worst stops of the day were the dumpsters at fish piers, which had a stronger stench than the Chatham Transfer Station, an industrial building where we dumped the day’s load before it was transported to a landfill miles away. At one boat fabrication shop, a dangerous combination of sawdust and reactive chemicals caused a small fire in the truck. There are very few similarities that one could find between my classmates at High Tech High and my customers in Chatham. The kids in my class were from diverse backgrounds and cultural groups all over San Diego. The summer vacation crowd in Chatham was almost exclusively white and wealthy. The one thing that unified them, at least in my mind, was that they were not willing to take on my job. When my classmates thought about applying for jobs, they were thinking about air-conditioned movie theaters and retail stores, not backbreaking manual labor. I’ve considered going into a field relevant to the management of waste, like civil engineering, but I think I may also pursue another passion of mine, like criminal law or political science. I know that no matter what path I choose, this experience will be part of how I end up there.",1,2.798894781,3.106360195,3.274505316,3.543556598,3.241225928,13.6,20.0,22.0,30.8,20.0
C0,22,"As a high school senior, I have had a unique experience that has shaped my outlook on life and taught me invaluable lessons. For the past two years, I have worked as a garbage man, collecting trash from households in my community. This job has not only helped me to develop a strong work ethic, but it has also given me a newfound appreciation for the importance of service to others. When I first started working as a garbage man, I have to admit that I was a bit apprehensive. I was worried about the physical demands of the job and the stigma attached to working in a profession that is often looked down upon by society. However, as I began to interact with the people in my community, I quickly realized that this job was much more than just picking up trash. One of the most profound experiences I had as a garbage man was interacting with the elderly residents in my community. Many of them were homebound and relied on our service to dispose of their waste. As I picked up their trash each week, I would often stop to chat with them and check in on how they were doing. These conversations taught me the importance of human connection and the power of small acts of kindness. Another lesson I learned as a garbage man was the value of hard work. The physical demands of the job were intense, and there were days when I was exhausted and sore. However, I quickly realized that pushing through the discomfort was essential to getting the job done. This mindset has carried over into other aspects of my life, and I now approach challenges with a determination and work ethic that I learned on the back of a garbage truck. One of the most surprising things I discovered as a garbage man was the extent to which our work impacted the environment. Each day, we collected tons of waste that would have otherwise ended up in landfills or polluted our waterways. This experience taught me the importance of responsible waste management and has inspired me to pursue a career in environmental sustainability. Working as a garbage man has also given me a unique perspective on the world around me. I have seen firsthand the amount of waste that we generate as a society, and it has made me more conscious of my own consumption habits. I now make a conscious effort to reduce, reuse, and recycle whenever possible, and I am passionate about educating others on the importance of environmental stewardship. Perhaps the most significant impact that working as a garbage man has had on my life is the way it has shaped my character. In a society that often values material wealth and status above all else, working in a profession that is often dismissed as “lowly” has taught me the importance of humility and service to others. I am proud of the work I do, and I know that it is making a positive impact on the world around me. In conclusion, working as a garbage man in high school has been a transformative experience that has taught me invaluable lessons and shaped my outlook on life. Through this job, I have learned the importance of human connection, the value of hard work, and the impact of responsible waste management. It has given me a unique perspective on the world and inspired me to pursue a career in environmental sustainability. Most importantly, it has taught me the importance of humility and service to others, and I am confident that these values will serve me well in whatever path I choose to take in life.",0,2.687035942,2.914157597,3.056794932,3.290662186,3.012118354,18.2,21.0,23.6,26.8,23.0
C1,23,"As I stood on the back of the garbage truck on a humid summer day, I couldn't help but think about the misconceptions people have about garbage collectors. Most people see the job as dirty, undesirable, and low-paying, but I have come to see it as a valuable and necessary part of our society. Growing up, I never thought I would end up working as a garbageman. In fact, I had my sights set on attending an Ivy League school, like Yale or Harvard. However, as I got older, I began to appreciate the important role that garbage collectors play in keeping our communities clean and healthy. I saw firsthand the impact that waste can have on our environment, and I realized that there is so much more to this job than what meets the eye. Working as a garbageman has given me a unique perspective on life. Each day, I am reminded of the sheer volume of waste that we produce as a society. I see the excess and the waste, but I also see the potential for change. I have become acutely aware of the need for sustainability and the importance of reducing our waste footprint. While the job may be physically demanding, I find it to be mentally stimulating as well. Each day brings a new set of challenges, from navigating narrow streets to handling hazardous materials. I am constantly learning and adapting to new situations, which has helped me develop a strong work ethic and problem-solving skills. Perhaps the most valuable lesson I have learned from my time as a garbageman is the importance of humility. It is easy to overlook the work that we do, but without garbage collectors, our communities would quickly become overwhelmed by waste. I am proud to be part of a team that helps keep our neighborhoods clean and healthy, and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve my community in this way. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a degree in environmental science or sustainability. I want to use my knowledge and skills to help create a more sustainable future for all of us. Whether I end up working in the public sector or the private sector, I know that my experience as a garbageman will inform my work and help me to be a more effective agent of change. In conclusion, I believe that being a garbageman is much more than just a job. It is an opportunity to serve our communities, to make a difference in the world, and to gain valuable skills and experiences. I am proud to have worked in this field, and I know that my time as a garbageman has prepared me well for whatever challenges lie ahead.

C2,24,"As the sun rose over the small town of Bedford, Massachusetts, I heaved myself out of bed and got ready for my first day on the job as a garbageman. I had always been fascinated by the mechanics of trash trucks and was excited to finally experience the ins and outs of the industry firsthand. As I arrived at the waste management facility, the pungent smell of garbage filled my nostrils, mixing with the sound of the trucks idling and the shouts of the workers. I donned my fluorescent vest and gloves and headed out to begin my route, driving slowly through the suburban streets and picking up the black garbage bags that lined the curbs. Despite the intense physical labor, I found myself exhilarated by the rhythm of the job. The constant motion of throwing bags, hauling them to the truck, and then dumping them in with a satisfying crunch was strangely addictive. Each stop brought a new set of challenges, from maneuvering around parked cars to dodging overhanging branches, but I relished the opportunity to problem-solve on the fly. One of my most memorable stops was at the home of an elderly woman who had passed away unexpectedly. Her family had already cleared out most of her belongings, but there were still a few bags of trash left behind. As I lifted them into the truck, I couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness for this woman I had never met. Her possessions, once so important to her, now reduced to mere refuse. Another particularly challenging stop was at a construction site where the workers had left a massive pile of debris. I was intimidated at first, but quickly got to work, hauling out chunks of wood and drywall with all my might. As the pile slowly diminished, I felt a sense of pride in my ability to take on this difficult task and come out victorious. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of my summer job was the sense of community I felt among my coworkers. Despite coming from vastly different backgrounds, we bonded over our shared experiences on the job, exchanging tips and stories during our lunch breaks. The camaraderie we built in such a short amount of time was truly remarkable. Looking back on my time as a garbageman, I realize how much I gained from the experience. It taught me the value of hard work, perseverance, and problem-solving, skills that I know will serve me well in whatever path I choose to pursue. More than that, it gave me a new appreciation for the people who work tirelessly behind the scenes to keep our communities clean and functioning. The next time I see a garbage truck on the street, I'll think of the countless hours that go into making our world a better place, one bag at a time.",0,2.79103765,2.953879143,3.127767189,3.467871715,2.980299957,19.0,21.0,24.0,27.0,23.0
H,25,"My kitchen is largely occupied by my old, dirty, warm-brown dinner table. It’s seen better days. Every time I sit down, I’m surrounded by splatters of old paint, hot glue and the occasional dab of nail polish (that’s thanks to my older sisters). Whenever I sit at either of our two chairs, I have to be extra careful they don’t fall apart because the legs are held together by a tedious mixture of wood glue, brute force and pure spite. The kitchen table itself has been the hub of my family for the entire first half of my life. When I was younger, we (my Gram, Pap and two older sisters) would eat a home-cooked meal, courtesy of my Gram, at that old, dirty, warm-brown dinner table at exactly 7 pm every single night. At these family dinners, I would argue with my Pap for fun, watch him get yelled at by my Gram for interrupting me eating my dinner and listen to my sisters either fight or joke; it was always a gamble. Originally, my kitchen table had five sturdy wooden seats. A couple years later when my oldest sister was 16 years old and I was 8, the chair count lowered to four, as my oldest sister moved out. She fought too much with my Gram and wouldn’t follow the rules, so she left. Three years later my grandmother was diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer. That triggered a few more changes to our dinner table routine. First, my other older sister started to skip dinners. Not because of the inevitable food quality decline (cancer messes with your taste buds and overall cooking abilities), but because she was never home. I don’t think that she wanted to be around post-cancer-diagnosis Gram. The chair count dropped to three. The dinners themselves after a year or so were much less frequent, not so much because of my Gram, but because my Pap was determined to make Gram rest. She ignored my Pap’s concerns, so it sort of ended up in a middle gray area that I had to live in. A year and a half after my grandmother got cancer, she died. It may sound quick in words, but it was pretty dragged out. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandmother, but people with cancer are usually dead long before they die. I was there when she died, right smack dab in the middle of our living room. I was on one side of the bed, and my Pap was on the other. Her labored breaths slowed and then stopped. It sounds depressing, but it was sort of a happy moment. The first thing my Pap said was “Give her a hug, you can’t hurt her now'. And, despite the phlegmy cancer smell, I did. We only needed two chairs. After that, Pap and I, with the remnants of our nontraditional American family, built an extra nontraditional family. It took a while before we stabilized ourselves, because, to be honest, we were low-income before grandma got cancer, but post-cancer was much worse. Pap and I cut down on everything. We got rid of our cable, phone and internet. We used less oil, we used less water, we wasted less food, and at times we didn’t have a car because our minivan took up a bunch of gas and liked to break down frequently. But, despite a dreadfully boring WiFi-less and phoneless year, we made it through. I still live in the same house, except now it has Wi-Fi. Our kitchen table is still standing, though we took the center piece of wood out so now it’s the perfect size for just the two of us. We don’t have nightly dinners anymore, but sometimes Pap and I sit on the couch and hang out. Sure, maybe our coffee table chats aren’t the same as our nightly family dinners, and maybe our television doesn’t turn on anymore. Maybe our kitchen has ants, and maybe we have to listen to the Super Bowl on our outdated radio from the ’90s, and maybe, possibly, he is getting sicker now, too. I don’t care that my new life revolves around a holey old couch, a grumpy old man, a couple of fat cats and a bearded dragon. I’m content with my Pap, and I’m content with the fact that every night at 7 pm, two empty chairs surround my old, dirty, warm-brown dinner table in the darkness of my kitchen. These days, the lights are on in the living room.",1,2.273329417,2.598201518,2.892865499,3.33737514,2.677433434,9.2,12.0,18.6,27.0,15.5
C0,26,"It was the summer before my senior year of high school when my grandma passed away. Losing her was one of the most painful experiences I have ever gone through, but it was also one of the most beautiful. Growing up, my grandma was always a constant in my life. She was the one who would pick me up from school, bake me cookies, and teach me how to knit. We would sit for hours on end, talking about everything and anything. She was my confidante, my mentor, and my best friend. I never imagined a world without her in it. When she got sick, it was a shock to everyone. We all thought that she was invincible, that nothing could bring her down. But cancer has a way of humbling even the strongest among us, and it wasn't long before we were faced with the reality that we might lose her. The months leading up to her passing were some of the most difficult of my life. I watched as my once-vibrant grandma became weaker and weaker. I watched as she lost her hair and her appetite. I watched as she struggled to walk and to breathe. It was heartbreaking, and yet, there was a beauty in it. As my grandma's condition worsened, I began to notice something remarkable happening. My family, who had always been close, grew even closer. We spent more time together, we talked more openly and honestly, and we loved more fiercely. We rallied around my grandma, determined to make the most of the time we had left with her. During this time, I also learned a lot about myself. I learned that I was stronger than I ever thought possible. I learned that I had a deep capacity for empathy and compassion. And I learned that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope. When my grandma passed away, it felt like a part of me had died with her. But even in my grief, I was able to find solace in the fact that I had been there for her until the very end. I had held her hand, I had told her how much I loved her, and I had said goodbye. It was a painful goodbye, but it was also a beautiful one. Losing my grandma was a turning point in my life. It made me realize how precious our time on this earth is, and how important it is to make the most of every moment. It also made me appreciate the power of family and love, and how they can get us through even the toughest of times. As I look towards my future, I know that my grandma will always be with me. Her legacy of love and resilience will guide me as I navigate the challenges ahead. And while I will always mourn her loss, I will also celebrate the life she lived and the impact she had on all those who knew her. In conclusion, losing my grandma was one of the most painful experiences I have ever gone through, but it was also one of the most beautiful. Through her illness and passing, I learned the power of family, love, and resilience. I learned to cherish every moment and to never take a single day for granted. And I learned that even in the darkest of times, there is always a glimmer of hope. While I will always miss my grandma, I am grateful for the time we had together and for the lessons she taught me. I know that she will always be a part of me, and that she will continue to inspire me for the rest of my life.",0,2.34399258,2.461217243,2.59274305,2.82968327,2.523503333,10.0,12.0,16.0,23.0,15.0

This table has been the center of our family for as long as I can remember, but as I approach my senior year of high school, I realize that it has become much more than just a place to eat. My family is large and loud, filled with cousins, aunts, uncles, and grandparents. When we all gather around the table for a family dinner, the noise level can be overwhelming. But the chaos is part of what makes it so special. There's always someone cracking a joke or telling a story, and we all share in the laughter and joy. But the kitchen table has also seen its share of sorrow. My grandfather passed away when I was just seven years old, and I remember sitting at this table with my family, tears streaming down our faces as we mourned his loss. It was a devastating time, but we leaned on each other and found comfort in our shared grief. Despite the challenges, my family has always been there for me, and this table has been a constant source of comfort and support. I remember sitting here with my parents, working through math problems and studying for exams. And when I announced my college plans, my family cheered and celebrated with me at this very table. But there's one person who is noticeably absent from our gatherings, my grandmother. She passed away when I was just a young child, and I never had the opportunity to know her. Yet, her presence is still felt at the table. My family tells stories about her and shares memories of her cooking and caring for them. As I prepare to leave for college, I realize that this old, worn kitchen table will always hold a special place in my heart. It has seen me through good times and bad, and it has been the center of our family for generations. As I sit here, surrounded by the memories of those who have come before me, I feel grateful for the love and support that this table has provided. But I also recognize that this table is just a physical object. What truly matters is the people who sit around it. My family may be flawed and imperfect, but they have always been there for me when I needed them most. And I know that no matter where I go or what I do, they will continue to be my biggest cheerleaders. As I look to the future, I know that I will encounter new challenges and opportunities. But I also know that I have the love and support of my family behind me, and that is something that will never change. Whether I'm sitting at a new kitchen table or in a college classroom, I will always carry the memories of this old, worn table with me. In the end, it's not about the table itself.

C2,28,"The kitchen table has always been the heart of my childhood home. It's a sturdy oak table with scratches and dents, each mark telling a story of its own. The sound of the wooden chairs scraping against the tile floor and the clinking of utensils against plates is the soundtrack of my childhood memories. The table was where we had our family meals, from weekday dinners to special occasions. The smell of freshly cooked food would waft through the air, filling the room with the aroma of home-cooked meals. The sight of my mother's famous lasagna, layered with ricotta cheese and tomato sauce, would make my mouth water in anticipation. The soft texture of the mashed potatoes and the crispy skin of the roasted chicken were a perfect combination, a balance of flavors that always satisfied my hunger. But the table was more than just a place to eat. It was where we did our homework, played board games, and shared our thoughts and dreams. The table was where we laughed until our sides hurt, where we cried until our tears ran dry. It was where we celebrated our triumphs and supported each other through our failures. One of my fondest memories of the table was when my grandfather came to visit us from out of town. He was one of the most resilient people in my life, having survived wars, famine, and illness. As we sat at the table, he shared stories of his past, of the struggles and triumphs that had shaped him into the person he was. His eyes shone with a deep wisdom and understanding that only came from a life fully lived. As he spoke, I noticed his hands, rough and calloused from years of hard work. His fingers, crooked from years of arthritis, moved deftly across the table as he gestured and emphasized his words. His hands were a symbol of his resilience, a testament to his ability to overcome even the toughest of challenges. The table was also where we had difficult conversations, where we confronted the challenges of life head-on. It was where we discussed illness, death, and loss. It was where we learned to listen, to empathize, and to support one another through life's toughest moments. Even now, as an adult, the kitchen table remains a central part of my life. It's where I gather with friends over coffee, where I work on my laptop, and where I share meals with my own family. It's where I feel most at home, surrounded by the familiar sights, sounds, and smells of my childhood. In conclusion, the kitchen table is not just a piece of furniture. It's a symbol of the love, support, and resilience that have shaped my life.

H,29,"Not many 17-year-old girls know how to solder two copper pipes together or light the pilot light on a water heater. I venture that most people would struggle to tell the difference between a regular 90-degree PVC elbow and a street 90. These are skills and distinctions I have learned over the past five years as an assistant to my dad in his one-man plumbing business. My summer job involves messes that constantly elicit physical and mental discomfort, and the work demands an attitude of grittiness and grace that I frequently struggle to adopt. Nevertheless, I persist. I am the plumber’s daughter and the plumber’s helper. Each humid morning, I wrestle myself into a pair of used men’s jeans from Goodwill that most of my peers would refuse to be seen wearing in public. I slip my tape measure onto my belt, tie my hair back as I run out the door, and climb into the passenger seat of the plumber truck, which is really an aged white minivan with two kinds of pipes strapped to the top. As my peers begin their shifts nannying, lifeguarding or checking out groceries, my dad and I haul unwieldy toolboxes and heavy-duty saws into the depths of people’s houses. Although at times we work in the gold-plated master bathrooms of mansions with lake views, we usually end up in dank, mildewed basements where I get lost in mazes of storage boxes looking for the water meter. Five summers navigating the pipes of Milwaukee have taught me that the messy parts of people’s houses reflect the messy parts of their lives. My dad and I make plenty of our own messes too. When his rugged Sawzall blade slices through walls, clouds of plaster permeate the air. Sometimes there are no walls at all, and we work in primordial jungles of fiberglass insulation, floor joists and rusted cast iron stacks. I constantly leap over tangled piles of wrenches and extension cords. My mouth and nose are covered by a dust mask; my jeans are smudged with pipe dope, and my hands are blackened with the grime of a hard day’s work. As I observe the chaos around me, chaos rises within me. Nothing is beautiful or tidy; everything I see is ugly. I feel powerless, frustrated and unable to think clearly. Plumbing work is a microcosm of the messes of the world, and sometimes I despise it. I question why I endure the dust and sweat when I could be in my air-conditioned house, vacuuming my bedroom, making avocado toast for breakfast and finishing my summer homework early. I could even find another job, a normal one that more closely resembles the work of my peers. Yet as much as I despise the mess of plumbing, I despise myself for becoming affected by such trivial qualms and for being so easily aggravated by disorder. After all, the world was built by people willing to get their hands dirty. And when I think about it, I cope with messes all the time. The uncertainties and contradictions of my teenage brain are far more tangled than any extension cord, but I keep trying to sort them out. Life is a process of accepting the messes and learning to clean them up, and plumbing work is no different. As much as my dad and I create chaos, we create order, and if I look carefully I can find it in each newly soldered array of copper pipes or in the way my dad’s toolboxes all fit together in the back of his van. Moreover, when customers express gratitude for our work, I understand that, in a small way, we bring order to their lives. The physical and mental discomforts of plumbing are worth it.",1,2.445542325,2.780963463,3.15864156,3.424272887,3.111595867,11.0,17.2,23.4,28.0,21.0
C0,30,"As a female plumber, I often encounter surprise, skepticism, and even outright disbelief when I tell people about my profession. Many assume that I am either lying or mistaken, and that I must be referring to some other job. But the truth is that I am a proud and successful plumber, and I have learned a lot about myself, my abilities, and the world around me through this unconventional career path. For starters, being a female plumber has taught me that gender stereotypes are alive and well in our society, even in supposedly progressive and liberal circles. People often assume that plumbing is a man's job, and that women are not strong, skilled, or knowledgeable enough to do it. But I have found that these assumptions are not based on any objective reality, but rather on deeply ingrained biases and cultural norms that persist despite decades of social change. Despite these challenges, I have also learned that being a female plumber can be an advantage in certain situations. For example, many of my clients feel more comfortable having a woman work on their plumbing, especially if they are elderly, disabled, or have young children at home. They appreciate my attention to detail, my communication skills, and my ability to work efficiently and cleanly. In fact, some of my clients have even become my strongest advocates, recommending me to their friends and family members and helping to spread the word about my services. Moreover, being a female plumber has taught me a lot about the value of hard work, perseverance, and problem-solving. Plumbing is not an easy job, and it requires a lot of physical and mental effort. But I have found that the rewards of a job well done are immense, both in terms of personal satisfaction and financial stability. Plumbing has allowed me to earn a good living, support myself financially, and even save up for my future goals, such as college or starting my own business. Perhaps most importantly, being a female plumber has taught me that we can all challenge and change the status quo, in our own small ways. By defying gender stereotypes and pursuing my passion for plumbing, I am not only making a difference in my own life, but also in the lives of those around me. I am showing other women and girls that they can be anything they want to be, regardless of their gender or social background. I am inspiring others to question their assumptions and biases, and to consider new and unconventional paths in life. In conclusion, being a female plumber has been a unique and transformative experience, one that has taught me a lot about myself, my abilities, and the world around me. It has allowed me to challenge gender stereotypes, to earn a good living, and to make a positive impact on others. And while I may encounter skepticism and doubt from some quarters, I am confident in my abilities and in the value of my work. I am proud to be a female plumber, and I hope to inspire others to follow their own unconventional dreams, whatever they may be.",0,2.770120193,2.854541037,3.060618581,3.418265438,2.956901693,19.0,22.4,24.6,28.8,23.5
C1,31,"As a 17-year-old female plumber, I stand out in a male-dominated industry. When I tell people that I want to pursue a career in plumbing, I am often met with surprise, followed by a barrage of questions about how I got interested in this field. To be honest, I didn't set out to become a plumber. It all started when my family was going through a rough patch financially, and my mom lost her job. My dad, who had been a plumber for over 20 years, needed help in his business. He asked me if I wanted to work with him during the summer, and I decided to give it a try. At first, I was apprehensive. I didn't know anything about plumbing, and the thought of working with my dad all day didn't sound like much fun. However, as I started learning the trade, I realized that I had a knack for it. I enjoyed the physical work and the problem-solving that came with it. I also loved spending time with my dad and learning from him. Over the years, I have learned a lot about plumbing, from the basics of soldering and pipe fitting to the more complex aspects of drain cleaning and fixture installation. I have also learned about the importance of customer service and the value of hard work. Working as a plumber's assistant has given me a unique perspective on life. I have seen how the messiness of people's homes can reflect the messiness of their lives. I have witnessed firsthand how a broken pipe can cause chaos and disruption in a household. But I have also seen how a skilled plumber can bring order and calm to a chaotic situation. One of the things I love about plumbing is that it is a constantly evolving field. There is always something new to learn, whether it's a new tool or technique, or a new plumbing code. As a young person, I am excited to be part of an industry that is adapting to new technologies and changing customer needs. I also believe that plumbing is a field that can make a real difference in people's lives. Access to clean water and safe plumbing is a basic human right, and yet millions of people around the world lack these basic necessities. By becoming a plumber, I hope to make a positive impact in my community and beyond. Of course, there are challenges to being a female plumber in a male-dominated industry. I have had to deal with stereotypes and assumptions about what women are capable of. I have had to work harder to prove myself and earn respect from my colleagues and customers. But I believe that these challenges have made me stronger and more determined. In many ways, my experience as a female plumber has taught me valuable lessons about perseverance and resilience. It has shown me that I am capable of doing things that others might not expect of me. And it has given me a sense of purpose and pride in my work. As I prepare to apply to college, I know that my background as a plumber's assistant will set me apart from other applicants. But more than that, it has given me a unique perspective on life and work that I believe will serve me well in any field I choose to pursue. Whether I end up studying engineering or business or something else entirely, I know that the lessons I have learned as a plumber's assistant will stay with me for the rest of my life. And who knows? Maybe one day I'll start my own plumbing business, and I'll be the one teaching my own daughter how to solder two copper pipes together.",0,2.546681934,2.648883215,2.799852142,3.009188591,2.768500536,13.0,16.0,18.0,23.0,16.0
C2,32,"As I step into my dad's aged white minivan, my senses are immediately overwhelmed. The stench of mold and mildew fills my nostrils, and I can almost taste the musty air. The inside of the van is a mess, with tools and equipment strewn haphazardly about. I struggle to find a place to sit among the clutter, the rough texture of the old seats rubbing against my skin. We drive through the winding streets of Milwaukee, passing by grand mansions with lush lawns and sparkling pools. I can hear the sounds of laughter and splashing from their backyards, a stark contrast to the grimy basements and unkempt yards where we usually work. I close my eyes and take a deep breath, steeling myself for what lies ahead. As we enter our first job site of the day, I am hit with the overwhelming heat and humidity of a midwestern summer. The air is thick and oppressive, and I feel sweat forming on my skin almost instantly. We make our way down to the basement, where I am greeted by the familiar sight of pipes and ductwork snaking their way across the ceiling. The walls are stained with water damage, and the floor is slick with condensation. My dad hands me a pair of men's jeans from Goodwill, the fabric worn and frayed. I slip them on, the rough texture rubbing against my skin. We begin to haul our tools and equipment down the stairs, the weight of the boxes and saws making my muscles ache. The work is physical and demanding, requiring a level of grit and perseverance that I never knew I possessed. As we start to diagnose the problem, I can hear the sounds of our tools echoing through the house. The whir of the Sawzall, the clank of the wrench, and the hiss of the torch all blend together into a cacophony of noise. The sounds are jarring, and I feel my teeth rattling in my head. Despite the chaos of our work, there is a certain beauty in the way that we bring order to the mess. The copper pipes that we solder together gleam in the dim light, and the newly installed water heater hums softly in the background. I feel a sense of pride and satisfaction in our work, knowing that we have made a difference in someone's life. As I reflect on my experiences as a plumber's daughter, I realize that the work is a metaphor for life itself. Just as we must navigate the twists and turns of a complex plumbing system, we must also navigate the complexities of our own lives. We must learn to embrace the mess, to find beauty in the chaos. We must be willing to get our hands dirty, to face the discomfort and uncertainty head-on. Through my work as a plumber's assistant, I have learned the value of hard work, perseverance, and resilience. I have discovered a strength within myself that I never knew existed, and I have developed a sense of pride in my ability to take on any challenge. I have learned to appreciate the beauty in the mess, to find order in the chaos. As I prepare to embark on the next chapter of my life, I am confident that the lessons I have learned through my work as a plumber's daughter will serve me well. I am ready to embrace the challenges and uncertainties that lie ahead, knowing that I have the strength and determination to succeed.

H,33,"“No more broken plates, you understand?”. I could make little sense of the broken English that spat from his mouth but his scrunched-up face spoke a universal language. It was a Friday night in Little Tokyo, and while families were eating five-star meals in the front dining room, a 14-year-old boy was in the back washing their dishes. Wash the plates by hand, dump them into the sanitizer, place the plates into the machine, dry the plates off, return the plates to their designated spot and repeat — hopefully without damaging any. On this night though, a porcelain plate slipped through my soapy fingers and shattered onto the floor in five pieces. My face flushed even as I tried to keep my composure, but inside I was screaming, “Why me!?” as if my scream would make the plate whole again. The shattered plate was only one of the many worries fighting relentlessly inside my head for attention — there was the Advanced Placement United States history midterm, a low grade in calculus, the eviction notice, a little brother getting into trouble and a dozen other smaller but pressing concerns. For me, there was no calling in sick to clear my head, getting some much needed rest or carving out study time before an upcoming exam. I had to contribute to the necessities. I shut up, got back to work and pushed with all the energy I had left. I knew all too well the symptoms of bottling up my emotions — the bitter taste of salt in each drop of sweat, losing myself in the background music and the muscle aches were nothing new to me. It was 12 am when my shift finally ended. I boarded the bus home and took out my notes to study. I got the usual looks from people fresh out of bars or parties, either because of the stench of a hard night’s work on my clothes or because I was muttering to myself while feverishly flipping flashcards on a bus in the middle of the night. Their stares didn’t bother me at all. I was used to those too, and they were nothing more than another set of speed bumps in the way of achieving my goals. I was tired of seeing childhood friends flashing gang signs, relatives glued to the beer bottle or my dad coming home late at night with burn scars from work. Something had to change and I knew it fell to me to initiate that change. Fortunately, I also knew I had dedication, desire and grit in my blood. My grandfather was part of the first wave of Mexican immigrants that settled in Los Angeles. He returned home to a small village in rural Oaxaca, with his savings and tales of the land of opportunity. Both of my parents left Oaxaca in their early teenage years and began working long hours in Los Angeles, as a cook and a maid. The work ethic was passed down generations; from the cornfields in Oaxaca, to the restaurants in Los Angeles, to the classroom, which helped me thrive both in school and work. On this particular night, as I walked through the front door at home, I saw an uplifting surprise: My mother had fallen asleep waiting up for me despite her own long day. I tucked the cash tips I made that night into her purse and turned off the TV. I peered into our bedroom where my brothers and cousins were lost in their blissful dreams. Watching my siblings snore and breathe slowly sparked a yawn that cued the rest of my body’s delayed exhaustion. However, it would be a while before I could join them in sleep. I had an essay due early the next morning, and Ms. DePaolo doesn’t accept late work.",1,2.307546792,2.829763841,3.067568593,3.592026738,2.993609725,12.8,16.0,20.8,30.0,18.5
C0,34,"As I stand in front of the industrial-sized sink, my hands submerged in soapy water, I can't help but reflect on my journey as a dishwasher. At first glance, my job may seem insignificant and menial, but it has taught me some of the most valuable lessons I've learned in my life. Growing up in a low-income household, I've had to work since I was fourteen years old to help support my family. My first job was at a local fast-food restaurant, where I quickly found myself working my way up from a cashier to a line cook, and eventually to a dishwasher. Despite the long hours and low pay, I found myself drawn to the fast-paced environment of the kitchen and the satisfaction of seeing the results of my hard work. But it wasn't until I started working as a dishwasher that I truly began to understand the value of hard work and the importance of taking pride in even the smallest tasks. As a dishwasher, my job is to ensure that the dishes, pots, and pans are cleaned and sanitized so that they can be reused. While this may seem like a simple task, it requires a great deal of attention to detail and a strong work ethic. As I scrub away at the grime and grease, I've come to realize that my work is an essential part of the kitchen's ecosystem. Without clean dishes, the cooks would not be able to prepare food, the servers would not be able to serve, and the restaurant would not be able to function. Being a dishwasher has taught me that every job, no matter how small, is crucial to the success of a team. Beyond the importance of hard work, being a dishwasher has also taught me the value of teamwork and communication. In a busy kitchen, every member of the team must work together seamlessly to ensure that orders are prepared and served in a timely manner. This requires clear communication and a willingness to work together towards a common goal. As a dishwasher, I've had the opportunity to work with people from all walks of life, each with their unique strengths and weaknesses. Through this experience, I've learned how to effectively communicate with my coworkers, delegate tasks, and offer assistance when needed. Being a dishwasher has taught me that successful teamwork is not about individual success but rather about working together towards a common goal. But perhaps the most valuable lesson I've learned as a dishwasher is the importance of perseverance and resilience. Working in a fast-paced kitchen is not for the faint of heart. The long hours, hot and humid environment, and physically demanding work can take a toll on even the most dedicated worker. However, I've learned to push through the exhaustion and keep going, knowing that my hard work and dedication will pay off in the end. Through the trials and tribulations of being a dishwasher, I've learned to persevere through even the most challenging of circumstances. This has taught me the value of resilience and determination, qualities that I know will serve me well in any future endeavors. In conclusion, being a dishwasher may seem like a small and insignificant job, but it has taught me some of the most valuable lessons of my life. It has taught me the importance of hard work, teamwork, communication, and perseverance. Through this experience, I've learned that every job, no matter how small, is essential to the success of a team. As I look towards the future and my aspirations of attending a top-tier university like Yale or Harvard, I know that the lessons I've learned as a dishwasher will serve me well and set me apart from my peers. I am confident that my experiences will allow me to excel in any challenges I may face in the future and contribute meaningfully to any community I am a part of.",0,2.7278239,2.945933376,3.025402687,3.157185,2.973893406,19.4,21.8,24.0,28.2,23.0
C1,35,"The clanking of dishes filled my ears as I stepped into the cramped kitchen. The chef barked orders to the line cooks and servers rushed in and out to pick up their orders. My shift as a dishwasher at the local diner had just begun, and I knew it was going to be a long night. I didn't mind the work. I had grown used to the routine of scrubbing plates, loading them into the dishwasher, and stacking them back onto the shelves. But what I really enjoyed was the moments of quiet that came between the chaos. As I washed the dishes, my mind would drift away to another world, where I could escape from the stress of school and the pressure of college applications. But there was one moment that stood out to me. It was a night like any other, except that I was working a double shift to make some extra money. My arms were sore, my feet were aching, and my eyes were heavy. I was exhausted. As I was scrubbing a stubborn stain off a plate, I heard a voice behind me. Hey, you missed a spot, said a customer who had wandered into the kitchen. I turned around to see an elderly man with a kind smile on his face. I was taken aback by his friendliness. I had always assumed that customers saw me as nothing more than a lowly dishwasher, invisible and insignificant. But this man saw me as a person, someone worth talking to. We struck up a conversation, and I learned that he was a retired professor from a nearby university. He told me about his research on ancient civilizations, and I told him about my love for history. We talked for what felt like hours, until the chef finally shooed him out of the kitchen. As I continued with my work, I couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth in my heart. That little conversation had made my night. It reminded me that there was more to life than just grades and college applications, that there were kind people out there who saw beyond my job title. That night, I went home feeling grateful. Grateful for the opportunity to work, to earn money for my family, to have a roof over my head. Grateful for the little moments of connection that made the drudgery of dishwashing worthwhile. But most of all, I felt grateful for the reminder that I was not defined by my job. I was a student, a friend, a brother, a son. I was someone with dreams and aspirations beyond the walls of that diner. As I sit down to write this essay, I think back to that night in the kitchen. I realize that it wasn't just about washing dishes. It was about finding meaning in the mundane, about recognizing the humanity in everyone, about being grateful for what I have. And so, as I apply to college, I bring with me the lessons I learned as a dishwasher. I bring my dedication to hard work, my resilience in the face of adversity, my appreciation for the little moments that make life worth living. I may not have the impressive extracurriculars or the perfect SAT score, but I have something just as valuable: a unique perspective on the world. I have seen firsthand the struggles and joys of working-class life, and I am ready to bring that perspective to the halls of Yale or Harvard. I may still have to wash dishes to pay for college, but I know that I am more than just a dishwasher. I am a learner, a thinker, a doer.

C2,36,"Dishwashing is a job that often goes unnoticed. It's a task that many people overlook, yet it's one of the most critical components of a successful restaurant. For me, it's a job that has taught me invaluable lessons about hard work, dedication, and perseverance. The restaurant was in the heart of the city, bustling with people and noise. The sounds of laughter, clinking silverware, and sizzling food filled the air. I was in the back, standing in front of the sink with soapy water up to my elbows. The scorching hot water dripped down my arms, and the smell of detergent stung my nose. I had to shout over the kitchen's noise to hear my co-workers, and sometimes, we communicated through hand gestures. Despite the chaotic environment, I found solace in the predictability of my work. I had a system down pat, from washing the dishes by hand to sanitizing them, drying them, and returning them to their designated spots. It was a routine that required precision and speed, but it was also therapeutic in a way. One evening, however, I dropped a porcelain plate. It shattered into five pieces on the hard concrete floor, and I felt my heart drop. My co-workers glanced my way, but they didn't say anything. I could feel my face turn red with embarrassment. I knew I had to clean up the mess, but it was difficult to keep my hands steady as I picked up the shards of broken glass. That shattered plate was emblematic of my life at the time. I was overwhelmed with responsibilities, from my Advanced Placement United States history midterm to my low grade in calculus. My family was also facing financial difficulties, and I had to work long hours to help make ends meet. But I had no choice but to keep going. I couldn't call in sick or take a break. I had to push through the pain and the exhaustion. Despite the challenges I faced, I found inspiration in my family's resilience. My grandfather was part of the first wave of Mexican immigrants that settled in Los Angeles. He worked hard to save money and provide for his family. Both of my parents left Oaxaca in their early teenage years and began working long hours in Los Angeles. Their work ethic was passed down through the generations, and I knew I had it in me too. There were times when I felt like giving up, but I knew that wasn't an option. I wanted to make my family proud and give them the life they deserved. I wanted to break the cycle of poverty and create a better future for myself and my community. I knew that the only way to achieve those goals was through hard work and perseverance. At the end of my shift, I boarded the bus home, exhausted but fulfilled. The bright lights of the city passed me by as I gazed out the window, lost in thought. I was grateful for the lessons I had learned through dishwashing, and I was proud of the person I had become. I had learned the value of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. I had learned that success doesn't come easy, but it's always within reach if you're willing to work for it. In conclusion, dishwashing is a job that has taught me invaluable lessons about life. It's taught me the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance, and it's given me the resilience to overcome any obstacle that comes my way.

H,37,"Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico, and my Massachusetts city had also been torn apart. In a city where nearly half of the population is Puerto Rican, the destination of people fleeing the island had immediately come into question, “Why are they coming here? Our schools already don’t have enough books for our students, never mind Puerto Rican refugees.” These are words out of my French and Irish uncle’s mouth. As he looked in my brown eyes and proclaimed his son’s lack of an AP English book was more important than the life and well-being of a child that looks like me. It is enlightening to begin to take notice of the ignorance that surrounds your identity. It is eye-opening to hear words of hate and intolerance spew from the mouths of people you love, people who claim to love you. I have heard people express how they really feel when they forget about my dark complexion and let a joke slip, to follow up with, “Well not you, you're not really Puerto Rican.' To be seven years old and shrouded in a feeling of discomfort for who you are; making an effort to sound and act “white” among my white family and friends. Thanksgiving with my blue-eyed and freckled cousins was an event that displaced me. My Abuela’s house was where my Puerto Rican cousins flourished. They spoke fluent Spanish and shook their heads when I asked what they were saying. I “didn’t care” about my culture to them. It is in this limbo that I find myself more aware of the dubious eyes on me when I’m asked if I am Muslim or Italian (as if Muslim is an ethnicity). When they compliment my “different” name, their eyes widen when they learn that I am from the “whiter” side of the city, but nod in understanding when I clarify that my Mother is white. I notice that these glances are consonant with the fact that the grocery store I work at in the neighboring town made thousands of dollars in their donation cups for Hurricane Harvey victims, but not one mention of Puerto Rico’s disastrous conditions. It is from these glances that I realize both these adversities are not of equal importance to the store where I was one of four Hispanic employees. I am Puerto Rican and Irish and French and Polish and all these backgrounds have allowed me to see unique perspectives, but they are not a single definition of me. I am a daughter, a student, a friend, a sister. I am everything I love and every book I've read and all the people I've helped and all the places I've traveled. I am all of my passions and the closed minds I intend on opening and the thirst for life I intend on quenching. I have grown up with a feeling of exclusion from both sides of my heritage, yet in the process of fighting for a sense of belonging I have embraced myself for more than the color of my skin or the accent of my father. My identity is so much more than an uncomfortable glance from a person who can't place my nose with a nation. I am more than a prejudice comment. What I have truly come to understand by living at the intersection of two very different situations is how ignorance develops so easily from not being able to empathize. My white uncle will never know what it is like to be a minority. He will never feel the stares I have felt, he will never be called a spic, he will never be disadvantaged for his light complexion. It is only when people place themselves as close as possible to the reality of others do they begin to rid themselves of the subconscious prejudices our society places upon us.",1,2.711867028,2.943857052,3.159718609,3.484449028,3.080652123,14.0,22.4,28.2,31.8,25.0
C0,38,"As a Puerto Rican, Irish, French, and Polish individual, I am a walking representation of cultural diversity. Growing up, I felt the weight of my heritage on my shoulders. Each family gathering was a melting pot of customs, languages, and beliefs that reflected my ancestors' backgrounds. It wasn't until I was older that I realized how being a multicultural individual has given me a unique perspective on the world and my place in it. Being Puerto Rican has allowed me to embrace my Hispanic roots and the importance of family. From the moment I was born, I was surrounded by warmth and love from my extended family. We gathered regularly to enjoy traditional dishes like arroz con gandules and pasteles. We danced to salsa music and cheered for our favorite baseball team, the Puerto Rican National Team. These experiences have instilled in me the value of community and the importance of maintaining cultural traditions. Growing up, I also became aware of the negative stereotypes associated with being Hispanic. As a child, I was often teased for my curly hair and accent. But instead of letting those comments discourage me, I used them as motivation to prove that being Puerto Rican is something to be proud of. I embraced my culture and found strength in it, even when it wasn't the popular thing to do. On the other hand, being Irish has taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. My paternal grandfather immigrated to the United States from Ireland in search of a better life for himself and his family. He worked tirelessly as a laborer, often taking on multiple jobs to make ends meet. His dedication and determination have inspired me to work hard and never give up on my goals. Being Irish also means being a part of a rich literary tradition. I grew up hearing stories of Yeats, Joyce, and Wilde. Their works taught me the power of language and the ability to express oneself through words. As a result, I developed a love for writing and have used it as a way to connect with others and share my experiences. My French heritage has given me an appreciation for the arts and the beauty of life. My maternal grandmother, who is French, introduced me to the works of Monet and Renoir. She taught me the importance of slowing down and enjoying the simple things in life, like a freshly baked croissant or a walk through a garden. Being French has also taught me the importance of language and communication. I have studied French for several years and have found that speaking another language has allowed me to connect with people from different backgrounds and cultures. It has given me a deeper understanding of the world and the people in it. Finally, being Polish has taught me the importance of resilience and adaptability. My great-grandparents immigrated to the United States from Poland and faced numerous challenges as they tried to establish themselves in a new country. Their stories of hardship and perseverance have taught me to be resilient in the face of adversity and to adapt to new situations. Being Polish has also given me a strong sense of community and the importance of giving back. I have volunteered at a local Polish festival for several years, helping to organize events and connect with members of the community. Through these experiences, I have learned the value of service and the impact that one person can have on a community. As a multicultural individual, I have had the privilege of experiencing different cultures and learning from them. Each heritage has given me something unique that has shaped my identity and my perspective on the world.

Being French has given me an appreciation for the arts and the beauty of life. My maternal grandmother, who is French, introduced me to the works of Monet and Renoir. She taught me the importance of slowing down and enjoying the simple things in life, like a freshly baked croissant or a walk through a garden. Finally, being Polish has taught me the importance of resilience and adaptability. My great-grandparents immigrated to the United States from Poland and faced numerous challenges as they tried to establish themselves in a new country. Their stories of hardship and perseverance have taught me to be resilient in the face of adversity and to adapt to new situations. But with these backgrounds also comes a sense of exclusion and discomfort. I have felt the weight of my heritage on my shoulders and have struggled to find a sense of belonging. At Thanksgiving gatherings, I would feel displaced among my blue-eyed and freckled cousins, trying to sound and act 'white' to fit in. Yet, it is through this struggle that I have come to understand how ignorance develops so easily from not being able to empathize. My white uncle will never know what it is like to be a minority. He will never feel the stares I have felt, he will never be called a spic, he will never be disadvantaged for his light complexion. It is only when people place themselves as close as possible to the reality of others do they begin to rid themselves of the subconscious prejudices our society places upon us. In conclusion, my multicultural background has given me a unique perspective on the world and has shaped who I am today. It has taught me the importance of family, hard work, beauty, and resilience. But with this identity also comes a sense of exclusion and discomfort that I have had to navigate.

C2,40,"Growing up as a multicultural individual has been a defining aspect of my identity. Being Puerto Rican, Irish, French, and Polish has given me a unique perspective on the world and has shaped who I am today. But with this identity comes a sense of exclusion and discomfort that I have had to navigate. It wasn't until I was seven years old that I became aware of the ignorance and intolerance that surrounds my identity. My French and Irish uncle, looking into my brown eyes, proclaimed that his son's lack of an AP English book was more important than the life and well-being of a child that looks like me. It was in that moment that I realized how easily ignorance can develop from not being able to empathize. As I grew older, I became more aware of the negative stereotypes associated with being Puerto Rican. At family gatherings, the sound of salsa music and the smell of arroz con gandules filled the air. My Abuela's house was where my Puerto Rican cousins flourished, speaking fluent Spanish and shaking their heads when I asked what they were saying. They would tease me for my lack of Spanish skills and call me a 'gringa' as I struggled to keep up. But instead of letting those comments discourage me, I used them as motivation to prove that being Puerto Rican is something to be proud of. I embraced my culture and found strength in it, even when it wasn't the popular thing to do. I remember the texture of my Abuela's pasteles, made with love and care. The vibrant colors of Puerto Rican flags that adorned our family's homes, a symbol of pride in our heritage.Similarly, my Irish heritage has taught me the value of hard work and perseverance. My paternal grandfather immigrated to the United States from Ireland in search of a better life for himself and his family. He worked tirelessly as a laborer, often taking on multiple jobs to make ends meet. His dedication and determination have inspired me to work hard and never give up on my goals. I remember the sound of his voice, thick with the Irish accent that he never lost. The smell of the corned beef and cabbage that he would cook for St. Patrick's Day, a reminder of his roots. But it was his actions that spoke louder than words. He was a man who never gave up, even in the face of adversity. When my family faced financial struggles, he was the first to offer his help, working extra hours to provide for us. Being French has given me an appreciation for the arts and the beauty of life. My maternal grandmother, who is French, introduced me to the works of Monet and Renoir. She taught me the importance of slowing down and enjoying the simple things in life, like a freshly baked croissant or a walk through a garden. I remember the smell of fresh baguettes that filled her home, the taste of the macarons that she would bring to family gatherings. But it was the symbolism of her love for art that impacted me the most. She would take me to art museums and show me the beauty in the world. She taught me that life is not just about survival, but also about finding beauty in the everyday. Finally, being Polish has taught me the importance of resilience and adaptability.

H,41,"At this point in my life, I am used to the chuckles I receive upon telling my friends that I, in fact, love Legos. Growing up in a house of four children was a hectic environment to say the least; an escape from the chaos of siblings was much needed. As a kid, sitting down and concentrating on one task was never my intention, rather I was constantly energetic, chasing and being chased by my siblings. Building Lego sets had always been a way to minimize any stressors that were going on at the time, or to simply relax and enjoy the challenge. My first Lego set was given to me at a very young age, my seventh birthday, and although excited, I was puzzled with what I was supposed to accomplish. I knew that Luke Skywalker was going to need a little more assistance than I could offer at that age, so after countless hours of struggling and persisting, I inevitably succumbed to the numerous offers of help. Each birthday and holiday moving forward, I requested Legos in order to perfect my ability, and each time I gained expertise. Finally, I encountered my own “Eureka!” moment, individually completing my first kit, a miniature replica of the Seattle Space Needle, solely on willpower and sheer excitement. My worn, but comfortable bedroom floor had become my safe haven for letting my mind wander and to create sculptures I would have never thought of if it hadn’t been for my obsession with those miniscule, plastic blocks. I hadn’t usually been the most creative, artistic person; however, when I sat down in my room next to my collection and freed my mind, I suddenly become an artist of my own definition. Soon, as I got older, more unique ideas for pieces flooded my mind rather than following strict instructions. These ideas had resulted in the possibility of designing and constructing certain buildings and entities, of course without any real-world consequences. My bedroom floor eventually turned into a skyline resembling that of New York City, skyscrapers grazing the top of my bed and Rockefeller Center spanning from my desk to my closet. Arriving home late from school or a strenuous practice, I was relieved to lay down next to my meaningful, personalized city. I rarely construct Lego structures nowadays; however, my obsession with those tiny bricks embedded a passion in me that will never cease to follow me. Arriving to a boarding school as a first-year student, I was extremely hesitant and nervous. Though I would soon be a part of a team, I sought an escape from my anxiety of being away from home and especially my bedroom. Though I hadn’t brought along any of my Legos, (I’m sure you can imagine why), I signed up for a new class which taught the basics of ceramics and sculpting figures. Ceramics was an entire new entity to me and I enjoyed every second of it. I had been constructing simple bowls and plates to ease myself into the new medium I was using. Soon, however, I became more confident and adventurous with my designs. After hours in the studio at school, I ultimately transferred my projects back to my personal studio, my bedroom, to join the company of my surrounding Lego projects. Not only providing me with entertainment, Legos left an everlasting mark on my capacity to experiment with new endeavors I would rarely attempt. Legos hold a special place in my mind and my heart due to the effect they have had on my curiosity, creativity and overall optimism. I will continue to design my sculptures, my essays, and my future, which is certainly guided by my imagination. Having constructed those guided, age appropriate sets and eventually designing unique pieces, I developed a knack for sculpting and imagining brand new ideas I transfer into my everyday life.",1,2.963627939,3.193969862,3.271500421,3.698372421,3.250200988,19.0,24.0,26.0,29.0,25.5
C0,42,"As I sit on the floor, surrounded by a sea of colorful bricks, I can't help but feel a sense of calm wash over me. It's a feeling that I've grown to love and appreciate over the years, and it all started with a small Lego set I received as a gift when I was six years old. For many people, Lego is simply a toy - something to play with for a few hours before losing interest and moving onto the next thing. But for me, Lego has become so much more than that. It's a passion, a hobby, and a way of life. At its core, Lego is all about creativity and imagination. With just a few bricks, you can create anything your mind can dream up. I've spent countless hours building everything from castles and spaceships to robots and dragons. Each time I start a new project, I'm filled with excitement and anticipation for what I'll be able to create. But Lego is more than just a creative outlet for me. It's also a way to connect with others who share my passion. I've spent countless hours at Lego conventions and meetups, meeting other Lego enthusiasts from all over the world. It's amazing to see how people from different backgrounds and cultures can come together and bond over a common love for plastic bricks. One of the things I love most about Lego is how it teaches you to be patient and persistent. Building a complex Lego set can take hours, or even days, but the sense of accomplishment you feel when you finally finish it is incredible. You learn to take your time, follow instructions carefully, and not give up when things get difficult. These are all valuable skills that translate into other areas of life. But perhaps what I love most about Lego is how it allows me to escape from the stresses and pressures of everyday life. When I'm building, I'm completely focused on the task at hand, and all my worries and anxieties fade away. It's a form of meditation for me, a way to clear my mind and find peace in the midst of chaos. As I prepare to leave high school and embark on the next chapter of my life, I know that Lego will always be a part of who I am. It's taught me so much about creativity, patience, and perseverance, and has given me a sense of community and connection that I never could have imagined. In a world where it's easy to get caught up in the rush and chaos of everyday life, Lego reminds me to slow down, take a deep breath, and enjoy the simple pleasures. It's a reminder that sometimes, the most important things in life are the ones that bring us joy and peace. So yes, I love Lego. I love the way it makes me feel, the way it challenges me, and the way it connects me with others who share my passion. And as I move forward into the next phase of my life, I know that my love for Lego will continue to be a guiding force, reminding me to always stay true to who I am and what I love.",0,2.340744123,2.624908065,2.918069736,3.158784501,2.695115993,12.0,18.4,22.2,25.8,20.0

It has taught me valuable skills like patience, perseverance, and the importance of following instructions. It has also taught me to let my imagination run wild and to express myself creatively. When I arrived at boarding school as a first-year student, I was nervous and anxious about being away from home. But I found comfort in exploring new mediums, like ceramics, which allowed me to express myself creatively in a different way. And when I was done in the studio, I always returned to my room, where my Lego creations reminded me of my love for creativity and design. Looking back, Legos have had a profound impact on my life. They have taught me the value of persistence, the importance of creativity, and the power of imagination. And while my Lego building days may be behind me, the skills and lessons I've learned from them will stay with me for the rest of my life. As I move forward into the next chapter of my life, I know that my love for Legos will continue to guide me. It has taught me to think outside the box and to embrace my creativity, even when it seems unconventional.

C2,44,"The soft thud of plastic blocks falling onto the hardwood floor echoed throughout the room as I reached for the pile of colorful Legos in front of me. Each brick was smooth to the touch, cool against my fingertips as I began to sort them by color and size. The process of organizing my materials was as important as the building itself, and I relished the calm, methodical pace of it. Lego building had always been a way to escape the chaos of daily life, a way to channel my creativity and imagination into something tangible. I remember receiving my first Lego set at the age of seven, a small box with a picture of a spaceship on the front. I eagerly tore into the package, the crinkling of the wrapping paper a symphony to my young ears. As I poured the blocks onto the floor, a rainbow of colors spread out before me. The scent of new plastic filled my nostrils, and I could feel the texture of the bricks against my skin as I sorted them into piles. The set included a booklet of instructions, which I eagerly flipped through, studying the diagrams and imagining what the finished product would look like. Building the spaceship was a process of trial and error. I made mistakes, struggled to fit certain pieces together, and occasionally had to disassemble parts of my creation to start over. But with each failure came a lesson learned, and I grew more confident in my ability to design and build as I progressed. Over time, my Lego building evolved beyond following instructions. I started to use my imagination, designing buildings and vehicles from scratch. Each project was a new challenge, a new opportunity to push the limits of what I could create. The process of building was therapeutic, a way to escape the stresses of daily life and focus on a task that brought me joy. The sound of Lego bricks clicking together was like music to my ears, and the feeling of satisfaction when I finished a project was like nothing else. But beyond the physical act of building, Lego had a deeper impact on me. It taught me the value of perseverance, patience, and creativity. I learned to approach problems from different angles, to experiment with new ideas, and to never give up even when the solution wasn't immediately clear. One of the most meaningful aspects of Lego building was the sense of community it fostered. I attended Lego conventions and meetups, where I met other enthusiasts from all walks of life. We shared our creations, swapped building techniques, and formed lasting connections based on our shared love of the hobby. As I prepare to move on to the next phase of my life, I know that my love for Lego will stay with me.

H,45,"Had I written this essay three years ago, I would have written with utmost passion about my desire to be a cardiologist. I would have shared that cardiology had lifted the veil placed on my eyes to blind me from my true essence - saving lives. I would have continued to share that it exhibited two of my most accented strengths: my attention to detail and my ability to value each person if though their soul was a reflection of my own. However, most importantly, I felt it was my destiny to grant others what my mother’s cardiologist had granted her: a healthier and rejuvenated life. It is three years later and I do not have a desire to be a cardiologist. The dream I had for cardiology was solely a fabrication of what I believed to be most just. I have a way with words, and I am lyrical. My sweet symphonies are the essence of my being, yet I am not an aspiring songwriter nor am I an aspiring musician. I am a writer. With each word I craft, a part of my soul lives on beyond my years. It turns out that the magic of my words was so powerful, my soul had been deceived. For years, I had been writing about cardiology and science as though the letters c-a-r-d-i-o-l-o-g-y were coursing through my blood, and were tattooed to my heart. Dreams consisted of me writing novels of my career as a cardiologist, sharing my encounters and experience of being a cardiologist. My love for writing had become so pronounced that the passion I had been composing with was mistaken as a passion for cardiology. As a child, I never acknowledged writing as anything more than a hobby. When I would put pen to paper I would solely describe it as just writing. It was never just writing. It was my life; it is who I am. Despite my undying love for this artform, I would tell myself that cardiology was what I wanted, even with the distance and disconnect I felt with cardiology. Regardless of how scholarly and recognized cardiology is, I had felt as though I was settling. However, that all changed. It was a single sentence that unlocked the volta of my life’s story: If you do something you love, you never have to work a day in your life. This sentence, which I heard from an advisor, redirected my thoughts from who I was to who I wanted to be. It was in that moment that my initial thought was not of cardiology, it was of an image of life beyond its limits and a world of wonders, pen to paper, and the flight of young Lorena’s dreams. It was an image of writing. I had always feared that no one would understand my love for writing, nor the bond I had formed with writing. When speaking with a person who does not possess my same passion, it’s as though our conversation is not a conversation at all, but rather a sharing of different languages. They cannot grasp the idea that writing is not solely descriptive language, it is not “red, yellow, blue,” as my aunt would describe it. Writing is the core of my being. It is engraved in my soul. Without it, I would not exist. Writing could never restrain me, because the one thing it offers me that nothing else in the world ever could was the ability to not only think however I wanted to think, but to also be whatever I wanted to be. I had begun a story I had praised for ten years of my life; it was a story I thought I knew the words to like the back of my hand, but the words had drifted and my dream of cardiology had become blurred by my true love and destiny - becoming a writer.",1,2.056693005,2.596597303,2.911999433,3.219337765,2.834220331,7.8,16.0,22.0,26.6,21.0
C0,46,"When I was young, I had it all figured out. I was going to be a cardiologist, just like my dad. I loved hearing about his long days in the hospital, the thrill of saving lives, and the intellectual challenge of diagnosing complex heart conditions. It all sounded perfect to me. But then something happened. I discovered writing. It started innocently enough. I wrote a poem for English class that my teacher praised. I started jotting down my thoughts and feelings in a journal. I even started writing short stories in my free time. It was just a hobby at first, but then something shifted. I realized that writing was more than just a fun pastime. It was a way of understanding the world around me and expressing myself in a way that felt authentic and true. As I delved deeper into the world of writing, I found myself becoming more and more enamored with the idea of pursuing it as a career. I began reading more books, attending writing workshops, and even submitting my work to literary magazines. It was a far cry from the medical textbooks and stethoscopes that had once been my passion. At first, I felt guilty about this shift in my interests. I felt like I was letting my dad down, like I was abandoning the path he had set out for me. But the more I explored my love of writing, the more I realized that it wasn't a rejection of my dad's passion, but a pursuit of my own. I realized that I could be just as fulfilled and passionate about writing as he was about cardiology. It was a revelation, but it wasn't an easy one to come to terms with. I had always been praised for my academic achievements, and the idea of pursuing a creative field like writing felt risky and uncertain. But the more I learned about the writing industry and the opportunities that were available, the more I realized that it was a viable career path. And more importantly, it was one that spoke to my soul in a way that medicine never could. I've come to believe that writing is just as important as any other profession. The stories we tell and the way we tell them shape the world around us, just as much as the doctors and scientists who make groundbreaking discoveries. Writing has the power to inspire, to heal, to challenge, and to connect. It's a form of expression that is uniquely human, and I feel lucky to have found it. Of course, pursuing a career in writing is not without its challenges. There are no guarantees of success, and it can be a lonely and isolating pursuit. But I'm ready to take on those challenges, to hone my craft, and to make a name for myself in the writing world. So why do I want to be a writer instead of a cardiologist? It's simple: because writing speaks to me in a way that medicine never could. Writing allows me to explore the human experience in all its complexity and nuance. It allows me to empathize with people from all walks of life and to tell stories that might not otherwise be heard. Ultimately, I believe that being a writer is about more than just pursuing a personal passion. It's about using that passion to make a positive impact on the world around me. Whether it's through telling stories that shed light on social issues, or inspiring others to pursue their own creative passions, I know that writing has the power to change lives. In the end, I don't regret my change of heart. I'm grateful for the experiences that led me to discover my love of writing, and I'm excited for the journey ahead.

C2,48,"When I was younger, I dreamed of becoming a cardiologist just like my dad. I was fascinated by the intricate workings of the human heart, and the idea of saving lives in the operating room seemed like the noblest pursuit. But then I discovered writing, and it changed everything. The first time I wrote something truly meaningful was in my English class. I remember the feeling of the pen in my hand, the scratch of the paper as I wrote, and the words coming together to form something beautiful. It was like I had discovered a new world, one where I could create something out of nothing. As I continued to write, I realized that it wasn't just about the act of putting pen to paper. It was about the way writing made me feel, the way it allowed me to explore the world in a way that felt uniquely mine. I loved the feeling of being transported to a different time and place, of experiencing new sensations through the characters I created. The more I wrote, the more I began to realize that writing was my true passion. I felt a deep connection to the art form, as if it were a part of my very being. I loved the way words could be strung together to create something that was both beautiful and meaningful. One of the most vivid memories I have of writing was during a particularly hot summer day. I was sitting on the porch with a notebook in my lap, the sun beating down on me as I wrote. I could feel the sweat trickling down my back, the pages of my notebook sticking to my fingers. But even as the heat threatened to overwhelm me, I couldn't stop writing. It was like the words were pouring out of me, like I was tapping into some deep well of creativity that I never knew existed. As I continued to pursue my love of writing, I found that it wasn't always an easy path. There were times when I doubted myself, times when I felt like I would never be able to create something truly great. But even in those moments of doubt, I knew that writing was where I belonged. It was my calling, my destiny. One of the most powerful things about writing is its ability to connect people. Through my writing, I have been able to share my experiences with others, to bring people together in a way that is truly unique. I remember one time when I wrote a short story about a girl who had lost her father. The story was deeply personal to me, and I was hesitant to share it with anyone. But when I finally mustered up the courage to show it to my friends, I was amazed by their response. They were moved by the story, touched by its raw emotion and honesty.

H,49,"The air thickened with red dust as I walked into the basement of Washington Studio School for my first sculpting class - a way to be creative after a stressful day. As I pulled back a thick curtain to enter, I looked around the room, examining the surfaces, all covered in a thin layer of that same dust. The bookshelves behind me were sporting a small collection of sculptures. We were given a 4’ by 6’ block of clay to mold into a woman that was sitting in front of us. I stared at the block of clay, unable to imagine how to start. The woman next to me immediately started shaping her rust-colored slab. She took clumps from the bottom of the piece, adding it to the top, taking pieces away to form shoulders and arms. I spent more than an appropriate amount of time watching her work. I was amazed by the way she could see the woman inside her block of clay. I turned back to my sculpture and gingerly shaved off a piece of clay from the top corner. I continued to work at that corner and that corner only as my instructor travelled around the room, visiting each of his students to offer tips and suggestions. When he made it to my table, he glanced at my piece. I had transformed the 4’ by 6’ rectangular prism into a pentagonal prism. He took one of my tools and started shaving away clay and suggested that I remove even more. He continued to visit the rest of his students as I continued to shave miniscule pieces of clay off of my now hexagonal prism. I wanted to act on his advice, I wanted to take this opportunity to learn, but I did not want to do something wrong. I was afraid of the permanence of my choices. This fear continued to hold me back throughout the 3-hour lesson. By the end of the class, rather than my piece looking like the model sitting in front of me, my piece looked like Mario from the 1985 Super Mario Bros. I left the class, wondering when I started letting fear control my actions. I remembered that I used to quite literally jump into new situations. The first time I went on a chair lift, for example, I had been so excited to “hit the slopes” that instead of waiting for the chair lift to reach the end, I leaped off 8 feet too soon. Luckily, my dad caught me and held onto me until we reached the end of the lift. The next week, I was determined to reclaim that feeling of fearlessness to make progress on my sculpture. This time, I took out clumps, rather than slithers. When my instructor reached my table, he pointed to plenty of problems with my piece. The arm was too high, the legs looked like a yeti’s, and the head took the shape of a balloon. But I realized that at least I was doing it — and I was enjoying it, too. My final piece was in no way a replica of the model who sat in front of me during those lessons: it was riddled with errors. But, while the person I was when I first entered the classroom may have hated the fact that she could see all the mistakes in her final structure, I now appreciate that I can see them, and that I can see how far I’ve come since making them. No matter how deep under the surface of my sculpture the mistake might be, I know it is there. Every crack, air bubble, slip and score, is a working component in my sculpture. And I know that, like my sculpture, I’ve been shaped by my mistakes, too: as long as I want to keep becoming myself, I’ll need to keep making them.",1,2.42937019,2.711202498,2.907153754,3.136783632,2.788446347,12.0,15.8,19.2,26.6,18.0
C0,50,"As I sat at my desk, staring at the lump of clay in front of me, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nervous excitement. I had always been interested in art, but this was my first time attempting to create something with my own hands. The blank canvas of the clay seemed to taunt me, daring me to take on the challenge of molding it into something beautiful. I began by pressing my fingers into the clay, feeling the cool, pliable material squish and shift under my touch. It was a strange sensation, one that I found both exhilarating and intimidating. But as I worked, I began to lose myself in the process, feeling the clay take shape under my hands as if it had a life of its own. For hours, I toiled away, refining the curves and edges of my sculpture, coaxing it into existence. And as I worked, I couldn't help but notice the parallels between my creation and my own journey through high school. In many ways, building a clay sculpture is a lot like building a life. You start with a raw, unformed material, and it's up to you to shape it into something that reflects who you are and what you want to accomplish. And just like with a sculpture, the process of building a life is rarely straightforward or easy. At times, you'll find yourself pushing too hard, trying to force your creation to bend to your will. Other times, you'll hesitate, unsure of how to proceed, afraid of making a mistake. But if you keep working, keep pushing, keep trying new things, eventually you'll find yourself with something that you can be proud of. As I molded the clay into the shape of my sculpture, I found myself thinking about the challenges I'd faced over the past four years. There were times when I'd been overwhelmed by the pressure of school, times when I'd felt like I wasn't good enough, smart enough, or talented enough to succeed. But as I worked on my sculpture, I realized that those challenges had been the raw material of my own journey, just as the lump of clay was the raw material of my creation. Each time I'd faced a setback, I'd been given an opportunity to learn and grow, to shape myself into the person I wanted to be. And just like with my sculpture, the process of building a life isn't just about shaping yourself. It's also about letting yourself be shaped by the world around you. As I worked, I found myself drawing inspiration from the shapes and textures of the world around me, from the way light fell on a tree outside my window, to the way shadows shifted across my desk. In the same way, I'd been shaped by the people and experiences that had touched my life, from my teachers and mentors, to my friends and family. Each one had left their mark on me, shaping me into the person I am today. As I put the finishing touches on my sculpture, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment that I'd never experienced before. It wasn't just the satisfaction of having created something with my own hands, but the realization that I had the power to shape my own life in the same way. Building a clay sculpture had taught me that the process of creating something beautiful takes time, patience, and a willingness to learn and adapt. But it had also taught me that the raw materials of life—our challenges, our setbacks, our joys and triumphs—are what give our creations depth and meaning. As I submitted my college applications, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement at the thought of what lay ahead. Just like with my sculpture, I knew that the road ahead wouldn't be easy, but I also knew that I had the skills and determination to shape my own future ",0,2.579355318,2.758125022,3.003673976,3.230613445,2.942334805,17.0,21.2,24.8,28.0,23.0
C1,51,"As I stepped into the art studio for my first sculpture class, I felt a mix of excitement and apprehension. The room was filled with the unmistakable scent of clay, and I couldn't help but feel a thrill of anticipation at the thought of molding it into something beautiful. I had always been interested in art, but this was my first time attempting to create something with my own hands. The instructor handed me a block of clay and asked me to create a sculpture of my choice. As I stared at the lump of clay in front of me, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the possibilities. But as I watched the woman next to me begin to shape her own piece, I was struck by the way she seemed to see the sculpture inside the clay. She added and subtracted pieces with confidence and precision, creating a beautiful figure in a matter of hours. I, on the other hand, was hesitant to start. I feared making mistakes, worried that my lack of experience would lead to an unrecognizable mess. I started slowly, adding and subtracting tiny pieces of clay from the block, afraid to commit to any one shape or form. My instructor offered suggestions, but I was too nervous to take them, afraid that I would ruin what little progress I had made. By the end of the class, my sculpture was barely recognizable as anything other than a lumpy mass of clay. I left the studio feeling frustrated and disappointed in myself. I had always been a high-achiever, but in this new endeavor, I felt like a failure. The next week, I decided to approach the sculpture with a new mindset. I reminded myself that mistakes were a natural part of the creative process, and that I needed to embrace them if I wanted to make progress. I took larger clumps of clay and started to shape my sculpture with more confidence. When my instructor came around to check on my progress, he pointed out the areas that needed work, but I didn't feel discouraged. I knew that my mistakes were simply opportunities to learn and grow. As I continued to work on the sculpture over the coming weeks, I began to see it as a reflection of my own journey through high school. Just like with the clay, I had started out feeling hesitant and unsure, afraid to take risks or make mistakes. But over time, I had learned to embrace the challenges that came my way, using them as opportunities to learn and grow. I found that the process of building a clay sculpture was a metaphor for building a life. Both require patience, perseverance, and a willingness to take risks and make mistakes. Both offer opportunities to learn and grow, to shape ourselves into the people we want to become. When I finally finished my sculpture, I was proud of what I had accomplished. It wasn't perfect, but it was a reflection of my journey. The cracks and imperfections were reminders of the challenges I had faced, and the mistakes I had made along the way. But they were also reminders of how far I had come, and the progress I had made. As I submitted my college applications, I thought back to that first day in the sculpture studio. I realized that the lessons I had learned there had prepared me for the challenges that lay ahead. I knew that I would encounter obstacles and setbacks, but I also knew that I had the skills and determination to overcome them. Building a clay sculpture had taught me that mistakes were not failures, but opportunities to learn and grow. It had taught me that the process of creating something beautiful takes time, patience, and a willingness to take risks.

C2,52,"As I walked into the dimly lit basement of the art studio, the pungent smell of clay and the sound of soft music filled my senses. I could see rows of tables, each adorned with small piles of sculpting tools and blocks of clay, like miniature landscapes waiting to be shaped. My instructor handed me a block of clay and asked me to create a sculpture of my choice. As I ran my fingers over the smooth, cool surface of the clay, I couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder at the possibilities. The woman next to me started to mold her clay, adding and subtracting pieces with ease. Her hands moved with a fluidity that was almost hypnotic. I watched her in awe, amazed at the way she seemed to see the sculpture inside the clay. I, on the other hand, was hesitant to start. I felt like I was standing at the edge of a precipice, afraid to take that first step into the unknown. My hands shook as I picked up my sculpting tools, unsure of what to do next. As I worked, I could feel the clay changing beneath my fingertips, shifting and molding into something new. I was amazed at the way the clay seemed to have a life of its own, responding to my touch with an almost tactile awareness. As the hours passed, I lost track of time, lost in the process of creation. The world around me faded away, replaced by the texture of the clay, the sound of my tools, and the smell of the studio. It was a world of its own, one that was both familiar and strange, comforting and exhilarating. Over the coming weeks, I continued to work on my sculpture, refining the curves and edges, adding depth and texture. I was learning to see the sculpture inside the clay, just like the woman next to me had done on that first day. It was a process of discovery, of learning to trust my own instincts, and of allowing myself to make mistakes and learn from them. As I worked, I realized that the sculpture was a metaphor for my own journey through high school. Just like with the clay, I had started out feeling hesitant and unsure, afraid to take risks or make mistakes. But over time, I had learned to embrace the challenges that came my way, using them as opportunities to learn and grow. The sculpture was a reflection of that journey, a testament to the power of perseverance and the importance of taking risks. It was imperfect, with cracks and imperfections, but those imperfections were a reminder of the journey I had taken, and the progress I had made. In the end, the sculpture was more than just a physical creation. It was a symbol of the process of self-discovery, of learning to trust myself, and of the power of the creative process to shape our lives. As I submitted my college applications, I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment at what I had achieved. I knew that I had the skills and determination to shape my own future, just like I had shaped the sculpture from that lump of clay. In many ways, building a clay sculpture was a journey of self-discovery, of learning to trust myself and to take risks. It was a process of learning to see the world in a different way, of discovering the power of creativity to shape our lives. And in the end, it was a testament to the importance of perseverance, of the ability to keep pushing forward, even in the face of obstacles and setbacks. As I look back on my experience in the sculpture studio, I realize that it was more than just a class.

H,53,"Like most teenagers, I am expected to do household chores I would rather avoid. I do my share of feeding the dogs and mowing the lawn, but growing up in a two hundred and thirty-four-year-old tavern has meant that my experiences and responsibilities go well beyond the usual fare—like when I discovered my cats meowing and leaping at two chimney swifts that had fallen down the fireplace and were frantically circling my room. Once, during a Nor’Easter, I woke up to find that snow was blowing through the seams of the house’s original window panes. I swept up the little, swirling drifts on my bedroom floor, taped up the windows, and went back to bed. It was in times like these that I was just a bit envious of my friends’ newer, weathertight homes, but deep inside, I knew I would not trade sleeping in extra layers in my quirky, old Harvard, Massachusetts home for any other place. Since my parents bought it as a fixer-upper, I am often recruited to work on projects like glazing windows, spackling sheetrock, and painting rooms. This past summer, I begrudgingly agreed to help repair the mortar joints in the fieldstone foundation of our basement. I hauled an eighty-pound bag of cement and mixed it with water into a peanut butter-like consistency. I grabbed a gob from the wheelbarrow and got to work stuffing it into the deep crevices between the jumble of stones, troweling it smooth and brushing it to create a finished texture. The hours spent working, much of it on my hands and knees, gave me a lot of time for self-reflection. Undisturbed by text messages or buzzing FaceTime requests, I allowed my mind to wander to the far reaches of my imagination in the quiet solitude of the cellar. Sometimes I reflected on what I should have said in a conversation with a friend, thought through an argument around a current political issue, or pondered ways to frame my essays for summer reading assignments. Working with my hands, I appreciated the art of forming and sculpting the cement into place, realizing that it was just as creative a process as writing, editing and reworking my essays and poems. It was an iterative and tiring process to get it right. Dripping with sweat, the grinding physical effort from having to work quickly before the cement hardened mirrored my exhaustion in a race I had rowed in last year— although the weather conditions had been very different. At the Head of the Fish Regatta, I had rowed for three miles through the cold, driving rain, facing a fifteen miles-per-hour headwind—feeling as if my arms and legs were on fire—in order to finish. Good mortaring requires technical precision, speed and strength. I needed to mix the mortar in the correct proportions; work carefully so I did not miss any gaps; and most of all, I needed to persevere, working until the entire wall was repointed. Eventing requires a similar mastery of multiple skills in order to succeed in the three distinct phases of competition. In dressage, my buckskin horse Eli and I needed to work together as one, in calm precision and balance; in show jumping, we needed the focus and technical skills to count strides and launch at the right moment; and in cross-country, we needed the strength and endurance to gallop several miles over fences, across ditches, and through water obstacles. Whether handling a bucket of wet cement or a green horse, I recognized that having the patience and determination to keep improving despite hardship, tedium or discomfort was essential to reach any mental or physical goal, be it winning a competition, writing an essay or rebuilding a wall. Standing back from the finished fieldstone wall, I basked in the accomplishment—not just of finishing the chore—but of discovering the zen in the art of mortar maintenance.",1,2.778447169,3.133206844,3.445132728,3.559727593,3.32792308,19.0,22.8,33.6,35.8,27.5
C0,54,"As I stood outside my grandfather's brick home, I couldn't help but notice the cracks running through the mortar joints. The house, built over 50 years ago, was showing its age. It was then that I began to realize the importance of repairing mortar joints, not just for the aesthetic value, but for the structural integrity of the building. It was an eye-opening experience that taught me the significance of paying attention to the smallest details. Repairing mortar joints is a meticulous process that requires attention to detail and a certain level of skill. The process involves removing the old, damaged mortar and replacing it with new mortar. The process may seem simple, but it is an essential part of maintaining the structural integrity of any building. However, what I find most interesting about repairing mortar joints is the concept of 'tuckpointing.' Tuckpointing is a technique used to create the illusion of a perfectly uniform joint in a wall made of irregularly shaped stones. The technique involves using two different colors of mortar, one to match the color of the stones and the other to match the color of the joints. The result is a seamless joint that creates an illusion of perfect symmetry. As I delved deeper into the world of repairing mortar joints, I began to appreciate the artistry that goes into the process. It requires a great deal of patience and attention to detail, but the end result is always worth it. Repairing mortar joints not only enhances the appearance of a building but also ensures its structural integrity. In fact, repairing mortar joints is an excellent metaphor for life. Just as repairing mortar joints requires patience, attention to detail, and a steady hand, so does life. It is important to pay attention to the small details, to take the time to do things right, and to be patient in the face of adversity. When we take care of the small things, the larger things fall into place. Moreover, I believe that repairing mortar joints can also teach us about the importance of preserving history. Many older buildings are made of brick or stone and have been standing for generations. However, the ravages of time and neglect can cause these structures to deteriorate, which can result in the loss of our heritage. By repairing mortar joints, we are not only preserving the physical structure of the building but also the history and culture that it represents. This belief was further reinforced when I visited my great-grandfather's ancestral home in a small town in Italy. The house, which had been built over 100 years ago, was in dire need of repair. The mortar joints were crumbling, and the walls were beginning to lean. However, the house still held a significant amount of value for my family as it represented our heritage and history. It was clear that repairing the mortar joints would not only improve the appearance of the house but also preserve its value for future generations. As a high school senior, I have come to appreciate the importance of repairing mortar joints beyond just the technical aspect of the process. It has taught me about the artistry and patience required in any process, the significance of preserving history, and the importance of paying attention to the smallest details. In conclusion, repairing mortar joints is not just a process but an art form that requires patience and attention to detail. It represents a significant part of preserving our cultural heritage and ensuring the structural integrity of our buildings. The process of repairing mortar joints has taught me about the importance of patience, attention to detail, and the significance of preserving history. As I move forward in my life, I will carry these lessons with me and apply them to any task that I undertake.",0,2.680919209,2.866765169,3.105246474,3.265431116,2.983298208,15.0,17.8,20.2,23.6,19.0

C2,56,"The sound of scraping and chipping filled the air as my grandfather worked on repairing the mortar joints of his brick home. I watched in awe as he removed the old, damaged mortar, carefully chiseling it away with his trusty hammer and chisel. The mortar crumbled beneath his skilled hands, revealing the reddish-brown bricks that lay beneath. As I helped mix the new mortar, I couldn't help but notice the smell of freshly mixed cement that filled the air. The pungent odor was mixed with a hint of earthiness, reminding me of the damp soil found in the garden. The texture of the mortar was rough to the touch, gritty and wet, but it held a promise of solidity and stability once it had hardened. While my grandfather worked on the brick home, I would often explore the surrounding landscape, fascinated by the way the stones and rocks appeared to be naturally interwoven. This natural interweaving of materials reminded me of the importance of interconnectedness, both in life and in the art of repairing mortar joints. One day, I noticed a small spider weaving its web in the corner of the window frame. The spider carefully spun its delicate threads, weaving them together to create a strong and sturdy web. This small but mighty spider reminded me of the importance of attention to detail and how the smallest things can make a big impact. As I delved deeper into the world of repairing mortar joints, I began to appreciate the artistry that goes into the process. Each stroke of the trowel was intentional, each piece of mortar carefully placed in its designated spot. The art of repairing mortar joints became a symbol of the beauty and resilience of human creativity. One day, while repairing the mortar joints in the basement, I noticed a small hole in the wall. The hole was no bigger than a dime, but it had been there for years, gradually growing in size. It was a symbol of the gradual wear and tear that comes with time and reminded me of the importance of maintenance and preservation. Repairing mortar joints taught me about the importance of perseverance and determination. It was a tiring and labor-intensive process, but the end result was always worth it. I remembered the time I spent rowing in a race during a Nor'easter, my arms and legs aching as I pushed forward, determined to finish. Repairing mortar joints required the same determination, the same willingness to push through discomfort in pursuit of a goal.

H,57,"Every person who truly knows me believes that I was born in the wrong century. They call me 'an old soul' because I'm a collector, attracted to books, antiques, vinyl records and anything from the 80's. But they also think I am unique in other ways. I believe it is because of the meaningful connections to my two languages and two cultures. When we moved into our first American house, I was excited to decorate my new room. The first thing I knew I needed was a place to organize my most cherished possessions I have collected throughout my life. I searched and finally found a bookshelf with twenty-five thick sections that I could build and organize alphabetically. Now the titanium white paint is starting to peel off from all the years it's been used, but that only makes it more endearing to me. Each shelf holds important objects from different parts of my life. The top row has my books in Portuguese that I brought from Brazil. They were passed down to me by my great-grandma when she died. Most of them are old poetry books and have handwritten notes from her. Some of the pages are falling apart, but the books mean a lot to me. I start to feel heavyhearted as I remember my great-grandma sitting up in her hospital bed, reading her favorite poem to me, even though she was ill. She was the person who planted the love of reading in me. I live by the values she taught me and the biggest section in my collection of books to date is of poetry, both in English and Portuguese. These books are a strong connection to my Brazilian heritage. They also remind me of the time when I was growing up in Brazil, as a member of a large Italian-Brazilian family. We used every excuse to get together and we ate a lot. This is the toughest part of living in another country. Over the years, I had to learn to deal with not being present with my family all the time. And I learned how valuable the time is when we do get together once or twice a year. The second and third row has books that I used to learn English. It has some of my 'classics', like the whole Harry Potter collection. These books have folded pages, handwritten vocabulary definitions and translations in the margins. It brings back great memories from our old apartment in São Paulo, where my older sister read them to me as a bedtime story. I also see books like The Boston Tea Party and Alexander Hamilton, that I read in order to better understand the history of my new country. It was not easy to leave everything behind and move with my family to the US. It was not easy to enter a new school in a new language. But I persevered and when I look back now, I never felt so comfortable in a place like I feel now. This section of my bookshelf reminds me of an important part of my journey. At the bottom of the bookshelf, I have some of my most beloved items. The 1937 Remington typewriter was a gift from my grandfather and is my favorite piece. He gave it to me as I was leaving for the United States. I love the noise it makes when I am typing a letter. I wonder how many countless letters have been written with this typewriter. I use it for special occasions, sometimes writing in Portuguese to my family or in English to my friends. As I grab my favorite Elvis vinyl to play, I can only wonder about the next chapter of my life. I look forward to adding new books, new friends, and a wide variety of experiences to my bookshelf.",1,2.485546822,2.646982263,2.922588833,3.145099348,2.747896468,12.0,13.8,16.4,21.0,15.0
C0,58,"As a child, I was always fascinated by dance. Watching performers glide across the stage with seemingly effortless grace and fluidity captivated me. However, my family could not afford dance lessons, so I turned to the internet for guidance. Specifically, YouTube became my teacher, mentor, and guide in learning how to dance. At first, I was skeptical. How could I learn something as complex as dance from a few videos online? But as I began to watch more and more videos, I discovered a wealth of knowledge and inspiration at my fingertips. I could pause and rewind whenever I needed to, and I could watch the same video over and over again until I got the move right. The more I practiced, the more my skills improved. Before I knew it, I was learning choreography from some of the world's top dancers. One of the most valuable lessons I learned from learning dance through YouTube was the importance of perseverance. It's easy to get discouraged when you don't have a teacher or peers to support you, but I quickly realized that the only person I had to impress was myself. I was the one who had to set goals, practice consistently, and push through the frustration of not getting a move right on the first try. It was a valuable lesson that has carried over into other areas of my life, such as academics and athletics. Another important lesson I learned was the power of community. While I was learning alone in my bedroom, I quickly discovered that I was part of a much larger community of dancers on YouTube. I began to interact with other dancers online, sharing my progress and seeking feedback. Through this community, I found a sense of belonging and support that I didn't know I needed. Even though we were all learning from different parts of the world, we shared a common passion for dance that brought us together. Through YouTube, I also discovered the diversity of dance styles and cultures. I was able to explore everything from classical ballet to hip-hop and Bollywood dance. Each style had its unique challenges, but I relished the opportunity to expand my horizons and learn something new. I discovered that dance was a universal language that transcended borders and cultures. Learning dance through YouTube also taught me the importance of self-expression. As a shy and introverted person, dance allowed me to express myself in ways that I never thought possible. I could convey emotions and tell stories through movement, and it was a liberating experience. I learned to embrace my individuality and use it as a strength in my dancing. Finally, learning dance through YouTube taught me the value of taking risks. While it's easy to stick with what you know, I learned that true growth comes from stepping outside of your comfort zone and trying new things. Whether it was attempting a challenging new move or posting a video of myself dancing for the world to see, I learned to take risks and trust in my abilities. In conclusion, learning dance through YouTube has been a life-changing experience. It has taught me the importance of perseverance, community, diversity, self-expression, and taking risks. It has allowed me to explore my passion for dance in a way that would not have been possible otherwise. And while I may not have had the traditional dance training that many of my peers have had, I am confident that the skills and lessons I have learned through YouTube have prepared me for whatever challenges lie ahead.",0,2.599670046,2.797037894,2.974119863,3.066039165,2.838733719,12.0,14.0,17.8,23.4,15.0
C1,59,"Throughout my childhood, I was constantly dreaming of becoming someone else. I longed to be a dancer, a drummer, a computer scientist – anything but myself. But it wasn't until I discovered the power of YouTube that I was able to turn those dreams into a reality. My journey with YouTube began with simple tasks, like learning how to toast bread correctly. But it was when I stumbled upon a breakdance tutorial that everything changed. I spent hours tirelessly practicing a move that seemed impossible to master. But finally, I did it. The excitement and rush of accomplishment was so powerful that I wanted to continue learning and growing as a dancer. Despite not having the traditional training or resources that many dancers have, I was determined to learn through YouTube. I practiced and experimented with different styles, from contemporary to hip-hop and even Bollywood. Through the online dance community, I found a sense of belonging and support that I didn't know I needed. I was able to connect with other dancers from all around the world who shared the same passion as me. But learning dance through YouTube was not without its challenges. I had to persevere through the frustration of not having a teacher or peers to guide me. I had to push through my insecurities and take risks, putting myself out there on social media to share my progress and seek feedback. Despite the difficulties, I never lost sight of my goal: to show the world that you can make anything out of nothing. When I entered King's as a freshman, I was faced with the challenge of competing against other dancers who had access to tutors, classes, and workshops. But I didn't let that stop me. I worked twice as hard, relying on my passion and drive to succeed. Under the guidance of my dance teacher, Mr. Ryuji Yamaguchi, I was able to experiment with different styles and push my limits. I performed contemporary duets, group pieces, hip-hop solos, and even Bollywood routines. And when it came time for the annual dance concert, I gave it my all. I danced my heart out and completed the show with immense success. But it was when I saw my mother's teary eyes and proud smile that I knew I had truly broken free from the shackles of self-doubt and insecurity. For the first time, I was able to say with pride, 'I created this.' And that feeling of accomplishment and self-expression is something that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. In conclusion, learning dance through YouTube has taught me invaluable lessons about perseverance, community, diversity, self-expression, and taking risks. It has allowed me to turn my dreams into a reality and to prove to myself and others that anything is possible with passion and dedication. I may not have had the traditional training or resources that many dancers have, but I have something even more important: the drive to succeed and the willingness to take risks. And as I continue on my journey as a dancer, I know that I will continue to rely on these qualities to break down barriers and achieve my goals.",0,2.59623144,2.747846221,2.919393305,3.153974418,2.795547603,12.0,15.0,19.4,22.4,18.0
C2,60,"Growing up, I felt confined by my circumstances. I dreamed of being a dancer, but my family couldn't afford to pay for lessons. It wasn't until I discovered the world of YouTube that I realized there was a way to learn and express myself through dance. I remember the first time I attempted to learn a dance routine from a YouTube video. I was sitting in my bedroom, the computer screen casting a bluish glow across the room. As the video began, the music filled the space around me. The beat pulsated through my body, and I felt my heart racing with excitement. I watched the dancer on the screen, studying her movements and trying to mimic them. I stumbled and fell several times, but I refused to give up. I would replay the video again and again, determined to get it right. It wasn't until the wee hours of the morning that I finally mastered the routine. The sense of accomplishment I felt was indescribable. As I continued to learn and grow as a dancer through YouTube, I discovered that the platform offered much more than just instructional videos. It was a place where dancers from all over the world could connect and share their art. I felt like I was part of a community, even though I was sitting alone in my bedroom. One of the most challenging aspects of learning dance through YouTube was the lack of direct feedback. I had to rely on my own instincts and intuition to improve my skills. I learned to trust my body and to be mindful of every movement. I paid attention to the smallest details, like the way my foot arched or the placement of my arm. But as I continued to practice and hone my craft, I began to see progress. I was able to take risks and try new things, like experimenting with different styles of dance. I remember the first time I tried a hip-hop routine. The music was loud and heavy, the beat pounding in my chest. I felt like I was unleashing a new part of myself as I moved across the floor, my body contorting in ways I never thought possible. Through YouTube, I also discovered the power of self-expression. Dance became a way for me to release my emotions and tell my own story. When I danced, I felt like I was speaking a language that everyone could understand, regardless of where they came from or what language they spoke. But perhaps the most significant lesson I learned through dance on YouTube was the importance of resilience. There were times when I felt frustrated and discouraged, like I would never improve. But I refused to give up. I continued to practice and push myself, even when it felt like I was hitting a wall. One particular instance stands out in my memory. I was trying to learn a particularly challenging routine, and I kept getting stuck on one particular move. My body just wouldn't cooperate, and I felt like giving up. But then I thought of all the times I had pushed through difficult moments in my life. I thought of my mother, who had worked tirelessly to provide for our family. I thought of my grandparents, who had fled war and persecution to give us a better life. And suddenly, the move didn't seem so impossible. I pushed through, and when I finally got it right, I felt a surge of pride and accomplishment. Looking back, I realize that dance on YouTube wasn't just a hobby or a pastime. It was a way for me to connect with myself and with the world around me. It taught me the importance of perseverance, community, and self-expression. And most importantly, it showed me that anything is possible if you have the drive and the determination to succeed.",0,2.442557824,2.612945915,2.726345748,2.8619514,2.696230759,11.0,14.0,16.0,17.6,15.0
H,61,"In the dimly lit room, I sat huddled under my lamp as my fingers repeated the rhythmic movements of the needle disappearing and reappearing under the banarsi fabric while I carefully folded its edges, taming the wayward golden threads to patch it over a hole burnt in the citrine mysore silk lehnga (a wide-hemmed skirt). Accentuated with hundreds of golden sequins and zardozi work on its hem, shining whenever it caught the light of the lamp, the eight and a half yards of fabric seemed like a jeweled sea at my feet. Trying to be as quiet as possible, I imagined the joy I'd see in my sister's eyes who had gone to bed a while ago crying her eyes out over a dream dress gone to 'irreparable' disaster the night before Eid. Tying off the final loose thread, I held it up to the light, proud how her lehnga sparkled even more than before and quietly delivered to her room. Salvaging the day for my sister was a risk worth taking. The next morning as my sister fawned over the new design, came the reaction I was bracing for. 'Is this what you were doing all night?' I could hear the disdain in my father's voice, disappointed over his son's 'feminine inclinations'. Something that has always gotten me in trouble with him, from ditching my toy cars to play with Barbie dolls to being too interested in my mother's makeup. 'He's going to become a darzi (tailor) when he grows up!' my friends would snicker at my craftiness with the needle and thread. The pressure of fitting the stereotypical gender roles followed me everywhere - my teachers' snickers at declaring pink my favorite color, my friends' expressions when I talked about facials and manicures, and my mother's horror on spending more time organizing my wardrobe by color than playing in the street. The world that put clear lines between pinks and blues; barbies and hot wheels; being well kempt to manly ruggedness, had me confused. The overwhelming external stimulus was telling me that to fit in and to be accepted I had to hide my true self and mirror what is expected of me. I tried to fit in, suppressing the fragments of interests resurfacing ever so often, to avoid eruption of ridicule. I brushed my passions away like pieces of leftover fabric. Just like that night when restoring my sister's dream brought my thread and needle out; my dreams broke to the surface again standing in front of the school notice board. My gaze fixed on the poster announcing the male modeling competition; I was already choosing between khaki chinos with crisp white Italian slim fit dress shirt paired with a sleek navy blazer or a black skinny necktie. As I filled in the form, I could imagine the field day of sly sarcastic jokes on my effeminate ways. But filling in that form was my catharsis - signing my name was my defiance to carry on a charade to hide my true self. Winning the competition took out some of the sting from the jokes but it wasn't until a sense of liberation set in as the scissors of society's disapproval lost its sharp point. And while my father's disapproval still makes me falter in my tracks but I'd rather have him realize that I can be his son and still be my true self instead of trying to become someone neither of us would recognize in the end. The slightest glimmer in the corner of his eyes as I brought in my awards tells me that my hope is not displaced. So, one after the other I collected stowed away pieces of myself that didn't fit the society's approval and using the thread of resilience I sewed them together for the fabric of my being to become a true reflection of everything I am and aspire to be.",1,2.770340965,3.037312004,3.298477558,3.561077572,3.051076953,13.8,23,28.8,38.6,26.5
C0,62,"As a high school student, my passion for collecting old artifacts has been a constant source of inspiration and learning for me. It started as a hobby, but over time, it has become a way for me to connect with the past, understand the present, and prepare for the future. My fascination with old artifacts began when I was just a child. My grandfather used to take me to antique shops and flea markets, and we would spend hours looking at old coins, stamps, and other items from the past. It was during these visits that I realized that these objects had a story to tell, and that they held a connection to people and events that had long since passed. From that point on, I was hooked. As I grew older, my collection began to expand, and I started to seek out more unique and rare items. I began to attend auctions, estate sales, and other events where I could find items that had a deep history and significance. Some of my favorite pieces include a Civil War-era sword, a letter written by Abraham Lincoln, and a set of antique binoculars used by a World War II soldier. While my collection is certainly unique and interesting, what I have learned through my experiences as a collector is far more important than any individual item. For one, collecting has taught me the value of patience and perseverance. Finding rare and valuable artifacts is not easy, and it often requires a great deal of time and effort. However, the satisfaction of finally adding a new piece to my collection is worth all the effort. In addition, collecting has taught me the importance of research and knowledge. In order to understand the significance of a particular item, I have to spend time researching its history and context. This has given me a deep appreciation for the complexity of the past and the ways in which it shapes our present and future. Perhaps most importantly, collecting has given me a unique perspective on the world. By studying and preserving artifacts from the past, I have come to understand the interconnectedness of human history. I have learned that events that seem distant or disconnected are often part of a larger narrative, and that the actions of individuals can have far-reaching consequences. As a high school student, I believe that my experiences as a collector have given me a unique advantage in preparing for the future. By understanding the complexities of the past, I am better equipped to navigate the challenges of the present and make informed decisions about the future. In addition, my passion for collecting has taught me the value of pursuing what I love, even if it seems unconventional or niche. Ultimately, I believe that my collection is not just a personal hobby, but a reflection of my larger commitment to learning, exploration, and growth. I am excited to continue pursuing my passion for collecting and to see where it takes me in the future. Whether I end up pursuing a career in history, art, or some other field entirely, I know that my experiences as a collector will continue to shape my perspective and influence my decisions. In conclusion, collecting old artifacts has been a defining aspect of my life as a high school student. Through my experiences as a collector, I have learned the value of patience, perseverance, research, and knowledge. I have gained a unique perspective on the world and a deep appreciation for the interconnectedness of human history.

C1,63,"As an individual with a passion for collecting, I have been fortunate enough to experience a connection to the past and present that is truly unique. My collection of old artifacts began when I was a child, and over the years, it has grown to include a variety of interesting and rare items. What started as a hobby has become a way for me to better understand the world and my place in it. My collection has always been a reflection of my interests and experiences. Like the author of the reference essay, I too have a bookshelf that I have organized and curated over the years. Each item on my bookshelf tells a story and represents a piece of my personal history. One of the most significant parts of my collection is a set of antique coins that were passed down to me by my grandfather. These coins are not only valuable in a monetary sense, but they also have a deep connection to my family's history. My grandfather was an avid coin collector himself, and he spent years searching for the perfect coins to add to his collection. When he passed away, he left his collection to me, along with the knowledge and passion for collecting that he had cultivated over the years. In addition to the coins, I also have a collection of old photographs that document important moments in my family's history. These photographs are a reminder of the sacrifices and struggles that my ancestors went through to build a better life for themselves and their families. Looking at these photographs, I feel a deep sense of connection to my family's past, and it inspires me to work hard and continue their legacy. But my collection is not just limited to objects with sentimental value. I also have a passion for collecting historical artifacts that give me a glimpse into the lives of people who came before me. Some of my favorite pieces include a Civil War-era sword, an antique camera from the 1920s, and a set of letters written by soldiers during World War II. These items are not only fascinating in their own right, but they also help me better understand the complexities and challenges of life in the past. What I have learned through my experiences as a collector is that the past is not just something that happened a long time ago. It is something that lives on within us and influences our present and future.

C2,64,"As a high school senior with a passion for collecting old artifacts, I've had the opportunity to connect with the past in a unique and personal way. My collection started as a hobby, but over time, it has become a source of inspiration and learning for me. It has taught me about patience, perseverance, and the interconnectedness of human history. One of my favorite pieces in my collection is a small, ornate music box that belonged to my great-grandmother. It has been passed down through my family for generations, and every time I wind it up and hear the tinkling melody, I am transported back in time. The music box is a symbol of the memories and stories that have been handed down to me, and it represents the deep connection that I feel to my family's history. Another item in my collection is a set of antique binoculars that belonged to a soldier in World War II. When I hold them in my hands, I can feel the weight and texture of the metal, and I imagine what it must have been like for the soldier to use them on the battlefield. The binoculars are a tangible reminder of the sacrifices and struggles that people have gone through in the past, and they inspire me to work hard and persevere in my own life. In addition to these items, I also have a collection of vintage postcards that I have acquired over the years. Each postcard is like a window into a different time and place, and I love studying the intricate details and designs. Some of them feature illustrations of famous landmarks, while others depict scenes from everyday life. They are a reminder that even the smallest moments and experiences can be important and significant in their own way. Perhaps the most meaningful part of my collection, however, is a set of old family photographs. These photographs are like time capsules, frozen moments that capture the essence of a particular time and place. When I look at them, I can see the familiar faces of my ancestors, and I am reminded of the sacrifices and struggles that they went through to build a better life for themselves and their families. The photographs are a reminder of the importance of family, and they inspire me to work hard and be resilient in the face of challenges. I remember one particular photograph of my great-grandfather. In the picture, he is standing in front of a small, rundown shed, wearing a worn-out jacket and a hat that is too big for his head. In the background, I can see a vast expanse of land that stretches out as far as the eye can see. When I asked my grandmother about the photograph, she told me that it was taken during the Great Depression, when times were tough and resources were scarce. She said that my great-grandfather was one of the most resilient people she had ever known, and that he had worked hard to provide for his family, even during the toughest times. The photograph is a symbol of my family's resilience and determination, and it serves as a reminder that even in the face of adversity, we can persevere and overcome. It is a lesson that I have taken to heart in my own life, and it has helped me to stay focused and motivated, even when things get tough.

C0,66,"As a high school senior, I have been thinking a lot about my future career and what I want to do with my life. While many of my peers have their sights set on becoming doctors, lawyers, or engineers, I have a unique aspiration: I want to become a tailor. I realize that this may seem like an unconventional choice, but I believe that it is the perfect career for me. I have always had a passion for fashion, and I love the idea of creating something beautiful and functional from scratch. Additionally, I have a keen eye for detail and enjoy working with my hands, which are both essential skills for a tailor. But my interest in tailoring goes beyond just the technical aspects of the craft. To me, tailoring represents something much deeper: the ability to express oneself through clothing. Growing up, I always felt like I didn't fit in with the mainstream fashion trends. I never felt comfortable wearing the same clothes as everyone else, and I often struggled to find clothes that truly reflected my personality. It wasn't until I discovered tailoring that I realized that I could create my own unique style, one that was tailored specifically to me. In many ways, tailoring is an art form. Just as a painter or sculptor can create something beautiful out of raw materials, a tailor can transform a piece of fabric into a work of art. But unlike other art forms, tailoring is both functional and practical. A well-tailored suit not only looks great, but it also serves a purpose by providing the wearer with a sense of confidence and professionalism. But my interest in tailoring goes beyond just creating beautiful clothing. I am also drawn to the history and tradition of the craft. Tailoring has been around for centuries, and the techniques and skills that were developed long ago are still relevant today. I am fascinated by the idea of carrying on this tradition and passing on these skills to future generations. Of course, I understand that becoming a tailor is not an easy path. It requires years of training and practice, and the industry is highly competitive. But I am willing to put in the work to achieve my goals. I have already started learning the basics of tailoring through online tutorials and have even taken a few classes at a local community college. I am also planning to pursue an apprenticeship with a master tailor to further hone my skills. I believe that my unique perspective on tailoring sets me apart from other applicants. While many people may view tailoring as a niche or outdated profession, I see it as a way to combine my passion for fashion with my desire to express myself and create something beautiful. I believe that tailoring is a field that has the potential to grow and evolve, and I am excited to be a part of that change. In conclusion, I am confident that tailoring is the perfect career for me. It combines my love of fashion, my attention to detail, and my desire to express myself through my clothing. I am willing to put in the time and effort to become a skilled tailor and to carry on the tradition of this timeless craft. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I look forward to the day when I can proudly call myself a tailor.

Tailoring was more than just sewing clothes together; it was a way to express oneself through clothing. Through tailoring, I have been able to reclaim the pieces of myself that I had stowed away for fear of being ridiculed or judged. The thread of resilience has helped me sew together these pieces to create the fabric of my being, a true reflection of everything I am and aspire to be. Tailoring is an art form that allows me to express myself through the clothing that I create. The colors, textures, and patterns that I use all have symbolic significance. The citrine of my sister's lehnga symbolized joy and optimism, while the sequins represented the hope of a brighter future. When I create a garment, I am not just stitching fabric together, but I am also telling a story, one that is unique to each individual. In conclusion, tailoring is more than just a career choice for me; it is a way of life. The precision and attention to detail required in tailoring are skills that translate into all areas of life. Tailoring has taught me to be patient, to persevere through difficulties, and to always strive for excellence. Through tailoring, I have found a way to express myself and to reclaim the pieces of myself that I had stowed away for fear of being judged. I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, and I am ready to put in the work to achieve my goals.",0,2.69439963,2.895466361,2.957651886,3.345580755,2.931231362,15.0,17.2,20.0,26.4,18.0
H,69,"These days, birds are losing the battle of favored domestic animal to dogs and cats. At best, they're an easily forgotten blot in the otherwise clear sky, and at worst, they're nasty pests associated with filth and disease. But for many years, birds were something much greater, the catalyst of folklore and tales for nearly every culture around the world. We've all heard some iteration of a bird story before: Common characters you might recall include the wise owl, mischievous raven, vain peacock, and motherly hen. I was introduced to these stories early on, first captivated by the avian parables I listened to on CDs, and they became an integral part of my early years. I can still remember proudly reciting 'The Ant and the Magpie' word for word to my parents, an important tale reminding listeners to save resources for a time in need, represented by the winter in the animal world. As I got older, my love for birds persisted, but the influence those childlike stories had on me waned. After all, none of my classmates proclaimed their love of dogs stemmed from a Danish fairytale or Chinese folklore. I figured the reason I loved birds was shallower: I enjoyed the startling, colorful plumage and the joyous calls I heard outside my window. No longer were birds a central part of my identity; instead, they became an answer when I had to state my favorite animal during a summer camp icebreaker. It wasn't until I was well into high school, nearly a decade after I last closed the cover, that I found one of my favorite childhood books, 'Why Snails Have Shells,' in the depths of my closet. Rediscovering this book reminded me of the importance I placed on the lessons I learned from the cherished bird characters. Leafing through the pages and rereading the familiar stories, I realized the straightforward teachings of the birds were more relevant to my current life than they ever were in my childhood. Birds once again were not simply my favorite animal, they guided the way I reacted in challenging situations, which - like for most of my peers - came in a barrage as I got older. The lesson that permeates my life today is from an old Chinese proverb, famously summed up by poet Maya Angelou as 'A bird doesn't sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song.' High school life, especially for my generation, is hyper-focused on the approval of others. Instagram is littered with polls asking if outfits are 'ok,' popularity is measured by the average number of comments you get in response to your posts, and every joke uttered is followed by a scan of the room to make sure at least someone is laughing. Contrastingly, the bird doesn't focus on the answer it receives from its song; in fact, it doesn't even expect an answer. The bird sings because it wishes to, because of the joy it experiences when doing so. It can be easy to get swept away in the desire to please, but the personal mantra I've adopted reminds me of the importance of doing things for the sake of making yourself happy, not others. I build relationships I genuinely value, I invest my time in activities I love to do, and I express myself in ways that bring me joy. Although the stories and proverbs I learned when I was younger originated from distant times and places, they have woven themselves into my values and shaped me into the person I am today.",1,2.901960053,3.202903606,3.350273309,3.539456143,3.269340815,19.2,23.4,28.6,35.8,26.0
C0,70,"Birds have always held a special place in my heart. From their graceful flight patterns to their mesmerizing songs, there is something about these creatures that simply captivates me. However, my love for birds goes beyond their aesthetic appeal. It has taught me valuable life lessons and has even influenced my career aspirations. As a child, I spent hours watching birds in my backyard. I would observe their behavior and take notes in my journal. My fascination with them only grew stronger as I got older.

C2,72,"I slowly approached the edge of the river, the sound of rushing water filling my ears. The mist rising off the surface of the water and the chill in the air made it seem as though I had stumbled upon a mystical land. Suddenly, a bird appeared in front of me, diving down into the water and emerging with a fish in its beak. I watched in awe as it flew away, the sunlight reflecting off its wings. Birds have always had a special place in my heart, but it wasn't until I had an experience like this that I truly appreciated their beauty. From that moment on, I began to explore the world of birds more deeply. I joined the birdwatching club in my high school and spent my weekends exploring the nearby parks and forests. One particularly memorable trip was to a nearby marsh, where we watched as a group of egrets elegantly took flight, their wings beating in unison. I was mesmerized by the sound of their wings, the rustling of the reeds, and the distant calls of other birds. It was a symphony of sound that filled me with a sense of peace and calm. Through my experiences with birdwatching, I have come to appreciate the importance of patience and persistence. Watching birds requires a great deal of both, as we must wait for the perfect moment to capture a glimpse of them. One early morning, I remember spending hours perched in a tree, my eyes fixed on a nest, waiting for the birds to emerge. When they finally did, it was like seeing a secret world that had been hidden from me all along. This same patience and persistence has carried over into other aspects of my life. When I am faced with a difficult challenge, I take a step back and reflect on what I have learned from watching birds. I remind myself that every moment is an opportunity to learn something new and that with persistence, anything is possible. Birdwatching has also taught me about the interconnectedness of the natural world. For example, while watching a group of birds, I noticed a butterfly fluttering nearby. It was a beautiful moment, and I realized that every creature has a unique role to play in the ecosystem. We are all connected in some way, and it is important to respect and protect the natural world. Perhaps the most important lesson that I have learned from my experiences with birds is the importance of finding joy in life's simple pleasures. Watching birds is a reminder to slow down and appreciate the beauty that surrounds us. Whether it is the sight of a majestic eagle soaring overhead or the sound of a chickadee singing in the forest, these moments bring us back to what is truly important in life. In conclusion, birds have taught me many valuable life lessons. Through patience and persistence, I have come to appreciate the beauty of the natural world. By understanding the interconnectedness of all living things, I have gained a greater appreciation for the delicate balance of the ecosystem. And by finding joy in life's simple pleasures, I have learned to appreciate the present moment and all that it has to offer.

H,73,"The ground beneath me began to shake as an oil truck instantly burst into flames. A massive ball of fire flared into the sky, illuminating my awestruck eyes. Suddenly, hundreds of gallons of water rushed down onto the truck, safely extinguishing the blaze. “CUT!” a director yelled. I cheered, astonished by the scene I had just witnessed. My love for Hollywood began with moments like these from my childhood. Disney’s Hollywood Studios was home to attractions like The Great Movie Ride and The Studio Backlot Tour, both of which introduced me to the special effects, intricate illusions, and thrilling stunts seen in professional films. These two attractions were early indicators of my love for filmmaking, I just didn’t know it yet. Years later, I am still captivated by the magic of cinema. Whether it be a summer blockbuster, an Oscar-hopeful, or a cult classic, I’ll take any opportunity I can get to experience an original film. For a few hours, I can forget about the world around me, becoming completely immersed in the universe on-screen. Characters come alive, their personalities and stories intertwining themselves with real-life experiences of my own. I’ve always been what you would call a “tomboy”, a far-from-fragile girl who loves football and loathes dresses. Having strong female characters like Hermione Granger and Princess Leia to look up to on-screen has had a profound impact on my confidence as a young woman. Seeing another woman hold her ground and stand up for herself was truly inspiring to me. I may not wield a wand or a blaster, but I’ve certainly used the strength of these characters as a personal inspiration to stay confident and secure in myself. My passion for film does not end with characterization. I am just as invested in the technical, behind-the-scenes aspects of cinema. Cinematographers bring stunning landscapes and perfectly-framed shots to life, invoking awe and emotion in both casual moviegoers and film fanatics. Lighting designers shape a film’s mood and tone, adding flares of emotion and rich symbolism to climatic scenes. I still have so much to learn about filmmaking, and I cannot wait to tackle the challenges that come with producing a film. When I do, I know that I’ll put my heart into it. Maybe my protagonist will defy the stereotypes that surround young women, choosing jeans over skirts and football over dance. Maybe she’ll love brisk autumn mornings, and never understand the appeal of hot, sticky, summer afternoons. Maybe she’ll discover her peculiar affinity for both science and cinema. Whichever direction I decide to take my characters and my story, my life experiences will have a huge impact on the final product. This is yet another thing that I love about movies; they are entirely unique to the individual who creates them. No two people could create the same exact film no matter how hard they tried — there’s always a little bit of a director’s soul woven into their work. I’m still unsure whether I’ll follow my passion for film into a full-time career or a part-time hobby. If I decide to pursue filmmaking, I hope to use my platform to spread a message of hope, perseverance, and strength. Films can reach millions, possibly even billions of people, giving me the perfect opportunity to make a profound impact on someone’s life. If just one person can be inspired by one of my characters, much like I was by Hermione and Leia, I’ll be satisfied. Even if I never sell out theaters or break a box office record, I will have achieved success if I can make someone’s life just a little bit better through my work. Through filmmaking, I hope to invoke the same sense of wonder and awe that I once felt as I experienced the magic of cinema for the very first time.

This is my chance to showcase my passion for filmmaking, to share with the world the stories I want to tell, and to bring my unique perspective to the world of cinema. For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by the art of storytelling. As a child, I would spend hours reading books, watching movies, and listening to music, all in an effort to understand the world around me and the people who inhabit it.

It's a feeling unlike any other – that rush of adrenaline when you know you've captured the perfect shot, the excitement of watching your vision come to life on the big screen. But filmmaking is more than just a technical process of capturing moving images. It's about the power of storytelling, the ability to connect with audiences in a way that transcends language, culture, and time. As a filmmaker, I have the unique opportunity to share my perspective with the world, to tell stories that matter and to bring people together through the magic of cinema. My approach to filmmaking is unique in that I am constantly searching for ways to challenge myself and push the boundaries of what is possible. Whether it's experimenting with new camera techniques or exploring different genres and styles of storytelling, I am always looking for ways to evolve and grow as an artist. One of the things that sets me apart from other filmmakers is my desire to tell stories that are both personal and universal. I believe that the most powerful stories are those that come from the heart, that are rooted in personal experiences and emotions, but that also speak to a larger audience. Through my films, I hope to explore the human condition in all its complexity, to challenge our preconceived notions and to encourage empathy and understanding. Of course, being a filmmaker isn't always easy. It requires a tremendous amount of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. But the rewards are worth it. The thrill of seeing your work on the big screen, the joy of connecting with audiences and hearing their reactions, and the satisfaction of knowing that you have created something meaningful and lasting – these are the things that make it all worth it. As I look to the future, I am excited to continue exploring the world of cinema and to share my unique perspective with the world. I know that the road ahead will be long and challenging, but I am confident in my ability to overcome any obstacle and to achieve my dreams. In many ways, filmmaking is a reflection of life itself – it's messy, unpredictable, and full of surprises. But it's also beautiful, inspiring, and endlessly rewarding. As a filmmaker, I am committed to using my craft to make the world a better place, to share stories that matter, and to connect with audiences in a way that only cinema can. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my unique perspective and passion for filmmaking to the Yale or Harvard community.

The hustle and bustle of the city faded away as I emerged from the station, greeted by the bright lights and towering skyscrapers of downtown.

Despite the long hours, the difficult conditions, and the countless setbacks, everyone on set remained focused and determined. It was inspiring to see, and it made me all the more committed to making this film the best it could be. One of the things I love most about filmmaking is the ability to use symbolism to convey a message. In one particular scene, we had the protagonist standing in front of a mirror, staring at her reflection. At first glance, it was a simple shot, but upon closer inspection, it became clear that the mirror represented her inner struggle. The protagonist was at a crossroads in her life, torn between what she knew was right and what she wanted to do. The mirror served as a visual metaphor for her internal conflict, and it was a powerful moment in the film. As the shoot wrapped up, I couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction and pride. We had worked tirelessly to bring this story to life, and the result was a film that we could all be proud of. It was a testament to the power of collaboration, dedication, and hard work. Filmmaking is not just a technical process; it's a creative and emotional one as well. It's about capturing the essence of a story, conveying a message, and making an impact on the world.

H,77,"“How many times did I wake up at 4:15 a.m. this summer?” I found myself once again asking this question as I climbed endless stone steps with bruised shins and dirt-filled fingernails. The answer: twenty-two times. I was in a rush to finish the 48th peak before school began in order to fulfill a goal I set in fifth grade after meeting a wild pack of Appalachian Trail through-hikers. I marveled at their determination. Climbing all 48 four thousand foot peaks within New Hampshire is an ambitious goal that takes some people a lifetime to finish. There I was, at 6:15 a.m., gasping for air and wondering who I should blame for the pain. Maybe I had my parents to blame for my drive to be in the wilderness. They exposed me to the outdoors at a young age, sparking my passion for hiking and backpacking. Having lived in China for four and a half years and traveling the world, I always knew my childhood was unique. Unlike other expatriates, my family dismissed four-star resorts and instead chose to stumble through the alleyways of Hong Kong with an array of camping supplies. As a six-year-old, I was fortunate enough to find myself in Italy running from a wild herd of cattle in the Alps. During our summers in Oregon, instead of renting a car, we pedaled through the hilly streets on a three-person bike. These experiences, that made my family different, instilled in me a sense of adventure. The 48 strenuous climbs and endless miles also brought beautiful vistas. If we were lucky, we got to end the day at a high mountain hut where we drank endless cups of rich hot chocolate. I would sit in the corner of the dining room engrossed in books about rare lichen. At Mizpah hut, I had the chance to talk with a female naturalist about some of the endangered alpine flora. I sat and stared in awe. I didn't know that someone could have a job doing field studies in the mountains. I’ve spent the last six years looking at the sides of the trails for the dwarf Cinquefoil she introduced to me. That’s when I knew I wanted to become a hands-on environmentalist so I could spend more time doing the things I love. Maybe I have the naturalist to blame for all the blisters and early mornings on the trail. Mount Isolation was my last peak. One last push. Number 48. 13.6 miles. After the first grueling thirty minutes, the path opened up and I could see all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. This is the way it always goes. First, the struggle, and then the reward. Mt. Washington glowed like amber. The wind nipped at my fingertips and shook the crooked trees. My heavy breathing competed with the sounds of the white-throated sparrows. I had the entire mountain to myself. Overwhelmed by emotion, I began to cry bittersweet tears. No more waking up at 4:15 a.m. but then again, no more celebratory Cokes at the top. I was done. I decided to let go of the blame for all the early mornings. Instead, I would love to give my fifth grade-self a big “thank you”. The struggles only augmented the joy I felt on the car ride home with music playing and my feet wiggling in the wind. I felt that I had graduated from my childhood. Hiking over the past seventeen years with my family has created endless memories, yet it's time for me to start a new chapter of my life. Maybe I’ll hike the Adirondack 46ers, explore sections of the Appalachian Trail, or guide others through the wilderness. But I know I will always continue to look around and search for rare specimens and marvel at the ordinary. ",1,2.166770652,2.655997668,2.945374207,3.29543938,2.842324623,6.0,11.4,17.0,21.4,15.0
C0,78,"Growing up, I never thought I would become an expat. I had always lived in the same small town in the United States, surrounded by familiar faces and places. But when my father was offered a job in Singapore, my family made the decision to move halfway across the world. As a high school senior, I can now reflect on the transformative experience of being an expat explorer and how it has shaped my perspective on the world. As an expat, I quickly learned that adapting to a new culture requires more than just learning the language and customs. It requires an open mind and a willingness to step outside of one's comfort zone. I vividly remember my first day of school in Singapore, feeling like a fish out of water. The hallways were filled with unfamiliar faces and the classrooms were organized in a way I had never seen before. But instead of retreating to my comfort zone, I pushed myself to engage with my classmates and learn about their cultures. I was fascinated by the diversity of backgrounds and experiences, and how each individual brought something unique to the table. Living as an expat explorer has also given me a new perspective on global issues. Through conversations with my classmates and experiences outside of the classroom, I have come to understand that many of the issues we face as a global community require collaboration and understanding across borders. For example, the issue of climate change affects all of us, regardless of where we live. As an expat living in Singapore, I have seen first-hand the devastating effects of rising sea levels and the importance of taking action to combat climate change. Being an expat has taught me that no matter where we come from, we all have a stake in the future of our planet. In addition to expanding my global perspective, being an expat explorer has also allowed me to explore myself in new ways. Living in a new country has challenged me to question my assumptions and values, and to think critically about who I am and what I believe in. For example, I have had to confront my own cultural biases and assumptions about what is 'normal.' Living in Singapore has taught me to appreciate the diversity of human experience and to celebrate difference, rather than fear it. Perhaps most importantly, being an expat has given me a sense of independence and self-reliance that I might not have developed otherwise. Living in a foreign country has forced me to rely on my own instincts and judgement, and to develop a sense of resilience in the face of challenges. I have learned to trust myself and my abilities, and to believe that I can handle whatever life throws my way. Overall, being an expat explorer has been a transformative experience that has opened my eyes to the beauty and complexity of the world. It has taught me the importance of being open-minded and curious, and the value of embracing diversity. It has given me a sense of purpose and a desire to make a positive impact on the world, no matter where I end up. As I prepare to leave Singapore and return to the United States for college, I feel confident that I am equipped with the skills and perspectives necessary to thrive in a global society.

C1,79,"How many times did I wake up at 4:00 a.m. this summer? More than I can count. As an expat explorer, I have always been fascinated by the world around me. I grew up traveling to different countries, backpacking in the wilderness, and exploring new cultures. These experiences have instilled in me a sense of curiosity and a desire to push myself beyond my limits. But it was not until I moved to Singapore that I truly learned the meaning of loving exploration. The first few months were a blur of jetlag and culture shock. Everything was new and unfamiliar, from the spicy food to the chaotic traffic. I struggled to adjust to the pace of life in a bustling metropolis, and often found myself feeling overwhelmed and homesick. But as time passed, I began to embrace the challenges of living in a foreign country. I joined a hiking group and discovered the beautiful nature reserves hidden within the city-state. I signed up for language classes and started to communicate with locals in their native tongue. I immersed myself in the vibrant cultural scene, attending music festivals, art exhibitions, and food markets. Through these experiences, I learned that loving exploration is not just about discovering new places or trying new things. It's about being open to the world around us, and embracing the unknown with an adventurous spirit. It's about stepping outside of our comfort zones and pushing ourselves to grow. One of the most transformative experiences of my time as an expat explorer was climbing Mount Kinabalu, the highest peak in Southeast Asia. The hike was grueling, with steep ascents and treacherous terrain. We started at 2:00 a.m. in order to reach the summit by sunrise, and I remember feeling both excited and nervous as we set out in the dark. As we climbed higher and higher, the air grew thin and the temperature dropped. My muscles ached and my lungs burned. But with every step, I felt a sense of determination and perseverance. I was surrounded by a group of strangers from all over the world, united in our shared goal of reaching the summit. As we emerged from the darkness and approached the peak, I was struck by the breathtaking beauty of the sunrise. The sky was painted in hues of pink and orange, and the clouds below us looked like a sea of cotton candy. I felt a sense of awe and wonder that I had never experienced before. In that moment, I realized that loving exploration is not just about physical endurance or mental toughness. It's about finding beauty in the world around us, and experiencing moments of pure joy and wonder. It's about connecting with others and building meaningful relationships, even in the midst of adversity. As I prepare to return to the United States for college, I carry with me the lessons I have learned as an expat explorer. I am excited to continue exploring the world around me, but I also know that loving exploration is not just about traveling to new places. It's about being open to new experiences, even in the familiar surroundings of home. It's about embracing the unknown with an adventurous spirit, and finding beauty in the everyday moments of life. Being an expat explorer has taught me the value of resilience, independence, and open-mindedness. It has challenged me to confront my own biases and assumptions, and to embrace diversity in all its forms. It has given me a sense of purpose and a desire to make a positive impact on the world, no matter where I end up.

C2,80,"How many times did I wake up at 4:00 a.m. this summer? It felt like a never-ending cycle of darkness, but it was all worth it for the love of exploration. As an expat explorer, I've learned that loving exploration is about more than just visiting new places. It's about immersing oneself in the environment and allowing the senses to guide the experience. Living in Singapore, I've had the opportunity to explore the lush greenery that surrounds the city-state. One of my most memorable hikes was through the MacRitchie Reservoir Park, where I was enveloped by the sounds and smells of the tropical rainforest. The chirping of birds and insects filled the air, and the scent of damp earth and fresh vegetation made me feel like I was a part of the ecosystem. The sensation of the soft mud beneath my feet and the heat of the sun on my skin reminded me of my place in the natural world. On another occasion, I had the chance to experience the vibrant cultural scene of Singapore during the annual Chinese New Year celebrations. The streets were filled with the sound of drums and cymbals, and the air was thick with the scent of burning incense. The bright red lanterns and decorations added a festive touch, and the crowds of people in traditional attire created a sense of community and belonging. It was a sensory overload, and I felt completely immersed in the culture. Perhaps the most transformative experience of my time as an expat explorer was a journey to Mount Kinabalu, the highest peak in Southeast Asia. The climb was grueling, with steep inclines and treacherous terrain. But it was the sights and sounds that made the experience truly unforgettable. As we ascended, the temperature dropped and the wind picked up, causing my teeth to chatter and my fingers to numb. The sky above us was a deep, dark blue, and the stars shone like diamonds. The sound of my breath and the crunch of my boots on the gravel echoed through the stillness. It was a moment of complete solitude, and yet I felt more connected to the world than ever before. As the sun began to rise, the colors of the sky shifted from deep blue to shades of pink and orange. The clouds below us looked like a sea of cotton candy, and the wind whistled through the crevices in the rock. It was a symphony of sight and sound, a reminder of the beauty and power of nature. Through these experiences, I've learned that loving exploration is not just about the destination, but about the journey itself. It's about allowing oneself to be fully present in the moment, to experience the world through all the senses. It's about embracing the unknown with an adventurous spirit, and finding beauty in unexpected places. Living as an expat explorer has taught me the value of resilience, independence, and open-mindedness. I've had to navigate new cultures and environments, and learn to adapt to unfamiliar situations.

As I prepare to embark on a new journey in college, I carry with me the lessons of loving exploration. I look forward to continuing to explore the world around me, to allow my senses to guide me on the journey. Whether it's hiking through a rainforest, experiencing a cultural celebration, or climbing a mountain, I know that there will always be something new and exciting to discover.

H,81,"Contrary to popular belief, mini-golf is very challenging. The unforgiving, neon green turf and the jagged rock formations send my ball spiraling in the wrong direction and careen straight into the roaring waterfall every time. The irony of my inadequate skills, however, is not lost on my younger sister, who routinely avoids obstacles and sinks her ball straight into the hole. Her embarrassing victory dance follows soon after, much to my own dismay. Notwithstanding my mini-golf shortcomings, I am known as “golf girl” by my peers and have learned much about myself and the game as the sole girl on my high school’s golf team. Growing up hearing tales of the golf team that my father coached and watching the LPGA from my grandfather’s couch instilled me with a passion for golf. Looking up to Annika Sörenstam and other talented women who played with such grace and power ultimately gave me some dynamic, passionate role models to look up to. When the coach cut me from middle school golf tryouts, bright purple junior clubs in hand, I was determined to get better and committed to making myself and my role models proud. I began taking over 100 swings each night and spent countless hours on the putting green dreaming of that match winning putt. After being turned away, the sense of accomplishment in being one of the team’s leaders in the following season was one of the best feelings in the world. For the past six years, I have become accustomed to the mannerisms, smell, and humor of teenage golf boys. However, arriving at the first match brimming with four teams full of tall, strong boys and not another girl in sight made me gulp. The shorter bathroom line was a bonus when I first arrived at the course, but all was forgotten when I went to take my first shot from the female tee box. My teammate, James, walked up to me, noticing my apprehension, and told me the most random, bizarre joke that I had ever heard. In that moment, I knew my teammates had my back, even if I did not always completely comprehend their humor. Over time, the team grew into a tight-knit group of friends who fit together like a puzzle. James can break a bad round with a laugh, Matt gives the best pep talks, and Drew is reliable for sound shot advice, while my niche emerged as bringing positivity and optimism after a bad shot. This team dynamic continued in school as well, as James comes to me after a bad test, while I see Matt before a big presentation. Whether we are on or off the course, we help each other to succeed. As the daughter of two teachers, country club simulators and memberships to the area’s elite courses were not options for me. Two summers ago, I took matters into my own hands and got a job cleaning out dirty carts and taking out the trash at the local country club. Scrubbing the spilled adult beverages out of the cup holders and disposing of the deteriorating cigars was not how I pictured spending my summers, but was valuable for the free rounds I played. By the end of the summer, I realized my hard work leveled the playing field between myself and my more affluent opponents. This gentleman’s sport has become such a significant part of my life. The amount of joy I receive from sinking a lengthy putt or driving my ball straight down the center of the fairway reminds me just how grateful I am to play this sport.

C0,82,"As a female golfer, I have experienced a unique set of challenges and triumphs that have shaped my character and taught me valuable life lessons. While many may view golf as a leisurely sport, it has been a passion of mine for the past six years and has provided me with opportunities for growth and self-discovery. My journey as a golfer began when I was introduced to the sport by my father. Initially, I was hesitant to take it up as I did not fit the typical image of a golfer, especially a female one. However, my father's unwavering support and encouragement motivated me to take up the challenge and pursue the sport. One of the biggest challenges I faced was the lack of female representation in the sport. Golf has always been a male-dominated sport, and it was challenging to find female role models to look up to. However, this only motivated me to work harder and become a trailblazer for other young girls interested in the sport. I began to set my own standards and goals and did not let societal norms limit my aspirations. Playing golf has also taught me the importance of perseverance and discipline. Golf is a sport that requires immense mental focus, physical fitness, and patience. I have learned that every shot, whether good or bad, is an opportunity to learn and improve. This mindset has helped me face setbacks and challenges in other areas of my life, knowing that every obstacle presents a chance for growth and self-improvement. Furthermore, golf has allowed me to develop strong interpersonal skills, which have been invaluable in my personal and academic life. Golf is a sport that requires players to engage in a high level of communication and collaboration, not only with their playing partners but also with the course and weather conditions. Through playing in tournaments and practicing with my teammates, I have learned to effectively communicate and work towards a common goal, a valuable skill that will be essential in my future endeavors. As a female golfer, I have also experienced the impact of gender stereotypes and biases. Many people assume that golf is a sport exclusively for men and that women are not capable of competing at the same level. However, I have seen firsthand the immense talent and skill of female golfers, and I am proud to be a part of a community that challenges these stereotypes. Moreover, being a female golfer has given me the opportunity to break down gender barriers and pave the way for other young girls to follow in my footsteps. Through my participation in various tournaments and leagues, I have been able to advocate for gender equality in sports and promote the importance of diversity and inclusion in all aspects of life. In conclusion, being a female golfer has taught me invaluable lessons that extend beyond the sport. It has taught me the importance of perseverance, discipline, communication, and advocacy.

C2,84,"As I step onto the golf course, the freshly cut grass crunches under my feet. The morning dew saturates the air, enveloping me in a misty haze that adds to the tranquil ambiance of the course. My golf bag, with its worn straps and frayed pockets, is heavy on my back, but I don't mind. It's a familiar weight, one that has accompanied me on countless rounds of golf. Golf has been my passion for the past six years, and it has taught me many valuable lessons. One of the most significant lessons I have learned is the importance of perseverance. Golf is a game of ups and downs, where one shot can change the entire course of a round. Every swing is an opportunity to learn and grow, regardless of whether it is a good or bad shot. I remember a particular round where I struggled from the outset. My tee shots were slicing into the rough, and my putting was erratic at best. It would have been easy to give up and throw in the towel, but I knew that the game was about resilience. As I approached the seventh hole, I noticed a pair of bluebirds perched on a nearby tree branch, chirping in unison. Their song was a reminder that even when things seem bleak, there is still beauty to be found. This small moment of connection with nature brought me back to the present moment, and I approached the ball with renewed focus. I took a deep breath, steadied my hands, and swung. The ball soared through the air, landing perfectly on the fairway. It was a shot that I would have been proud of on my best day, let alone on a round where nothing seemed to be going right. Golf has also taught me the importance of community. Although it is often seen as an individual sport, I have found that the best rounds of golf are played in the company of friends. Golf has brought me closer to my teammates, creating a sense of camaraderie that extends beyond the course. We support each other through good rounds and bad, celebrating each other's successes and lifting each other up during challenging times. One of my most memorable rounds of golf was played with my high school golf team. We were in the middle of a heated match, with the score tied and only a few holes left to play. As we approached the ninth hole, the sun began to set, casting an orange glow across the sky. The wind had picked up, making the shot even more challenging. My teammate, James, stepped up to the ball, his face set in concentration. He took a deep breath, steadied his hands, and swung. The ball sailed through the air, straight towards the green. It landed softly, rolling to a stop just a few feet from the hole. We all erupted into cheers, high-fiving each other and congratulating James on an incredible shot. This moment was a reminder of the power of teamwork and the joy of shared success.

H,85,"75,000 flipped pages. 11,520 packed boxes. 6 school maps. I began measuring my life in flipped pages, packed boxes, and school maps when I was 6. As my family and I flitted between states and coasts for my father’s job over the last decade, I shielded myself with fantasy novels. With my head propped on the baseboard near my nightlight and a book held up in front of me by aching arms, I would dance in whimsical forests, fight daring battles, and rule dangerous courts long after dark. In my fantastic universe, I could take turns being the queen, the knight, the hero, and even the villain. These books helped me express the happiness, anger, sadness, and queerness I could not have even begun to imagine alone. The characters I discovered in novels as I toured libraries and Barnes & Noble stores in strip malls around the country taught me resilience and empowered me to nourish my strengths. Mare Barrow showed me the power of determined women, and I unapologetically strove for academic excellence and obtained a GPA of 4.4. Tane, from The Priory of the Orange Tree, inspired me to push the limits of my own body, so I’ve traversed approximately 1,544 miles in cross-country races and practices. Evelyn Hugo’s unapologetic character compelled me to want to embrace and feel free with my queerness rather than shelter it away in a shameful corner. Even further, this year I am adding a third dimension to my love of fantasy by interpreting Mrs. White in my school’s production of Shuddersome and The Monkey’s Paw with assistance from Anne of Green Gables, my first fictional idol, who massively influenced my personality and tendency for dramatics. But above all, Leigh Bardugu, my favorite author, gave me permission to even dare to write and to dream that I can. What began as a safety net in my adolescence has grown to something more, a true passion for English and all that it can express. Language is power and I wish to wield it like a mighty sword. I want to be the puppetmaster, the speaker, and the leader in a world that is crafted in ink. I want to be a New York Times bestseller and to know that whatever I do is impactful and that it creates a difference, no matter how small. I want to walk down a crowded street and see “my book” spread open in a passing person’s hands, as they refuse to put it down, just like I did so many times in the hallways of my middle school. A writer, a college professor, a publishing lawyer: I want it all, the riots of failure, and the pride of success. Without the assistance of literature, I wouldn’t be who I am today. If I hadn’t grown up fueled on library hauls I wouldn’t have discovered that I love English. I wouldn’t get shivers when I fret for a favorite character or celebrate their triumphs, be as ready to face obstacles, or be as adventurous as I am. Without the moves around the country and back, I wouldn’t have become so resilient and open to change, so adaptable to life, but most importantly I wouldn’t have become so in love with language. With every move I burrowed in books, and with every book I became me. Literature has made me in every way, and the only way I can repay it is to become the penman.

C0,86,"As a child, I was an avid reader of fantasy novels. I would spend hours immersed in the worlds created by J.R.R. Tolkien, J.K. Rowling, and George R.R. Martin, among others. My love for these books continued throughout my teenage years, as I discovered new authors and new worlds to explore. While some might see this as an escapist pastime, I have come to realize that my love for fantasy literature has had a profound impact on my life and has shaped the person I am today. One of the things that draws me to fantasy literature is the way it allows for limitless possibility. In these worlds, anything is possible. Dragons can fly, wizards can cast spells, and magical creatures roam the land. In a world where reality can sometimes feel limiting, it is refreshing to escape into a world where imagination knows no bounds. This has inspired me to think creatively and to approach problems with an open mind, knowing that there may be unconventional solutions that are just waiting to be discovered. Another aspect of fantasy literature that I love is the way it explores complex themes and issues through allegory and metaphor. These stories often deal with issues of power, justice, and morality in a way that is both accessible and engaging. For example, in J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings,' the ring represents the corrupting influence of power, while in George R.R. Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire,' the struggle for the Iron Throne is a metaphor for the corrupting influence of ambition. By grappling with these issues in a fantastical context, these books offer insights into the human condition that are both thought-provoking and entertaining. But perhaps the most significant impact that fantasy literature has had on me is the way it has fostered my sense of empathy and understanding. When we read a book, we step into the shoes of the characters and experience their world through their eyes. In fantasy literature, this is especially powerful, as we are often asked to empathize with characters who are vastly different from ourselves. For example, in 'The Hunger Games,' we are asked to empathize with a teenage girl living in a dystopian world, while in 'Harry Potter,' we are asked to empathize with a young wizard who must confront the evils of his world. Through these experiences, I have come to appreciate the richness and diversity of human experience and to develop a greater sense of compassion and understanding for others. In fact, my love for fantasy literature has led me to explore other forms of storytelling that foster empathy and understanding. For example, I have become interested in documentary filmmaking as a way to share the stories of people whose voices are often marginalized or ignored. I believe that by telling these stories, we can help to break down barriers and build bridges of understanding between different communities. Ultimately, my love for fantasy literature has taught me that imagination is a powerful tool for personal growth and social change. By imagining new worlds and new possibilities, we can expand our minds and challenge our assumptions about the world around us. And by sharing our stories with others, we can build empathy, understanding, and a greater sense of connection with our fellow human beings. As I prepare to embark on the next phase of my life, I am excited to bring this passion for storytelling and empathy to my studies and my future career. Whether I end up studying literature, filmmaking, or something else entirely, I know that the lessons I have learned from fantasy literature will stay with me and continue to inspire me to make a positive impact in the world.",0,2.798920592,3.03090641,3.17338398,3.347441404,3.142809732,12.6,20.6,22.0,25.4,21.0
C1,87,"Throughout my childhood, my family moved frequently due to my father's job, and as a result, I turned to fantasy novels as a constant source of comfort and companionship. With each move, I measured my life in packed boxes, flipped pages, and new school maps. Whether I was navigating a new school or adjusting to a new home, I always had a book in hand, allowing me to escape into magical worlds filled with adventure, danger, and endless possibility. As I devoured these novels, I found myself drawn to the complex characters and the intricate world-building that defined the genre. The heroines I encountered, like Mare Barrow and Evelyn Hugo, showed me the power of determination and unapologetic ambition, inspiring me to strive for academic excellence and to embrace my own queerness without shame or hesitation. Meanwhile, the epic battles and daring quests that defined the worlds of authors like Leigh Bardugo and Samantha Shannon ignited a love of adventure and a desire to push the limits of what I thought was possible. But it was not just the stories themselves that captured my heart; it was the way that these novels opened my eyes to the power of language and the potential for storytelling as a tool for social change. As I grew older, I realized that the themes explored in these novels - issues of power, justice, and morality - were just as relevant in the real world as they were in the pages of my favorite books. Through these stories, I learned to empathize with characters who were vastly different from myself and to see the world through their eyes, fostering a sense of compassion and understanding that has stayed with me to this day. My love for literature has led me to pursue a degree in English, with a focus on creative writing. I am passionate about using language as a tool for social justice, whether through writing my own stories or advocating for diverse representation in the literary world. I dream of becoming a published author, of seeing my words in print and knowing that they have the power to impact others in the way that so many books have impacted me. As I reflect on my journey so far, I realize that literature has been my constant companion, guiding me through the ups and downs of life and shaping the person I have become. It has taught me to embrace my own strength and resilience, to empathize with others, and to use my voice to make a difference in the world. And though I may have begun measuring my life in boxes and maps, it is the pages of the books that have truly defined my journey. In the end, my love for fantasy literature is not just about escaping reality, but about embracing it in all its complexity and beauty.

In these pages, I discovered the strength of the human spirit, and the power of resilience in the face of adversity. One of my favorite characters was a young wizard named Harry Potter, who faced unimaginable challenges but remained steadfast in his determination to defeat evil. His unwavering courage and loyalty to his friends were traits that I admired and aspired to emulate in my own life. I remember vividly the scene in which Harry and his friends were trapped in the Forbidden Forest, facing a deadly threat. Despite the danger, Harry led the charge, determined to protect his friends and overcome their foe. It was a moment that exemplified the power of resilience in the face of overwhelming odds. As I grew older, I began to appreciate the complexities of these stories on a deeper level. The themes of power, justice, and morality were woven into the fabric of each tale, offering insights into the human condition that were both thought-provoking and entertaining. In J.R.R. Tolkien's 'The Lord of the Rings,' the corrupting influence of power is personified in the form of the One Ring, while George R.R. Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' explores the corrupting influence of ambition through the struggle for the Iron Throne. Intrigued by the power of language and storytelling, I decided to pursue a degree in English, with a focus on creative writing. As I delved deeper into the craft, I discovered that specificity was key to creating a vivid and immersive experience for the reader. By incorporating sensory details and symbolism into my writing, I could bring the world of my imagination to life. For example, in a recent short story I wrote, I used the sound of church bells as a symbol for the passing of time and the loss of innocence. The pealing of the bells echoed through the town, a reminder that the world was constantly changing, and that nothing would remain the same forever. The imagery of the bells served as a metaphor for the protagonist's journey, as she navigated the complexities of growing up and coming to terms with the harsh realities of the world around her. Through my writing, I hope to inspire others to see the world in a new light, to explore new perspectives and possibilities, and to use language as a tool for personal growth and social change. Whether through a novel, a short story, or a poem, I believe that words have the power to transform lives, to heal wounds, and to inspire greatness. As I embark on the next chapter of my life, I am excited to see where this passion for literature will take me, and I am grateful for the countless pages that have brought me to where I am today. The sound of a spine cracking, the smell of freshly printed pages, the feel of a hardcover in my palms - these are the sensory details that have defined my journey, and that will continue to guide me as I pursue my dreams.",0,2.973797362,3.195518688,3.37498357,3.649498094,3.286772378,20.0,22.0,25.0,29.0,23.0
H,89,"I dreaded their arrival. The tyrannical cicadas swarmed DC and neighboring areas in 1987, 2004, and again in 2021. I was freaking about Brood X, the worst of them all. Brood X is a cluster of cicadas that descend on Washington, D.C., every 17 years. I live in the epicenter of their swarm. Cicadas battled with mosquitoes for first place in the top tier of the human annoyance pyramid. I hate these off-brand cockroaches. For 17 years, cicadas live underground feasting off of sap, running free of danger. Then, they emerge and face the real world. That sounds familiar. I have lived in the same house, in the same town, for 17 years, with my parents feeding me pasta and keeping me safe. Is it conceivable that I have more in common with cicadas than I previously thought? Cicadas have beady, red eyes. After a year of enduring Zoom classes, attending tele-health appointments, and spending too much time on social media and video games, I too feel a little blurry-eyed and disoriented. But what about their incessant hum and perpetual noise? That is not me. OK, maybe I do make protein shakes with a noisy blender at all hours of the day. Maybe I do FaceTime vehemently with friends, blare music while I shower, and constantly kick a ball around both inside the house and out. At least I do not leave damaged wings, shedded skin, or rotting carcasses everywhere. Smelly soccer socks on the clean carpet after a long practice? Check. Pools of turf in the mudroom after sliding all over the field? You got it. Dirty dishes and trail mix stains after accidentally sitting on a mislaid M&M are hardly as abhorrent as cicada remains, right? The more I reflected, the more I realized these bugs and I are more alike than different. After 17 years of being cooped up, we are both antsy to face new experiences. Of course, cicadas want to broaden their wings, fly, and explore the world, even if it means clumsily colliding into people’s faces, telephone poles, and parked cars. Just like I want to shed my skin and escape to college, even if it means getting lost on campus or ruining a whole load of laundry. Despite all my newbie attributes, I am proceeding to the next phase of my life whether I am ready or not. Only the hardiest of cicadas survive their emergence and make it to trees to mate, lay eggs, and ensure the existence of their species. I want to be a tenacious Brood X cicada. I will know what it means to travel into the wrong classroom before getting laughed at, bump into an upperclassman before dropping textbooks everywhere, fail an exam after thinking I aced it. I may even become the cicada of the lecture hall by asking a professor for permission to go to the bathroom. Like cicadas, I will need time to learn how to learn. No matter what challenge I undergo that exposes and channels my inner-cicada, novice thought process, I will regroup and continue to soar toward the ultimate goal of thriving in college. When I look beyond our beady red eyes, round-the-clock botherment, and messy trails, I now understand there is room for all creatures to grow, both cicadas and humans. Cicadas certainly are on to something ... Seventeen years is the perfect amount of time to emerge and get ready to fly.",1,2.277470215,2.641706386,3.023348249,3.259738858,2.751975089,8.0,12.8,16.6,24.0,15.0
C0,90,"The world is abuzz with the news of the impending cicada emergence. After 17 years underground, these curious insects are set to emerge in massive numbers across the eastern United States. As a high school senior, the cicadas’ emergence has caused me to reflect on the cyclical nature of life, growth, and change. For me, the cicada emergence symbolizes a moment of renewal, a time when the natural world is given a chance to refresh itself. After 17 years, these insects will burst forth from the earth, shedding their exoskeletons and beginning the next phase of their lives. This process of shedding and renewal is something that we can all learn from. As I look ahead to my own future, I am reminded that life is full of cycles. We all go through periods of growth, transformation, and renewal. Whether we are starting a new job, moving to a new city, or simply taking on a new challenge, each new experience brings with it the opportunity to shed our old selves and become something new. Of course, change is never easy. Like the cicadas, we often have to shed our old ways of being and take on new, unfamiliar forms. But it is through this process of shedding and renewal that we grow and develop as individuals. As I prepare to leave high school and move on to college, I know that I will be faced with many new challenges and opportunities. But I am excited for this next phase of my life, for the chance to shed my old habits and ways of thinking and embrace new perspectives and ways of being. Like the cicadas, I believe that we are all part of a larger cycle of growth and renewal. And while this cycle can be difficult at times, it is ultimately what allows us to evolve and become better versions of ourselves. As I watch the cicadas emerge from the ground in the coming weeks, I will be reminded of this cycle of growth and renewal. I will be reminded of the importance of shedding our old selves and embracing new opportunities. And I will be reminded of the power of the natural world to teach us valuable lessons about life and ourselves. In many ways, the cicadas are a symbol of hope, a reminder that even in the face of difficult challenges, there is always the potential for growth and renewal. As I embark on this next phase of my life, I will carry this message with me, knowing that with each new experience, I have the chance to shed my old self and become something new. So, while the cicadas may seem like just another insect, they are, in fact, a powerful symbol of the cyclical nature of life. And as I prepare to apply to top-tier universities like Yale and Harvard, I will be mindful of this lesson, knowing that my own growth and development are part of a larger cycle of change and renewal.",0,2.649667422,2.872939801,3.01018372,3.334510916,2.893910515,16.4,19.0,23.0,27.4,22.0
C1,91,"As a high school senior, I have been anticipating the arrival of the Brood X cicadas, but unlike most people, I was looking forward to their emergence. My fascination with these insects may seem odd, given their notorious reputation for being noisy and annoying, but I have come to see them as a symbol of personal growth and transformation. Like the cicadas, I have been cocooned in a safe and predictable environment for the last 17 years. Living in the same house, attending the same school, and spending time with the same friends, I have developed a sense of comfort and familiarity that has shielded me from the uncertainties and challenges of the outside world. But just like the cicadas, I know that this cannot last forever. The cicadas’ emergence is a natural process of shedding their old selves and transforming into something new. Similarly, as I prepare to graduate high school and embark on the next phase of my life, I too must shed my old habits and ways of thinking in order to grow and develop. At first, I saw the cicadas as a nuisance, but upon reflection, I came to see them as a source of inspiration. Like the cicadas, I am facing the unknown and the unfamiliar, but I am excited about the opportunities for growth and transformation that lie ahead. The cicadas’ perseverance and determination have taught me that growth and transformation are not easy, but they are essential for personal development. The cicadas’ journey from underground to the treetops is fraught with challenges and dangers, but they persist and push forward, driven by their innate desire to mate and ensure the survival of their species. As I prepare to apply to top-tier universities like Yale and Harvard, I know that the road ahead will be challenging, but I am ready to embrace the unknown and push myself to grow and develop. I am inspired by the cicadas’ tenacity and resilience, and I know that their example will serve me well as I face the challenges and uncertainties of the future. Like the cicadas, I am also learning to adapt to new environments and situations. The cicadas must navigate a world that is unfamiliar and often hostile, but they adapt and thrive, using their instincts and innate abilities to survive and reproduce. As I prepare to leave the familiarity of high school behind and enter the world of college, I too must learn to adapt to new environments and situations. I will be faced with new challenges, new people, and new ideas, but I am excited about the opportunities for growth and learning that lie ahead. In many ways, the cicadas’ emergence is a metaphor for the transformative power of change. Change can be difficult and uncomfortable, but it is essential for personal growth and development. The cicadas’ emergence is a reminder that even in the face of uncertainty and adversity, there is always the potential for growth and renewal. As I watch the cicadas emerge from the ground in the coming weeks, I will be reminded of the power of change and transformation. I will be reminded that growth and development are essential for personal and intellectual growth, and that the road ahead may be challenging, but it is also filled with opportunity. In conclusion, while many people may view the cicadas as a nuisance, I have come to see them as a symbol of personal growth and transformation. Like the cicadas, I am facing the unknown and the unfamiliar, but I am inspired by their perseverance and determination to push forward and adapt to new situations.

C2,92,"The cicadas have arrived, and with them, a symphony of sound fills the air. Their buzzing hum is a constant presence, a reminder of the cyclical nature of life and growth. I am surrounded by these insects, and their presence is both awe-inspiring and overwhelming. As I walk through my neighborhood, I am struck by the sheer number of cicadas that have emerged from their underground slumber. The trees are alive with their clicking and buzzing, and the ground is littered with their discarded exoskeletons. The air is thick with the pungent scent of their pheromones, a potent mixture of earthy sweetness and musk. Despite their reputation as a nuisance, I cannot help but marvel at the cicadas' transformation. For 17 years, they have lived underground, hidden away from the world, and now they have emerged as something new and beautiful. They shed their old skins, revealing wings that shimmer like stained glass in the sunlight. They take flight, clumsily at first, but soon soaring through the air with grace and ease. Their transformation is symbolic of the changes that we all go through in life. We spend years cocooned in our safe and familiar environments, but eventually, we must shed our old selves and take flight. We must face the unknown and the unfamiliar, and it is through this process of transformation that we grow and develop. As I watch the cicadas fly through the air, I am reminded of the resilience and perseverance that they embody. These insects have survived for 17 years underground, enduring harsh conditions and unpredictable environments. But they have emerged stronger and more beautiful than ever before. I think of my grandmother, who faced numerous challenges throughout her life, including the loss of her husband and the onset of a debilitating illness. Despite these setbacks, she remained resilient, always finding a way to move forward and make the best of each day. Her resilience was not just a trait, but a quality that I learned through example. I recall a time when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer, and she underwent a grueling course of chemotherapy. Despite the physical and emotional toll that it took on her, she remained positive and determined to beat the disease. She showed incredible strength and courage, inspiring me to face my own challenges with the same resilience and determination. The cicadas, too, inspire me to be resilient and persevere in the face of adversity. Their buzzing hum is a constant reminder of the challenges that we all face in life, but it is also a reminder of the beauty and transformation that can come from perseverance and resilience. As I continue to walk through my neighborhood, I am struck by the diversity of the cicadas' appearances. Some have vibrant green wings, while others are a mottled brown. Some are small and delicate, while others are robust and imposing. But despite their differences, they are all united in their transformation, shedding their old selves to become something new and beautiful. Their diversity is symbolic of the different paths that we all take in life. We all have our own unique journeys, our own challenges and triumphs. But just like the cicadas, we can all emerge from our struggles as something new and beautiful. In conclusion, the cicadas are a symbol of transformation and resilience. Their emergence is a reminder of the challenges that we all face in life, but it is also a reminder of the beauty and transformation that can come from perseverance and resilience.

H,93,"I was born to two moms. One, my biological mom, Meredith. One, my mom who adopted me, Mary. Because they were a same-sex couple, the law required that Mary adopt me in order to be my parent. They used Sperm Donor 3311. All I know about my “father” is that he didn’t have a familial history of cancer, he has a twin brother who is 6'4', and he studied math in school. This is all background information; I don’t even know his name. He doesn’t know mine, nor does he know that I even exist. People often ask “What does your father do for a living?” and I’m forced to respond “I actually have two moms,” triggering reactions like that of my driving instructor, “Oh, well that must be different.” I’m 17-years-old and still don’t know how to respond to these comments. When I was 5, Mary, who had been sick for a long time with leukemia, passed away, and my life was turned upside down. I was old enough to understand grief, and yet I still question why it happened. It was terrifying seeing my mom break down while saying, “Mom died last night.” I wonder what I missed out on and carry guilt that I don’t remember much about Mary, because we just didn’t have enough time together. Many say grief gets easier with time, however, I think the way you grieve just changes over time. The world kept spinning and, in 2011, my biological mom met another woman, who soon became my stepmom. However, to me, Kerry is also my mom. No longer do I reveal the fact that I have two moms; now I get reactions to the fact that I have three. Not knowing my father doesn’t leave a void in my life. “Dad” didn’t sing “there was an old lady who swallowed a fly” and tickle me when the old lady swallowed the spider, my moms did. He didn’t take me to Gunpowder Friends Meeting where I shook hands and spent time with 80-year-old friends from the retirement home, my moms did. He didn’t console me when I began crying at the dry-erase board at school because it reminded me of white boards Mom wrote on when she was unable to talk. He didn’t teach me that love is love. He didn’t teach me who I was becoming, my moms did that. I’ve never known my father or that I was supposed to have one, so why would I think my life is any different from the so-called “norm?” If there’s one thing I have learned from my parents, it’s that I have developed a love for difference. I openly accept all those around me and excitedly anticipate the relationships that I will build in my future. There is no such thing as a normal family structure, and my upbringing has given me that greater world view. My moms have raised me to believe that I can accomplish anything. There are still limits, though. My family chooses not to travel to Jamaica because we aren’t accepted there. Before each family vacation, we must research to see if it is a gay-friendly place. I don’t know the answers to questions about my dad’s side of the family. But I don’t let those kinds of things get to me because instead I can talk about the people who raised me. The world is changing as we speak. “Normal” is fading, but it has already disappeared for me.

While the social and political implications of my family dynamic are often discussed, my personal experiences with two moms are something that I have never been able to fully communicate. Until now. Growing up, I was often confronted with questions about my family structure. While I was never ashamed, I was also never quite sure how to explain it to others. My moms have been together for over twenty years, and have provided me with a stable and loving home. They’ve always encouraged me to be true to myself and to stand up for what I believe in. While I’ve always been grateful for this, there were moments where I felt isolated because of my family dynamic. When my peers talked about their own parents, I often struggled to contribute, unable to find a way to express the intricacies of my own upbringing. Despite the challenges, having two moms has shaped me into the person I am today. I’ve grown up with a deep respect for the power of love, and have learned that it can exist in many different forms. My moms’ love for each other has shown me that true commitment and dedication are possible in any relationship. I’ve also learned that family is not always defined by blood ties, but rather by the love and support we give to one another. Living in a society that is still struggling to fully accept LGBTQ+ families has also taught me the importance of standing up for what I believe in. My family has always been politically active, and I’ve had the opportunity to attend rallies and speak with lawmakers about issues that affect my community. Through these experiences, I’ve learned that change is possible, but it requires hard work and dedication. I’ve also learned that sometimes the most powerful change happens on a personal level, when we challenge the beliefs of those closest to us.

C2,96,"I was born into a family with two moms, and from the moment I entered this world, I was enveloped in their love. The sound of their voices, the scent of their skin, the softness of their touch - all of these things served as a constant reminder of the warmth and security that surrounded me. Growing up, I was acutely aware of the fact that my family was different from those around us. There were times when I felt a sense of isolation because of this, but my moms always made sure that I knew how loved and accepted I was. They taught me that love knows no boundaries, and that family is defined not by biology but by the connections we make with those we care about. One of my earliest memories is of my moms reading me bedtime stories. As they would sit with me in the quiet of my room, I could feel the rhythm of their voices and the gentle sway of the rocking chair beneath us. The stories they read were full of adventure and wonder, transporting me to far-off lands and introducing me to fantastical creatures. I felt safe and loved in those moments, and I knew that no matter what challenges lay ahead, my moms would always be there to guide me through them. As I grew older, my moms' love continued to shape my experiences. They instilled in me a sense of resilience and determination that has served me well throughout my life. I remember watching as they faced challenges with grace and determination, never giving up even in the face of adversity. Their example taught me that resilience is not just about overcoming obstacles, but about staying true to yourself and your beliefs even when it seems like the world is against you. My moms were also my biggest supporters, cheering me on as I pursued my passions and dreams. They would come to every game, concert, and event, always there to offer a hug or a word of encouragement. Their love and support gave me the confidence to take risks and chase my goals, knowing that no matter what happened, they would always be there to catch me if I fell. Despite the challenges we faced as a family, my moms never lost sight of the beauty and wonder in the world around us. They taught me to appreciate the small things, from the scent of freshly baked cookies to the sound of raindrops on the roof. They showed me that even in the darkest of moments, there is always something to be grateful for. Looking back on my childhood, I realize how lucky I was to have grown up in a family with two moms.

H,97,"“The difference between an anti-personnel and an anti-tank mine is not that complicated,” I am told casually, in halting Russian, by a boy even younger than I am during a walk through the Chechen mountains. I am freshly 14 and visiting my father’s homeland for the first time, unfamiliar with the harsh realities that kids half my age already know ironclad. My guide points out the areas where the grass is overgrown and the fruit trees abundant. People and animals alike know to avoid them; someone has learned of landmines the hard way. It shouldn’t surprise me — the scars of war on this rugged country are omnipresent — but it is so jarringly different from my life in London that it is nevertheless hard to digest. It also differs from my father’s rosy stories about his childhood in Katyr-Yurt, stories that made me wish to swim carefree in icy rivers, devour handfuls of fresh sour cherries straight from the tree, and see nights dense with stars. I still experience these beauties of place, but my eyes are now open to the less romanticized parts, both enriching and complicating my connection to my family’s past. Suddenly, too, I am made uncomfortably aware of the conflicting layers of my familial identity. It is the Russian of my Muscovite, Jewish mother that I grew up speaking at home. Yet the Chechen children speak in broken Russian, and the grownups who are more fluent in it are not keen to communicate in the enemy’s language. Seeing the ugly scars of war, both physical and psychological, I cannot help but feel like an intruder, ashamed not only of my Russianness but also of my city-boy naivete. Despite this shame, I yearn to discover what it means to be Chechen, to see their home through their eyes, and through this desire, I begin to feel a deep connection all of my own to this beautiful, fraught land. In Moscow, my new awareness of conflicting identities only intensifies, but now on account of the maternal side of my heritage. Relatives there largely see Chechens as terrorists and raise an eyebrow when they hear where I have spent my summer. Babushka’s neighbour, a nurse who witnessed the carnage from the theatre siege in Moscow, turns away disgustedly when she overhears me relate the beauty of the mountains and the notable generosity of the people. Once again, I register the fear and distrust of “the other” that reigns in the more homogeneous cultures in Russia, making me appreciate the diversity of London all the more. When I return there, I cannot slip back into life as normal as I have done after past summers. I find myself pondering the question of identity and the way people interpret their own past, informed just as much by collective emotion and memory as by fact. The cosmopolitanism of London is just as I remembered it, but the things I loved about it I now see in a new light. I had always revelled in the fact that, despite our differences in heritage, my peers and I had seen each other as the same — bound together by being Londoners first and foremost. Now I am interested in conversations that I would never have considered previously, wanting not only to share my newfound experiences but also learn about the personal histories of my friends, many of whom, like me, are the children of immigrants to the UK. When did they come to explore and interrogate their own complicated identities? How did these discoveries make them feel? What does it mean to carry the stories, the poetry, and the pain of so many places within them? Questions like these, which were so important for me to answer about myself, also became a powerful place from which to understand more deeply the people around me and the complex world we share.",1,2.762180645,3.235394996,3.43999743,3.740236962,3.324630705,16.0,22.8,28.8,34.0,26.0
C0,98,"As a Chechen-American, I have often grappled with the complex and multifaceted nature of my identity. Growing up, I was constantly reminded of the violence and turmoil that has plagued my ancestral homeland, yet I was also acutely aware of the vibrant and rich culture that has sustained my people for centuries. It is this duality, this tension between the past and present, that has shaped my understanding of myself and my place in the world. At its core, Chechen identity is rooted in a deep sense of pride and resilience. Despite enduring centuries of colonization and oppression, the Chechen people have maintained a strong sense of cultural and national identity. This resilience has been especially evident in the face of the brutal wars that have ravaged Chechnya in recent decades. Despite the unimaginable suffering and trauma inflicted upon them, the Chechen people have refused to be defeated. Instead, they have continued to uphold their traditions, language, and values, demonstrating an unwavering commitment to their heritage and their community. However, as a Chechen-American, my relationship to my culture is inherently complicated. I was born and raised in the United States, and my experiences and values have been shaped by the unique circumstances of my upbringing. While I am proud of my Chechen heritage and feel a deep connection to my ancestral homeland, I also feel a strong sense of American identity. This duality has often left me feeling caught between two worlds, struggling to reconcile my love for my culture with my desire to assimilate into mainstream American society. One of the key challenges of navigating this duality is the language barrier. While I grew up speaking both English and Chechen, I have always felt more comfortable expressing myself in English. This is partly due to the fact that English is the language of my education and the broader society in which I live, but it is also because I have not had as much opportunity to practice my Chechen language skills. This has left me feeling somewhat disconnected from my cultural heritage, as language is such a fundamental part of identity. Another challenge I have faced is the stereotype and misconceptions that exist about Chechens and the wider Muslim community. The Chechen people have been unfairly demonized in the media, often portrayed as violent extremists or terrorists. This narrative not only erases the complex and nuanced history of Chechnya, but also perpetuates harmful stereotypes about Muslims more broadly. As a result, I have often found myself having to educate others about my culture and religion, while also working to dismantle harmful stereotypes and biases. Despite these challenges, I remain deeply committed to my Chechen identity and the values that it represents. In particular, I am inspired by the strong sense of community and solidarity that is so central to Chechen culture. Whether through music, dance, or storytelling, the Chechen people have always found ways to come together and support one another in times of need. This spirit of community is something that I try to emulate in my own life, both within my own family and within my broader community. Ultimately, my experiences as a Chechen-American have taught me the importance of embracing complexity and nuance. Identity is not a static or monolithic thing; rather, it is a dynamic and constantly evolving part of who we are. By recognizing the multifaceted nature of my own identity, I have been able to better understand and appreciate the diversity of the world around me. This has allowed me to build bridges between different communities, and to work towards a more inclusive and just society for all. In conclusion, my Chechen identity has shaped me in countless ways, informing my values, shaping my worldview, and inspiring me to strive for excellence in all that I do.

C1,99,"“Differentiating between an anti-personnel and anti-tank mine is not that complicated,” a boy younger than I am told me in halting English during a visit to my father’s homeland of Chechnya. I was just 14 years old, visiting for the first time and unaware of the harsh realities that children half my age already knew all too well. As we walked through the mountains, he pointed out areas where the grass was overgrown and fruit trees abundant, explaining that people and animals knew to avoid them because of landmines. The scars of war were omnipresent in this rugged country, and I was struck by the harshness of reality in contrast to my life in the United States. My father had regaled me with romanticized stories of his childhood in Katyr-Yurt, tales that made me long to swim carefree in icy rivers, eat handfuls of fresh sour cherries straight from the tree, and marvel at the stars in the night sky. And while I did experience the beauty of the place, I also came to understand the more complicated parts that enriched and complicated my connection to my family's past. As a Chechen-American, I am acutely aware of the conflicting layers of my identity. I grew up speaking Russian at home, thanks to my mother's Muscovite Jewish heritage, but the Chechen children I met in my travels spoke in broken Russian, while the adults more fluent in the language were not always eager to communicate with a representative of the enemy. The scars of war, both physical and psychological, made me feel like an intruder, ashamed not only of my Russianness but also of my city-boy naivete. Despite this shame, I yearned to discover what it meant to be Chechen and to see their home through their eyes. This desire led me to feel a deep connection to this beautiful but fraught land. Upon returning to Moscow, my new awareness of conflicting identities only intensified, but now on account of the maternal side of my heritage. Relatives there largely viewed Chechens as terrorists and raised an eyebrow when they heard where I had spent my summer. A nurse who witnessed the carnage from the theatre siege in Moscow turned away disgustedly when she overheard me relate the beauty of the mountains and the notable generosity of the people. This fear and distrust of 'the other' that reigns in the more homogeneous cultures in Russia made me appreciate the diversity of America all the more. Upon returning to the United States, I found myself pondering the question of identity and the way people interpret their own past, informed just as much by collective emotion and memory as by fact. The cosmopolitanism of America was just as I remembered it, but the things I loved about it I now saw in a new light. I had always reveled in the fact that, despite our differences in heritage, my peers and I had seen each other as the same, bound together by being Americans first and foremost. Now I was interested in conversations that I would never have considered previously, wanting not only to share my newfound experiences but also learn about the personal histories of my friends, many of whom, like me, were the children of immigrants to the US.

C2,100,"I was walking through the rugged mountains of Chechnya with a local boy, who was younger than me, when he began explaining the difference between an anti-personnel and an anti-tank mine. I was only 14 at the time and had never experienced anything like this before. The mountains were breathtakingly beautiful, with wildflowers growing in the valleys and streams meandering through the rocks. The air was fresh and crisp, and the sun was shining brightly overhead. But despite the stunning scenery, the reality of the situation was jarring. The boy showed me areas where the grass was overgrown and fruit trees were abundant, but no one dared to go near them because of landmines. Even the animals knew to avoid them. It was a stark reminder of the violence and turmoil that had plagued this land for years. As we walked, the boy spoke in broken Russian, pointing out different areas and explaining their significance. His words were tinged with a sense of sadness and resignation, and I could sense the weight of history on his young shoulders. I couldn't help but feel a deep connection to this land and the people who called it home, despite my own conflicting feelings about my Chechen-American identity. Later, as I walked through the bustling streets of Moscow, I couldn't help but feel like an outsider. The noise and chaos of the city were overwhelming, and the smoggy air made it hard to breathe. I was staying with relatives on my mother's side, who were largely dismissive of my Chechen heritage. They saw the Chechen people as terrorists and were skeptical of my stories about the mountains and the generosity of the people I had met there. It was a stark contrast to the beauty and resilience I had witnessed in the mountains. One moment that particularly stood out was when we visited a village that had been nearly destroyed during the war. Despite the devastation, the people there were rebuilding their homes and their lives. They welcomed us with open arms, offering us food and drink and sharing stories of their struggles and triumphs. It was a powerful symbol of the resilience and strength that runs deep in the Chechen people. Back in the United States, I found myself grappling with the complex nature of my identity. On the one hand, I felt a deep connection to my Chechen heritage and the values it represented. On the other hand, I was keenly aware of the stereotypes and misconceptions that existed about Chechens and the wider Muslim community. It was a delicate balance, one that required me to navigate the nuances of my own identity while also working to dismantle harmful stereotypes and biases. Despite the challenges, I remained committed to exploring and celebrating the richness of my identity. I sought out opportunities to learn more about Chechen culture and history, and to connect with others who shared my background. And as I did so, I realized that my identity was not something that could be neatly defined or contained. It was a fluid and constantly evolving part of who I was, shaped by my experiences and my interactions with the world around me. In conclusion, my journey to understand and embrace my Chechen-American identity has been a complex and multifaceted one, shaped by the beauty and resilience of the Chechen people, the stereotypes and biases that exist in the wider world, and my own internal struggles with identity and belonging. But through it all, I have come to appreciate the richness and diversity of the world around me, and to understand that our identities are not something that can be easily categorized or contained.

H,101,"I know that I had prepared well for this moment. For two arduous months, I readied my fingers for an exciting concert. No anxiety could undermine my confidence in my preparation, and my piano recital’s success was “in the bag.” I selected three pieces for my repertoire: the ambience of Erik Satie’s Gymnopedie No. 1 as the opener, a somber contemplation of Beethoven’s First Movement of the Moonlight Sonata, and Bach’s light and surreal Prelude in C Major for the conclusion. My shining moment arrived, and I strode purposefully toward the piano. The building in which my performance was held was new, but its dwellers were old. Respect and prestige permeated the atmosphere as I took each stride to my seat. As I sat down, the chair creaked and moaned as if in sympathy with the audience’s aching desire to hear me play. I prepared my sheet music and commenced my epic moment. Never was such an exhilarating performance heard. All of the little techniques and tricks that I practiced were executed perfectly. I captured the dynamics I wanted to express in Satie’s phonological experiment with each chord to which I applied varying pressure. Moving onto one of Beethoven’s most famous works, I crafted the cascading arpeggios of each new chord, which resonated unity uninterrupted in me and in the audience. When I concluded with the airy prelude from Bach’s Well-Tempered Clavier, the room swelled with bliss. Having poured my heart and soul into each piece, I beamed with pride. As customary for a stellar show, I rose to bow to the audience to thank them for their eruption of applause. Flowers were thrown, cheers elicited, and standing ovations bestowed. From the subsiding din came a faint question to rain on my parade: “Could you play something more lively, darling, say, a Neil Diamond song?” I work on weekends at a long-term-care facility, and my geriatric audience, although a pleasure with whom to interact, can be brutally honest. Begrudgingly, I thanked Mrs. Hersch for her request, promised her better next time, and stewed in my own irrelevance. Going home that day, my feathers were ruffled. How could any civilized listener, after such a superb medley, disregard such time-honored compositions? The notion was absurd. Yet perhaps more outlandish, as I later acknowledged, was my visceral reaction to the events that had transpired. Why did I react hesitantly to a simple request made in earnestness? It would have been easier, in fact, to practice “Sweet Caroline” than to break my fingers over Beethoven’s work. Then, in my moments of introspection, I concluded that my choice of musical pieces mattered little as long as my audience enjoyed them. Whether it meant recreating the most tortured and heinously composed pop song or a masterfully crafted Romantic concerto, I vowed to play them all. Throughout my life, my adult mentors have succored me with platitudes when most needed, which laid the foundation for my confidence. Yet, while working with people who have lived five times longer than I have, experiencing so much more than I can imagine, I know that the world does not revolve around my tastes and interests. I’m okay with that. Thus, for a couple of hours each day in the living room, unlucky family members passing by are subjected to the torment of my tenth run-through of “Sweet Caroline” as I prepare for my next recital for an audience that has taught me more about personal preferences, and myself, than I anticipated.",1,2.60913347,2.845690156,3.118494037,3.32784823,2.934877358,10.0,14.0,19.0,24.0,16.0
C0,102,"Music has been an integral part of my life for as long as I can remember. From the moment I first tinkered on the keys of my family's piano, I was hooked. Over the years, my passion for music has only grown stronger, and I've been lucky enough to pursue my love for the art by taking piano lessons and performing in various recitals and competitions. However, it wasn't until I discovered the works of Ludwig van Beethoven and Neil Diamond's 'Sweet Caroline' that I truly understood the power of music. Beethoven's music has always been a source of inspiration for me. His compositions, especially his piano sonatas, are works of art that display his immense talent and creativity. Whenever I play one of Beethoven's sonatas, I feel as though I am transported to a different world. I am no longer simply playing notes on a page, but I am telling a story. The dynamics, phrasing, and nuances in his music are so complex and emotionally charged that they require complete concentration and immersion. One of my favorite pieces by Beethoven is his Sonata No. 8 in C minor, also known as the 'Pathétique.' The sonata's first movement is characterized by its melancholic and dramatic opening, which sets the tone for the rest of the piece. The second movement is a stark contrast to the first, with its beautiful and delicate melody. The third movement is a fiery and energetic conclusion to the sonata, leaving the listener with a sense of triumph and resolution. Playing the 'Pathétique' is both challenging and rewarding. It requires technical proficiency, but also emotional depth and expression. When I play this sonata, I feel as though I am channeling Beethoven's own emotions and experiences into my playing. It is a powerful and humbling experience, and it has taught me the importance of dedication, perseverance, and passion. On the other end of the spectrum, there is Neil Diamond's 'Sweet Caroline.' At first glance, it may seem like a simple and straightforward song, but it has a universal appeal that transcends generations and cultures. Whenever I play this song, I am transported to a different kind of world, one that is filled with joy, nostalgia, and unity. 'Sweet Caroline' is a song that brings people together. Its catchy melody and infectious chorus make it a favorite at parties, sporting events, and weddings. Whenever I play this song, I feel as though I am part of a larger community, one that is connected by our shared love for music. Playing 'Sweet Caroline' is a reminder that music doesn't have to be complex or profound to have an impact. Sometimes, the simplest melodies and lyrics can have the most significant impact on our lives. Music is a universal language that transcends boundaries and brings people together, and 'Sweet Caroline' is a perfect example of this. Playing both Beethoven's 'Pathétique' and 'Sweet Caroline' has taught me that music is a multifaceted and ever-changing art form. It can be complex and emotionally charged, like Beethoven's sonatas, or simple and universally appealing, like 'Sweet Caroline.' However, regardless of the genre or style, music has the power to move us, to inspire us, and to connect us to each other. As I look towards the future, I hope to continue exploring and expanding my musical horizons. Whether it be through classical, jazz, pop, or any other genre, I know that music will always be a part of my life.

C2,104,"The moment I walked onto the stage, I felt a rush of excitement and nervousness wash over me. The audience's eyes were on me, and I could sense their anticipation. The room was dimly lit, except for the spotlight that shone down on the piano. As I sat down, the piano bench creaked beneath me, but I was determined to make it my own. I began my recital with Erik Satie's Gymnopédie No. 1. The notes flowed effortlessly from my fingers, each one resonating throughout the room. I could hear the audience's collective breath, as if they were holding it in anticipation of what was to come. Moving on to Beethoven's First Movement of the Moonlight Sonata, I felt a sense of deep contemplation wash over me. The melancholic notes seemed to fill the room with a haunting presence. I could see the audience's faces, each one lost in their own thoughts and emotions. I knew that I had captured their attention, and I was determined to keep it. Finally, I ended my recital with Bach's Prelude in C Major. The notes were light and airy, almost as if they were dancing on the keys. I could feel the audience's energy shift as they were lifted from the somber mood of the previous piece. As I finished the last note, the room was filled with applause. But as I stood to take my final bow, an older woman in the audience spoke up. 'Could you play something more lively, darling, say, a Neil Diamond song?' I felt a pang of disappointment at her words, as if my carefully crafted recital had fallen short. Driving home that night, I couldn't stop thinking about the woman's request. I had put so much effort into my recital, but it wasn't enough to satisfy everyone. It wasn't until I got home and sat down at the piano that I realized the true power of music. I started playing 'Sweet Caroline,' and as the familiar notes flowed from my fingers, I felt a sense of joy wash over me. The music was simple, but it had the power to bring people together.

H,105,"I have never felt such palpable emotion, such profound grief emanating from a space, as I did while hiking through the forest fire scorch in Philmont, New Mexico. A universe had once existed under the protection of these Ponderosa Pine, now black and crusted, turning brittle in the wind. It was a landscape that didn’t sing its laments, but whispered of its loss through every pile of scalded timber and skinny, wavering shadow cast by the hollow towers of ash. I felt prepared when I made the decision to become a scout. I love nature and camping. I love the Scouts BSA program. I love the people. I was definitely not prepared, however, for the numerous challenges I would face during my years as a scout. I was the first female “boy scout” in my town, which continues to be both my greatest honor and a constant reminder of the isolation and insecurity that comes with being any “first.” I became a symbol, whether for good or bad, and my actions not only spoke of me, but of the future young women in Scouts BSA. I felt like an imposter. I wasn’t a strong-willed leader like those who usually have “first” stitched into their title. My seventh-grade acting career did little to veil a shy and insecure girl who crumbled at overheard comments on how I didn’t belong or how girls like me were poisoning BSA’s spirit. As time passed, I found myself waiting to develop the toughened heart that the leaders that I knew held. As my troop and I backpacked in Philmont Scout Ranch this past summer, my doubts and insecurities seemed to echo from this inky forest. Coming from Pittsburgh, I had expected the kind of desert with raspy air and coat hanger cacti. Nothing quite shattered this expectation as much as putting on my last pair of dry socks before the fourth day of downpours. We navigated steep cliffs and vibrant meadows, and pulled ourselves up peak after peak. As the sun set on one of our final evenings, the flat, mountain-ornamented horizon gave way to a modest footpath, daring into a new forest. This forest, differing from the field of burnt pines we had seen prior, had burned several decades ago. The fire had cleared everything and had left its signature singed onto the bottom 10 feet of every tree. The forest floor was clean. Wild grasses with accents of purple and blue flowers blanketed the ground below the pines like snow, which had fallen while the world was asleep, completely untouched and extending to infinity. Above the burnt limbs of the trees, thick bundles of green needles soared into the sky. Not long after Philmont, I was awarded my Eagle Rank, the culmination of my experience as a scout. I believe that my time in Scouts BSA has been the first to the forest that is my life. Though scars remain from my experience, new change and strength have flourished out of the damage. I have come to the conclusion that it is not always the fierce leader who becomes a “first.” It is the extra hours. It is finding a way to listen to criticism and try harder, rather than feel the thorns. It is using one’s own feeling of isolation to see others who feel alone. It is the act of going through the fire and staying with it, allowing it to advance you, which changes people who dare to be a “first” into the leaders that they go down in history as being. As I think back on my experience in Philmont, the first forest we saw, this blackened graveyard, is what I picture. I remember the charcoaled ground so vividly, but more so, I remember the soft purple wildflowers hidden in the desert soil. Though few and far between, against the grieving timber, they were stars.",1,2.530235422,2.861312618,3.030141964,3.447046868,2.922509861,12.8,17.0,19.4,24.6,19.0
C0,106,"As the sun began to rise over the mountains of Philmont, New Mexico, I strapped on my backpack and started my hike. It was the first day of my trek as a member of Boy Scouts of America, an organization I had always admired for their dedication to leadership and outdoor skills. However, there was one significant difference between me and my fellow scouts; I was the first female to participate in a Philmont trek, a fact that made me feel both honored and nervous. Growing up, I was always interested in outdoor activities such as camping, hiking, and kayaking. I would often go on weekend trips with my family to different state parks, and those experiences ignited a love for the great outdoors that still burns within me. As I got older, I began to realize that these activities were more than just a hobby; they were a way to challenge myself and push past my limits. When I heard that the Boy Scouts of America had started allowing girls to join, I knew it was an opportunity I couldn't miss. I wanted to be a part of an organization that valued leadership, service, and personal growth as much as I did. And when I found out that Philmont, the largest backpacking camp in the United States, was opening its trails to girls for the first time, I knew I had to be a part of it. As the first female to participate in a Philmont trek, I knew I had a lot to prove. I had to show not only my fellow scouts but also the staff at Philmont that girls could handle the same challenges as boys. I remember feeling both excited and nervous as I stepped off the bus and into the wilderness of Philmont. The first few days of the trek were tough, to say the least. The altitude was high, and the terrain was rugged. But I was determined to succeed, not only for myself but for all the girls who would come after me. I remember waking up early every morning to ensure that I was ready to go when the rest of the group was. I wanted to show that girls could be just as strong and capable as boys. One of the most challenging parts of the trek was climbing Mount Baldy. It's the highest peak in Philmont, and it stands at over 12,400 feet. The trail is steep and rocky, and the air is thin. As I climbed higher and higher, I remember feeling both physically and mentally exhausted. But I refused to give up. I kept pushing myself, taking one step at a time, until I finally reached the summit. Standing at the top, I felt a sense of accomplishment that I had never felt before. I knew that I had proven to myself and everyone around me that I was just as capable as any boy. But being the first female to participate in a Philmont trek wasn't just about proving something to others; it was also about paving the way for future generations of girls. By participating in this trek, I was breaking down gender barriers and showing that girls could excel in traditionally male-dominated fields. I hope that my experience inspires other girls to take risks and challenge themselves, whether it be in the outdoors or any other area of their lives. Looking back on my Philmont experience, I'm proud of what I accomplished, not just as an individual but also as a member of a group. I made lifelong friendships and learned invaluable skills that will stay with me forever. And while being the first female to participate in a Philmont trek was a unique and challenging experience, I believe that it's just the beginning of a much larger movement towards gender equality in all areas of life.

C1,107,"The forest fire scorch in Philmont, New Mexico was a landscape of loss, a whispering lament of a universe that had once existed under the protection of the Ponderosa Pine. It was a world that spoke of destruction, but for me, it became the backdrop of a journey that was about creation. When I decided to become a scout, I thought I was prepared for the challenges that would come my way. I loved nature, camping, and the Scouts BSA program, and I was eager to participate. However, as the first female 'boy scout' in my town, I found myself facing unexpected challenges. I was a symbol, a representation of the future of young women in Scouts BSA, and I felt the weight of responsibility that came with that role. Unlike the strong-willed leaders who often hold the title of 'first,' I struggled with insecurities and doubts. I wasn't sure if I had what it took to succeed in this new role, and I often found myself waiting for a toughened heart to develop. As my troop and I backpacked through Philmont Scout Ranch, those doubts seemed to echo from the inky forest. The landscape of Philmont was not what I had expected. As we navigated steep cliffs and vibrant meadows, we encountered downpours and a forest that had burned several decades ago. The fire had cleared everything and left its signature singed onto the bottom ten feet of every tree, yet above the burnt limbs, thick bundles of green needles soared into the sky. The forest floor was clean, blanketed with wild grasses and flowers, untouched and extending to infinity. In this landscape of destruction and renewal, I found strength and perseverance that I didn't know I had. I learned that being a 'first' was not about being a fierce leader, but about finding a way to listen to criticism, try harder, and use one's own feelings of isolation to see others who feel alone. It was about going through the fire and staying with it, allowing it to advance you and change you into the leader you were meant to be. As I reflect on my time in Philmont, I realize that the burnt graveyard of trees is what I remember the most. It was a symbol of the challenges I faced as the first female scout in my town, but also of the renewal and strength that came from persevering through those challenges. Like the soft purple wildflowers hidden in the desert soil, I found the courage to shine and become a star despite the grief and loss that surrounded me. After completing my Philmont trek, I was awarded my Eagle Rank, the culmination of my experience as a scout. Though scars from my experience remain, new change and strength have flourished out of the damage. My time in Scouts BSA has been a journey of growth and discovery, not just for me but for all the young women who will come after me. As I look to the future, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I am proud to be part of a movement towards gender equality in traditionally male-dominated fields, and I hope that my experience inspires other young women to take risks, challenge themselves, and pave the way for future generations. In conclusion, my experience as the first female scout in Philmont was both a challenge and an honor. It taught me the importance of perseverance, leadership, and personal growth, and it showed me that even in the face of destruction, renewal and strength can emerge. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this historic moment, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for Scouts BSA and for women in leadership.",0,2.819971386,2.984949638,3.368043675,3.55676215,3.288115525,16.2,19.4,27.0,29.6,22.0
C2,108,"I stepped off the bus and into a world of wilderness at Philmont, New Mexico. The air was crisp and dry, and the scent of pine needles filled my nostrils. I could feel the sun's warmth on my skin, and the sound of twigs snapping under my boots as I took my first steps into the wild. As the first female scout in my town, I knew I had a lot to prove. I was a symbol of progress, but I also felt like an imposter. My insecurities echoed through the forest as my troop and I navigated the steep cliffs and vibrant meadows of Philmont. But as we trudged through the rugged terrain, I realized that this journey was about more than just proving myself to others. It was about pushing past my own limits and discovering what I was truly capable of. As we hiked through the burnt forest, the charred trunks of trees stood like stoic sentinels, their bark blackened by flames. Yet, there was something beautiful about the destruction. The forest floor was clean, blanketed with wild grasses and flowers that sprouted from the ashes. The soft purple wildflowers, a symbol of resilience and renewal, reminded me that even in the face of destruction, life can flourish. One of the most challenging parts of the trek was climbing Mount Baldy. The trail was steep and rocky, and the air was thin. My breath came in ragged gasps as I struggled to put one foot in front of the other. But I refused to give up. I kept pushing myself, taking one step at a time, until I finally reached the summit. The view from the top was breathtaking. The mountains stretched out before me, their peaks shrouded in a blanket of clouds. I felt a sense of accomplishment that I had never felt before. But the trek wasn't just about physical challenges; it was also about building relationships with my fellow scouts. As we sat around the campfire at night, we shared stories and laughed until our stomachs hurt. We cooked meals together and helped each other set up our tents. The bonds we formed during those long, hot days on the trail were stronger than I ever could have imagined. As we hiked back to civilization, I realized that my experience at Philmont had taught me more than just survival skills. It had taught me the importance of pushing past my own limits, of taking risks and embracing challenges. It had taught me that even in the face of destruction, renewal and strength can emerge. And it had shown me that with perseverance and determination, anything is possible. As I look back on my experience as the first female scout at Philmont, I realize that it was more than just a trek through the wilderness. It was a journey of self-discovery, a test of my resilience and strength. It was a reminder that even in the face of adversity, life can be beautiful.

H,109,"I’m 6. The sounds of hornpipe and laughter drift across the gymnasium-turned-cafeteria-turned-auditorium. Mum caught me dancing to some of her old Irish tapes — the Chieftains, Sinead O’Connor. She asked me if I wanted to do it for real. I said sure and went back to dancing. Now a freckled woman digs around in a cardboard box and pulls out a pair of dusty, worn black shoes. “Don’t worry,” she says, “you’ll learn eventually.” The shoes are too big; they sag at the toes. I approach the stage. Twenty-five pairs of eyes fix on me. In a room bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I feel like a clown in an ill-fitting costume. All that matters is the dancing. I’m 9. I sit in the hallway of the Times Square Marriott watching girls in big wigs and sparkly dresses run around, squawking like glamorous, unhinged chickens. In my tartan skirt and simple bun, I feel like an ugly duckling. The bobby pins dutifully securing my bun in place make my scalp ache. My hands slide to my shoes. They’re too tight. Mum put them on her feet to “try and stretch them out a little.” I pass some over-enthusiastic dance moms who put the “mother” in “smother.” I reach the stage. A hundred pairs of eyes fix on me. In a hotel bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I’m out of place. All that matters is the dancing. I’m 12. My brain won’t stop flipping through disastrous scenarios as I stand with my teammates in a hotel in Orlando, Florida. We’ve trained for months, sacrificed everything for this moment. I try to think of happy things: the pride on Dad’s face when he watches me dance, the freedom of flying across a stage on invisible wings. We recite our steps like a poem, the sequences like a song that carries us through an ocean of fiddles, pipes, and drums. My parents sacrificed a lot to send me here. I want to make them proud. I want to make myself proud. We approach the national stage. A thousand pairs of eyes fix on me. In a world bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I feel like a fraud. All that matters is the dancing. I’m 15. An Irish accent lilts through the ballroom of the World Championships. It sounds like mashed potatoes and Sunday bests and the green hills of home that I know so well. We mutter a prayer. I’m not sure I believe in God, though I should. I look at my partner and wish we were more than friends. She smiles. I don’t think God believes in me. We ascend the stage. A million pairs of eyes fix on me. In a universe bustling with motion, everything stands still. It doesn’t matter that I’ll never be enough. All that matters is the dancing. I’ll be 18. Murmuring voices will hover in the air of the gymnasium-turned-cafeteria-turned-auditorium. A little girl will approach me timidly, wearing a very old tartan skirt. I’ll reach out softly, adjusting her bun to soothe her aching scalp. Then, I’ll slide my hands toward her feet, toward a pair of small, dusty shoes. “You’ll learn,” I’ll say. They’ll sag at the toes, but I’ll reassure her: “Don’t worry. You’ll grow into them.” Then, she and I will look at my own beloved shoes. They’ll be worn, but I’ll tell her the creases are like a map, evidence of the places I’ve been, the heartbreaks I’ve suffered, the joy I’ve danced. My life is in these shoes. We’ll hear the music begin to play, the tide of fiddles, and pipes, and drums. I’ll take her hand and, with a deep breath, we’ll climb the stage. “Ahd mor.” It won’t matter that this is the end.

At first, I was intimidated by the complex footwork and the intricate movements. But as I started to learn the steps, I realized that Irish dancing is more than just a series of steps. It is a form of self-expression, a way to tell a story through movement. One of my favorite things about Irish dancing is the way it connects me to my heritage.

They were light and flexible, allowing me to move with a grace and precision that I had never felt before. As I started to learn the steps and the rhythms of Irish dancing, I realized that there was something special about this art form. It wasn't just the way the music and the dance blended together, creating a harmonious whole. It was also the way that Irish dancing connected me to my heritage and my culture. Every time I danced, I felt like I was tapping into something deep and ancient, a rhythm that had been passed down through generations. The reels and jigs were like stories, each step a word in a language that only dancers could understand. And with every movement, I felt like I was honoring my ancestors and their traditions.

There were times when I felt like giving up, when the steps seemed too hard or the competition too fierce. But every time I faced a setback, I reminded myself of the resilience and perseverance that Irish dancing had taught me. One of the most memorable moments of my Irish dancing journey came during a particularly challenging competition. I had been practicing for months, putting in hours every day to perfect my steps and my routine. But on the day of the competition, everything seemed to go wrong. My shoes felt too tight, the stage was slippery, and I was nervous and jittery. As I stepped onto the stage, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest. But then something miraculous happened.

H,113,"The black void descends toward the young girl standing in the grassy field. It slowly creeps up on her, and as it reaches for her perfectly white dress … Swipe. I quickly wipe away the paint without a thought except for panic. Before I realize what I have done, the black droop becomes an ugly smear of black paint. The peaceful picture of the girl standing in the meadow is nowhere to be seen. Even though I successfully avoid having the spilled paint touch the dress, all I can focus on is the black smudge. The stupid black smudge. As I continue to stare at the enemy in front of me, I hear Bob Ross’s annoyingly cheerful voice in my head: “There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.” At this moment, I completely disagree. There is nothing happy about this, only frustration. Actually, there is one other emotion: excitement. Don’t get me wrong; I’m not excited about making a mistake and definitely not happy about the accident. But I am thrilled at the challenge. The black smudge is taunting me, challenging me to fix the painting that took me hours to do. It is my opponent, and I am not planning to back off, not planning to lose. Looking back at the painting, I refuse to see only the black smudge. If lacrosse has taught me one thing, it is that I will not be bested by my mistakes. I snatch my picture and run downstairs, carefully setting it against the living room window. The TV newscaster drones in the background, “California continues to be engulfed in flames as the fires continue to burn.” I slowly step back from my painting. California fires, I think, as I look up into the blood-orange sky. California Fires! I look at the painting, imagining the black smudge not as a black void, but smoke creeping up on the girl as she watches the meadow burn. I grab my painting and run back to my room. The orange sky casts eerie shadows as I throw open my blinds. My hands reach first toward the reds, oranges, and yellows: reds as rich as blood; oranges as beautiful as California poppies; yellows as bright as the sun. I splatter them on my palette, making a beautiful assortment of colors that reminds me of one thing: fire. A rich, beautiful, bright thing, but at the same time, dangerous. My hand levitates toward the white and black. White, my ally: peaceful, wonderful, simple white. Black, my enemy: annoying, frustrating, chaotic black. I splat both of them onto a different palette as I create different shades of gray. My brush first dips into red, orange, and yellow as I create the flame around the girl. The flame engulfs the meadow, each stroke of red covering the serene nature. Next is the smoke, I sponge the dull colors onto the canvas, hazing over the fire and the trees, and, most importantly, hiding the smudge. But it doesn’t work. It just looks like more blobs to cover the black smudge. What could make the gray paint turn into the hazy clouds that I have been experiencing for the past several days? I crack my knuckles in habit, and that’s when a new idea pops into my head. My calloused fingers dip into the cold, slimy gray paint, which slowly warms as I rub it between my fingers. My fingers descend onto the canvas, and as they brush against the fabric, I can feel the roughness of the dried paint as I add the new layer. As I work, the tension from my body releases.

C0,114,"Painting is an art form that has captivated humanity for centuries. From the prehistoric cave paintings to the contemporary works of art, painting has always been a powerful medium of expression. Growing up, I was always fascinated by paintings and the emotions they could evoke. However, it wasn't until I had the opportunity to explore the art of painting myself that I truly began to appreciate the complexity and beauty of this medium. As a child, I would often visit art galleries with my family, marveling at the intricate details and vivid colors of the paintings on display. I was particularly drawn to the works of the old masters, whose skillful use of light and shadow created a sense of depth and realism that was awe-inspiring. I would spend hours studying these paintings, trying to understand the techniques and brushstrokes used by the artists to create such beautiful works of art. Despite my fascination with painting, I never thought of pursuing it as a serious hobby or career until I stumbled upon an exhibition of abstract expressionist paintings. I was immediately struck by the bold colors and gestural brushstrokes of the paintings, which seemed to convey a raw and unfiltered emotion. It was as if the artists were using their canvases as a medium to express their innermost thoughts and feelings. Intrigued by this new form of painting, I decided to take up a class on abstract expressionism. Initially, I struggled with the lack of structure and guidelines that came with this style of painting. Unlike the realism paintings I had studied before, there was no clear subject matter or narrative to follow. Instead, I was encouraged to let my emotions guide my brushstrokes and create a painting that was a reflection of my inner self. At first, this was a daunting task. As a high school student, I was still figuring out who I was and what I stood for. How could I express my innermost thoughts and emotions on a canvas when I was still trying to figure them out myself? However, as I continued to paint, I realized that the act of painting itself was a form of self-discovery. Each brushstroke was a reflection of my mood and state of mind at that moment, and the resulting painting was a visual representation of my emotional journey. I found that the act of painting helped me to process my emotions and make sense of the world around me. When I was feeling overwhelmed or stressed, I would turn to my canvas and let my brushstrokes speak for me. The act of creating something beautiful out of chaos was a powerful and cathartic experience that helped me to find peace in the midst of turmoil. Through my journey with painting, I have come to appreciate the power of art as a medium of expression. Painting has taught me that there are many ways to communicate with the world, and that sometimes the most powerful messages are the ones that are left unsaid. By allowing my emotions to guide my brushstrokes, I have created works of art that are a reflection of my deepest thoughts and feelings, and that have resonated with others in ways I never could have imagined. In conclusion, painting has been a transformative experience that has helped me to find my voice and express myself in ways that words cannot. Through my exploration of abstract expressionism, I have discovered a new way of creating art that is both freeing and empowering. I believe that the act of painting has the power to heal, to inspire, and to connect people in ways that nothing else can.

C1,115,"As I stood in front of my canvas, I couldn't help but feel frustrated. My painting had been going well until I accidentally spilled black paint on it, creating an ugly smudge. I had spent hours working on it, and now it seemed ruined. However, as I stared at the black smudge, I remembered the words of Bob Ross: 'There are no mistakes, only happy accidents.' While I didn't believe him at the time, I realized that this could be an opportunity to turn my mistake into something beautiful. Instead of focusing on the smudge, I decided to use it as a starting point for a new painting. I imagined the smudge as smoke creeping up on a meadow, and I began to recreate the scene in my mind. As I looked outside my window, I noticed the blood-orange sky caused by the California fires. I decided to use this as inspiration and incorporate the colors into my painting. I gathered my materials and began to paint the flames around the meadow, using reds, oranges, and yellows. I then added the smoke, using different shades of gray to create a hazy effect. But something wasn't quite right - the gray paint looked like blobs on my canvas instead of the hazy clouds I was envisioning. As I pondered how to fix this issue, I cracked my knuckles and an idea popped into my head. I dipped my fingers into the gray paint and began to rub it between them. I then used my fingers to add the gray paint to the canvas, feeling the rough texture of the dried paint as I worked. With each stroke of my fingers, the blobs on the canvas transformed into the hazy clouds I had been imagining. As I stepped back and looked at my finished painting, I realized that my mistake had led me to create something even more beautiful than what I had originally planned. My frustration had turned into excitement and satisfaction as I overcame the challenge of fixing my mistake. Through this experience, I learned the power of perseverance and the importance of seeing mistakes as opportunities rather than setbacks. Painting has taught me to embrace imperfection and to find beauty in unexpected places. It has given me a new way to express myself and to connect with others on a deeper level. As I look towards my future, I am excited to continue exploring the world of painting and to see where this journey takes me.

The room was silent except for the sound of the bristles against the canvas as I made the first mark.

It had started as a simple fascination with the works of the old masters, but it had evolved into something more profound. Painting had become a medium for me to express myself and to connect with others on a deeper level. I thought about the people in my life who had influenced me the most, and my mind settled on my grandfather. My grandfather had always been a resilient man. He had faced many challenges throughout his life but had never let them break him. I wanted to capture that resilience on my canvas. I thought about the colors and textures that would represent his strength, the sounds and smells that would embody his determination. I started with a deep blue, representing the hardships that my grandfather had faced in his life. I added in some greens, symbolizing the growth that had come from those challenges. As I worked, I noticed the texture of the canvas, rough and uneven, reminding me of the obstacles my grandfather had overcome. The sound of the bristles against the canvas echoed through the silent room, a testament to my own determination to capture his resilience. Next, I added in some yellows and oranges, representing the hope that my grandfather always held onto, even in the darkest of times. The canvas began to come alive with colors and textures, each stroke of the brush symbolizing a different aspect of his strength. As I stepped back to admire my work, I noticed the smell of the oil paints, a comforting scent that reminded me of my grandfather's studio. The canvas was filled with symbolism, representing the challenges, growth, and hope that had shaped my grandfather's life and had inspired me to pursue painting. Through this painting, I had found a new way to connect with my grandfather and to honor his legacy. It had also reminded me of the power of art as a medium of expression and the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity. As I put down my brush, I realized that the canvas wasn't just a reflection of my grandfather's resilience, but of my own as well. I had faced many challenges in my life, but like my grandfather, I had always found a way to overcome them. Through painting, I had found a way to express my own strength and to connect with others who shared that same resilience. In conclusion, painting has become a powerful tool for me to express myself and to connect with the world around me. Through the use of vivid sensory details and symbolism, I have been able to capture the essence of the people who have influenced me the most and to create works of art that are a reflection of my own inner journey. Painting has taught me that the journey is just as important as the destination and that the process of creation is a deeply personal and rewarding experience.",0,2.788569391,2.894145914,3.103310955,3.245234013,3.026511303,17.4,21.0,22.0,24.8,21.0
H,117,"On the day my first novel was rejected, I was baking pies. Or rather, I was gathering the necessary stamina for our church’s annual pie sale. Ten hours of rolling crusts and peeling apples and kneading butter and sugar into the crumble topping, all the while drowning in the cinnamon air, surrounded by near-literal mountains of pies that we were forbidden to touch. (It was, I think, our pastor’s method of drilling the meaning of temptation into heads — he always preached about Eden the following Sunday.) I sat on my couch and counted the minutes until the agony of pie-making, (almost) forgetting the novel that was currently with the acquisitions board of one of the biggest publishing houses in the world. Amy ZhangTo be fair, I hadn’t known that the acquisitions meeting would be held that day. I did know that two — two! — senior editors wanted to make all of my impossible dreams come true. I knew that the marketing and sales people had already looked over my manuscript — something that usually happened post-contract. I knew the meeting had been pushed back twice already by an unsympathetic hurricane that had left downtown Manhattan under several feet of water. I knew this was it. This had to be it. It was my turn. I had slogged through the query trenches in search of an agent. I had collected enough rejection letters to wallpaper my room. I had found an agent who hadn’t run away when I finally told her that I was 15, who loved my story almost as much as I did, who submitted it and lured two — two! — senior editors to take a risk on it. Hello, future? I’m ready for my happily ever after. Love, Amy. Phone call from my agent. Sweaty palms and dizziness, a tap of a shaking finger to a smudged screen. Small talk and stalling. A sigh and, at last, the news, that the publisher had a similar novel on her list and vetoed the editors. That there was no heat in the flooded building and they had rejected everything and had gone home early. Stomach in throat, swallow. False laugh, assurances of next time. End call. Tears. Hello, Amy? Sucks, doesn’t it? Love, the future. It sucked so monumentally that I bought a pie and ate it in one sitting. It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay. I fell asleep like that: okay, okay, okay, and I almost believed it. After all, the next day was the beginning of National Novel Writing Month. I had an outline and a story to tell: one of imaginary friends, Newton’s Laws of Motion, a car out of control, a crash into a tree. Okay, okay, okay. A ringing in the ungodly hours of morning. Phone call from a friend. Bleary eyes and words still spinning: okay, okay, okay. A mumbled what the heck? in place of a greeting, another hurricane in the answer. A classmate, a car out of control, a crash into a tree. We used to have gym together, I didn’t know him too well, and I never would. Those were the facts — no opinions, no emotions I could translate into ink on a page, touch, understand. The words were gone. I sat at my computer with my fingers on the keys, shaking, sweating, smudging, but there was nothing to say. Everyone went to the memorial service and everyone brought flowers, and in the silence, we cried. And there was anger, too, later — a bursting, a hush that imploded. I went home after the service and threw my laptop open and wrote about all that was unfair, and there was a lot to write about. The month passed, and I won NaNoWriMo. I revised the novel and sent it to my agent who began the submission process once again. It sold in three days. Hello, future? I’m not afraid.

C0,118,"It was the summer before my senior year of high school when I received the email that shattered my dreams. After months of tirelessly writing and editing, I finally submitted my first novel to a well-known publishing house. The excitement and anticipation I felt were overwhelming, and I eagerly awaited their response. But when I opened the email, the words stared back at me, cold and unfeeling: 'Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward with your book.' The rejection was devastating. My mind swirled with self-doubt and disappointment. I had poured my heart and soul into that novel, and it felt like all my hard work had been for nothing. I wondered if I was even cut out for writing, or if I should give up on my dream altogether. But after a few days of wallowing in self-pity, I decided to take a different approach. Instead of giving up, I resolved to use the rejection as fuel for my next project. I was determined to write something even better, something that would prove the publisher wrong and show them what I was truly capable of. So, I threw myself into my writing with renewed vigor. I researched more extensively, plotted more carefully, and wrote more passionately than I ever had before. I poured my heart and soul into my new novel, determined to make it the best it could be. Months passed, and I finally finished the manuscript. But this time, I wasn't as eager to send it off. The rejection from my first novel still stung, and I was afraid of being rejected again. But I knew that I couldn't let fear hold me back. So, I took a deep breath and hit 'send.' And then, I waited. The waiting was excruciating. Every time my phone pinged with a new email, my heart skipped a beat. But days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months, and still, I heard nothing. Just when I had given up hope, I received an email from the publisher. My heart raced as I opened it, praying for good news. 'Congratulations,' the email began. 'We loved your manuscript and are thrilled to offer you a publishing contract.' I couldn't believe it. After all the rejection and self-doubt, I had finally done it. My novel was going to be published. Looking back, I realize that the rejection I faced with my first novel was a blessing in disguise. It forced me to reevaluate my writing, to push myself harder and further than I ever had before. And in doing so, I discovered that I was capable of so much more than I had ever imagined. The experience taught me that rejection is not the end of the road, but rather a bump along the way. It's easy to get discouraged when things don't go as planned, but it's important to keep pushing forward, to keep striving for success. I also learned that the writing process is a journey, and each rejection and acceptance is a step along the way. It's easy to get caught up in the end goal of publication, but it's the journey itself that truly matters. Each rejection and acceptance is an opportunity to grow and improve as a writer, to learn from our mistakes and build upon our successes. In the end, getting my first novel rejected and then accepted was a life-changing experience. It taught me resilience, perseverance, and the power of self-belief. It showed me that success is not a destination, but a journey, and that with hard work and determination, anything is possible.

I had already prepared myself for the worst, but reading the words 'Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward with your book' still stung. At first, I was crushed. I felt like a failure, and the rejection made me question my abilities as a writer. But then, I remembered why I started writing in the first place. It wasn't for the fame or fortune; it was because I loved telling stories. I had always been drawn to the power of words and the way they could transport readers to different worlds and make them feel things they never thought possible. So, I decided to use the rejection as motivation. I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of writing something even better, something that would be impossible for any publisher to reject. I threw myself into my writing, pushing myself to be better and working harder than I ever had before. I researched more extensively, plotted more carefully, and wrote more passionately.

C2,120,"The day I received the email rejecting my first novel was a scorching summer day. The sun beat down on me through the window, casting a harsh glare on my computer screen. I sat at my desk, staring at the email, my heart racing, and my palms sweating. The rejection felt like a heavy weight on my chest, suffocating me. I felt like I had poured my heart and soul into that manuscript, and now it was all for nothing. The story was set in a small town, surrounded by lush green forests that whispered secrets in the breeze. I had spent countless hours researching and writing, trying to capture the essence of the town and its people. But the rejection made me doubt everything. Doubt myself, doubt my writing, and doubt the story I had poured so much into. I felt like I had failed, and the more I thought about it, the more my mind spun into a vortex of self-pity and disappointment. But then, a new thought entered my mind. Maybe the rejection was just the beginning. Perhaps it was an opportunity to grow and improve as a writer. A chance to hone my craft and tell a story that was even more captivating and engaging. I decided to take a break from writing and step outside. The air was thick and humid, and the sweet smell of freshly cut grass mixed with the earthy aroma of the forest. I sat on the porch, letting the sun beat down on my face, and listened to the sounds of the world around me. The chirping of crickets, the rustling of leaves in the wind, the distant hum of traffic from the nearby highway. It was then that I realized that the story I wanted to tell was not just about the town, but about the people who lived there. The town was a symbol of resilience, a place where people came together to help each other through tough times. It was a place where the beauty of nature and the strength of the human spirit intertwined. I went back to my writing with renewed energy, determined to tell the story of the town and its people. I poured my heart and soul into every page, trying to capture the sights, sounds, and emotions of the town. As the days passed, I found myself becoming more and more immersed in the story. The characters came to life, each one representing a different facet of the town's resilience. There was the elderly couple who had survived a devastating flood, the young mother who had lost her husband in a car accident, and the high school student who had overcome bullying to become a successful athlete. Each character had their own story, their own struggles, and their own triumphs. And as I wrote, I realized that their stories were not just about resilience, but about the human spirit. About the strength we all have within us to overcome adversity and rise above our circumstances. Finally, I finished the manuscript and submitted it to the same publishing house. The waiting was agonizing, but this time I was prepared. I had poured everything into this story, and I knew that no matter the outcome, I had done my best. When the email arrived, I hesitated before opening it. But this time, the message was different. 'Congratulations,' it read. 'We loved your manuscript and are thrilled to offer you a publishing contract.' Tears streamed down my face as I read the words. This time, the rejection had led me to something even greater. It had pushed me to be a better writer, to tell a more compelling story, and to believe in myself. Looking back, I realized that the rejection was not just a setback, but a stepping stone. It had forced me to dig deeper, to find the heart of the story, and to tell it in a way that resonated with readers.

H,121,"Walking down a busy street, I see the quick glances and turned heads. The murmurs and giggles trickle toward me. I try to ignore the buzz, interspersed with, “Oh my God!” and the occasional, “Damn!” Then, a complete stranger asks for a picture, so I stand with people foreign to me and politely smile and laugh. After the click of the camera, they go on their way. Sometimes I wish I weren’t so tall. Maybe then I could take a friend to a movie and just blend into the crowd. Attention from strangers is nothing new to me. Questions about my height dominate almost every public interaction. My friends say my height is just a physical quality and not a personality trait. However, when I reflect on my life, I realize that my height has shaped my character in many ways and has helped to define the person I am. I learned how to be comfortable in my own skin. If I had the introverted personality my older brother had in high school, I’d probably be overwhelmed by the constant public attention. Even as a young child, parents at the sidelines of my baseball games, as well as the umpire, would, in front of all my teammates, demand by birth certificate to prove my age. I grew acquainted early on with the fact that I am abnormally tall and stick out about the crowd. It’s just the way it is. Being self-conscious about it would be paralyzing. I learned how to be kind. When I was younger, some parents in my neighborhood deemed me a bully because I was so much larger than children my age. I had to be extra welcoming and gentle simply to play with other children. Of course, now my coaches wish I weren’t quite so kind on the basketball court. Even More Essays That WorkdI learned humility. At 7 feet tall, everyone expects me to be an amazing basketball player. They come expecting to see Dirk Nowitzki, and instead they might see a performance more like Will Ferrell in Semi-Pro. I have learned to be humble and to work even harder than my peers to meet their (and my) expectations. I developed a sense of lightheartedness. When people playfully make fun of my height, I laugh at myself too. On my first day of high school, a girl dropped her books in a busy hallway. I crouched down to her level and gathered some of her notebooks. As we both stood up, her eyes widened as I kept rising over her. Dumbfounded, she dropped her books again. Embarrassed, we both laughed and picked up the books a second time. All of these lessons have defined me. People unfamiliar to me have always wanted to engage me in lengthy conversations, so I have had to become comfortable interacting with all kinds of people. Looking back, I realize that through years of such encounters, I have become a confident, articulate person. Being a 7-footer is both a blessing and a curse, but in the end, accepting who you are is the first step to happiness.",1,2.145912853,2.413943373,2.643149899,2.883883134,2.508351917,7.0,12.0,15.0,20.4,13.0
C0,122,"As I tower over my classmates at 7 feet tall, I've learned to embrace my height and the unique perspective it brings to my life. Being tall has shaped my experiences in ways I never could have predicted, and has ultimately taught me invaluable lessons about identity, acceptance, and the power of individuality. Growing up, I was always the tallest kid in my class. At first, I reveled in the attention, relishing the way my height made me stand out. But as I got older, I began to realize that being tall was not always an advantage. In a world that is designed for people of average height, everyday tasks like finding clothes that fit or navigating crowded spaces became more challenging for me. I was forced to adapt, to learn how to make my way in a world that wasn't always built for someone like me. But even as I encountered obstacles, I never lost sight of the unique perspective my height gave me. Being tall allowed me to see the world from a different angle, to notice details and patterns that others might miss. When I looked out at the world from my lofty vantage point, I saw things in a way that was both humbling and awe-inspiring. I began to understand that my height was not just a physical characteristic, but a lens through which I could view the world in a way that was entirely my own. As I started to embrace my identity as a tall person, I also began to think about the ways in which society values conformity over individuality. We are taught to blend in, to conform to the norms and expectations of those around us. But in doing so, we risk losing sight of what makes us unique. As a tall person, I couldn't help but stand out, and in doing so, I found a freedom that I'm not sure I would have discovered otherwise. But it wasn't just my physical height that set me apart. As I began to think more deeply about what it meant to be different, I realized that everyone has something that makes them unique. Whether it's a physical characteristic, a personality trait, or a set of experiences, we all have something that sets us apart from the crowd. And yet, so often we are taught to hide these differences, to pretend that we are just like everyone else. But what if we embraced our individuality instead? What if we celebrated the things that made us different? This realization was a turning point for me. As I embraced my own uniqueness, I began to see the world in a new way. I began to appreciate the ways in which we are all connected, despite our differences. I saw that diversity is not just something to be tolerated, but something to be celebrated. And I realized that by being true to ourselves, we can inspire others to do the same. As I look ahead to the future, I am excited to bring this perspective with me to college and beyond. I know that being tall will continue to shape my experiences, but I am eager to see how it will intersect with the other aspects of my identity. I am excited to meet people who are different from me, to learn from their experiences, and to share my own. And I am committed to using my voice to promote acceptance, diversity, and individuality. In the end, being 7 feet tall has taught me that there is power in being different. It has shown me that by embracing our individuality, we can find a sense of freedom and purpose that is impossible to find when we conform to the expectations of others. And it has reminded me that no matter who we are or where we come from, we all have something valuable to offer. I am proud to be tall, and I am excited to see where this unique perspective will take me in the years to come.

C1,123,"As I walk down the street, towering above the crowd at 7 feet tall, I am no stranger to the attention and curiosity of strangers. At times, I find myself wishing I could blend in, take a friend to a movie without causing a stir. But as I reflect on my life, I realize that my height has shaped my character in profound ways, helping me to become the person I am today. First and foremost, my height has taught me the importance of self-acceptance. From a young age, I was acutely aware of how different I was from my peers. At school, parents would demand to see my birth certificate to prove my age, and strangers would approach me on the street just to take a picture. But over time, I learned to embrace my height as a part of who I am, rather than something to be ashamed of. This self-acceptance has given me a sense of confidence and assurance that I carry with me to this day. In addition to self-acceptance, my height has also taught me valuable lessons about kindness and humility. As a child, I was often perceived as a bully simply because of my size, so I had to work extra hard to show my peers that I was approachable and gentle. Later, when I began playing basketball, I quickly realized that my height did not automatically make me a star player. I had to work harder than my peers to improve my skills and meet the expectations of others. These experiences have taught me the importance of kindness, hard work, and humility, and have helped me to develop a strong sense of empathy and compassion for others. Perhaps most importantly, my height has given me a unique perspective on the world around me. From my vantage point, I can see things that others might miss, noticing details and patterns that might otherwise go unnoticed. This perspective has taught me the value of individuality and the power of diversity. Just as my height sets me apart from others, we all have something that makes us unique, whether it's a physical characteristic, a personality trait, or a set of experiences. By embracing our individuality and celebrating our differences, we can create a world that is more compassionate, more inclusive, and more understanding. Of course, being 7 feet tall is not without its challenges. Finding clothes that fit, navigating crowded spaces, and even just blending in can be difficult at times. But these challenges have also taught me the importance of adaptability and resilience. I have had to learn how to make my way in a world that wasn't always built for someone like me, and in doing so, I have become more creative, more resourceful, and more determined. As I look ahead to the future, I am excited to see how my height will continue to shape my experiences and my perspective. I am eager to meet people who are different from me, to learn from their experiences, and to share my own. And I am committed to using my voice to promote acceptance, diversity, and individuality, both on and off the basketball court. In conclusion, being 7 feet tall has taught me invaluable lessons about self-acceptance, kindness, humility, and the power of individuality.

C2,124,"As I walk down the street, the sound of my footsteps echoes off the pavement, a steady rhythm that seems to draw attention from every passerby. I can feel the weight of their stares, like a physical pressure against my skin. It's not just the length of my body that sets me apart, it's the way people react to it - the awe, the curiosity, the occasional laughter. Sometimes, I feel like I'm living in a different world than everyone else. The world of the tall, where everything is just a little bit bigger and a little bit louder. It's a world of oversized door frames and low ceilings, where chairs seem designed for children and finding clothes that fit is a constant challenge. But it's also a world of endless possibility, a world where every space feels like a wide-open expanse waiting to be explored. It's easy to feel isolated in this world, to feel like no one can truly understand what it's like to be me. But then I think about the people in my life who have shown me what resilience truly means. People like my grandfather, who grew up in poverty and fought his way to a successful career, or my friend who overcame a serious illness with a determination that still takes my breath away. These are the people who remind me that being tall is just one part of who I am, and that my experiences are not unique. But even as I strive to find common ground with others, I can't help but feel the pull of the world of the tall. It's a world of visual cues - the way people's eyes widen when they first see me, the way they instinctively look up when they talk to me. It's a world of sensory experiences - the feel of a door frame scraping against the top of my head, the smell of freshly cut grass that seems more pungent from up high. And it's a world of symbolism, of the way being tall represents something larger than myself, something that sets me apart but also connects me to a long line of people who have stood out from the crowd. I think about the way the world of the tall has shaped my experiences, the way it has taught me to be adaptable and resilient in the face of challenges. I remember the time I had to climb onto a chair just to reach the microphone at a conference, or the way I had to learn to duck my head instinctively every time I walked through a doorway. These are the moments that have taught me to be patient and creative, to find solutions where others might see only obstacles. But I also think about the moments of joy, the moments when being tall has brought a sense of liberation and freedom. Like the time I stood on the beach at sunset, watching the waves crash against the shore as the breeze ruffled my hair. Or the time I stood in a crowded club, looking out over the throng of people dancing below me like a sea of colorful, pulsing bodies. In these moments, being tall feels less like a burden and more like a gift, a way of seeing the world that is uniquely my own. In the end, being 7 feet tall is just one part of who I am, but it's a part that I have learned to embrace and celebrate. It's a world of sensory experiences and symbolic resonance, a world that has taught me valuable lessons about resilience and adaptability.

H,125,"I am here because my great-grandfather tied his shoelace. It was World War I, and he was a Montenegrin fighting in the American army in France. His fellow soldiers surged across the field, but he paused for the briefest of moments because his laces had come undone. Those ahead of him were blown to bits. Years later, as Montenegro was facing a civil war, the communists came to his home. His village was small, and he knew the men who knocked on his door. But this familiarity meant nothing, for when they saw him they thought of the word America, stamped across a land where the poor were stripped of their rights and where the fierce and volatile Balkan temper would not do. As his neighbors ransacked his home, his wife had thrust his good pair of shoes at him. “Take them,” she had urged. “Wear them.” Tara CicicBut he did not, for he knew that he could not run. I also cannot run, but I wear my new shoes with great ease and comfort. I wear the secret guilt, the belief in equality, the obsession with culture, and the worship of rational thinking and education that becomes the certain kind of American that I am. None of these things are costumes. I believe in and feel them all sincerely, but they are not who I am. They may be a part, but I can say with certainty that they are not all. I was born in Belgrade and Serbian was my first language, but these things seem nearly inconsequential when compared to the number of years that I’ve spent in America and the fact that English is by far my superior tongue. We visit every two or three years or so. Everybody is there, my entire collection of cousins and aunts and grandparents neatly totted up in a scattering of villages and cities, arms open with the promise of a few sneaky sips of rakia and bites of kajmak. I love them, I truly do. I love the flat roof on my grandparents’ home, the familiar sounds of the cicadas, the cows that they had when I was 7, and even the goats that I have not met yet. But they are not me, those things. They are something else. Take a few bounds away from my immediate family, and I do not know anyone’s names. Somebody is always falling ill, or drinking too much, or making trouble for themselves. We speak of them sometimes, or pity them, but we do not go to their weddings or funerals. And yet I feel worried, not for them, but for myself. The Serbs and Montenegrins are people of complicated histories, and as I watch the documentaries my father made during the civil war there, I am gripped with fear and fascination. Those strange people can be so hateful. They cry and beat their hearts at the thought of Serbian loss in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389. This kind of nationalism makes me cringe. I do not want to be that way. But is there not something beautiful in that kind of passion and emotion? What does it say of me that I sometimes cannot help but romanticize something I know to be destructive and oppressive? This is why I worry. They are not me, I tell myself, and I am right. But can they not be just a part? Can they not be a tiny sliver, or maybe even a sizeable chunk, comparable even to the American in me? Must I relegate them to nothing at all? For if those shoes, the ones my grandfather bent to tie in the middle of that blazing battlefield in France, are not mine, then why do I think of them so often?",1,1.802275182,2.152568012,2.637510704,3.325810932,2.383719358,7.6,11.4,15.8,21.0,15.0
C0,126,"I am Serbian-American. That’s a phrase that not many people understand. Even as a high school senior, I’ve had to explain to friends and acquaintances what being Serbian means, and why it’s important to me. For me, being Serbian-American means that I have a rich cultural heritage that I carry with me every day. It means that I speak a language that is not widely spoken in the United States, and that I have family in a country that is not always well-understood by Americans. It also means that I have a unique perspective on the world that has shaped me into the person I am today. Growing up in a Serbian household, I was immersed in the culture from a young age. My parents taught me to speak Serbian before I even learned English, and I spent countless hours listening to Serbian folk music and eating traditional Serbian dishes. I learned the importance of family, loyalty, and hard work, values that have shaped my character and influenced my decision-making. However, being Serbian-American also means that I have had to navigate some difficult experiences. When I was in elementary school, for example, I remember being teased for bringing traditional Serbian food to school for lunch. My classmates didn’t understand the food or the culture, and they made fun of me for being different. At the time, I was embarrassed and ashamed of my heritage. But looking back, I realize that those experiences taught me the importance of standing up for myself and my culture, and they helped me to develop a sense of resilience that has served me well in other areas of my life. One of the most significant ways that being Serbian-American has influenced my worldview is through my understanding of history. Serbia has a complex and often difficult history, with periods of war, occupation, and political turmoil. As a result, Serbians are deeply invested in their national identity, and they have a keen awareness of the importance of preserving their culture and traditions. Growing up, I learned about the struggles that my ancestors faced and the sacrifices that they made to maintain their way of life. This history has instilled in me a sense of pride and a commitment to preserving the best parts of my culture. At the same time, being Serbian-American has also taught me the importance of finding common ground with others. In today’s world, it can be all too easy to focus on what divides us rather than what unites us. However, as a member of a minority culture, I have come to appreciate the value of finding common ground with others, even if we come from different backgrounds. I’ve learned that by emphasizing our shared humanity, we can build bridges and find ways to work together to make the world a better place. As I look ahead to my future, I am eager to continue exploring my Serbian heritage and sharing it with others. Whether I end up pursuing a career in law, medicine, or another field entirely, I know that my experiences as a Serbian-American will continue to shape my perspective and influence my decisions. I hope to be an ambassador for my culture and to help others understand the richness and complexity of the Serbian experience. In conclusion, being Serbian-American has given me a unique perspective on the world that has shaped me in profound ways. It has taught me the importance of resilience, pride, and finding common ground with others. As I move forward in life, I am excited to continue exploring my heritage and sharing it with others. I believe that my experiences as a Serbian-American have prepared me well for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and I am eager to see where my journey will take me.",0,2.732156148,2.887462462,3.062396752,3.30287685,3.024240898,16.0,19.6,21.4,26.2,20.5
C1,127,"My Serbian-American heritage has shaped me in profound ways. From the language I speak to the food I eat, my culture is an essential part of my identity. However, it has also presented challenges that have shaped my worldview. My great-grandfather's story is a reminder of the sacrifices my family has made for the American dream. He survived World War I by tying his shoelace, but later faced persecution during Montenegro's civil war for his ties to America. The guilt, belief in equality, obsession with culture, and worship of rational thinking and education that he embodied have become a part of me, but they are not all of me. I am an American, but I am also a Serbian. My first language was Serbian, and I was born in Belgrade, but my American upbringing has made English my superior tongue. While I love my family and heritage, I also feel disconnected from them. Beyond my immediate family, I do not know anyone's names in my extended family. They are familiar, but not who I am. Watching documentaries about the complicated history of the Balkans during the civil war, I feel both fear and fascination. The strong nationalism and emotion of the Serbs and Montenegrins make me cringe, but I cannot help but romanticize it. It is a reminder that my heritage is not all good or all bad, but a complex mix of both. As a Serbian-American, I feel a responsibility to represent my culture and heritage. I want to preserve the best parts of my culture while acknowledging its flaws. I want to find common ground with others, regardless of their background, and build bridges between cultures. In the end, my Serbian-American heritage has given me a unique perspective on the world that has shaped me in profound ways. It has taught me the importance of preserving culture, finding common ground with others, and acknowledging both the good and bad in my heritage. While my American upbringing may have made me feel disconnected from my Serbian roots, it has also given me the tools to navigate the world as a global citizen with a deep appreciation for different cultures.",0,2.607957664,2.783838592,2.999396579,3.294093297,2.820542705,12.6,15.8,19.4,22.0,18.0
C2,128,"As I sit down to write about my Serbian-American heritage, the scent of roasting peppers fills the air. My mother is in the kitchen, carefully charring the peppers over an open flame before peeling off their blackened skins. It's a traditional Serbian dish called ajvar, and the smell takes me back to my childhood, where I spent countless hours watching my mother cook and listening to her stories about life in Serbia. My great-grandfather's story is one that has always stuck with me. He survived World War I by pausing to tie his shoelace, but later faced persecution during Montenegro's civil war for his ties to America. His story symbolizes the resilience and determination that I have seen in many Serbian-Americans throughout my life. One of the most resilient people in my life was my grandfather. He grew up in a small village in Serbia and immigrated to the United States in his 20s, where he worked tirelessly to provide for his family. Despite facing numerous obstacles and setbacks, he never lost sight of his goals or his commitment to his family. I remember spending summers at his house, where we would pick fresh berries from the garden and make homemade jams. His hands were calloused from years of hard work, but they were also gentle as he taught me the importance of taking pride in my heritage. As a Serbian-American, I have learned the importance of finding common ground with others, even in the face of adversity. I have seen this firsthand in the way that my family has come together to support one another during difficult times. When my aunt was diagnosed with cancer, my entire family rallied around her, offering support and love. We cooked meals, drove her to appointments, and held her hand when she needed it most. It was a reminder that no matter what our differences may be, we are all human and we all need love and support. Growing up, I felt a sense of pride in my Serbian heritage, but I also struggled to balance it with my American identity. When I was in middle school, I remember feeling embarrassed about bringing traditional Serbian food to school for lunch. My classmates didn't understand the food or the culture, and I felt like an outsider. But over time, I came to appreciate the uniqueness of my culture and the importance of preserving it. One of my favorite memories is from a family trip to Serbia when I was a teenager. We spent a day exploring the stunning monasteries and churches of the region, admiring the intricate frescoes and icons. As we drove through the countryside, we saw the remnants of war-torn buildings and homes, a stark reminder of the country's complicated history. But despite the scars of the past, there was a sense of hope and resilience that permeated the air. As I reflect on my Serbian-American heritage, I am filled with gratitude for the lessons that it has taught me. It has taught me the importance of resilience, determination, and finding common ground with others. It has taught me the value of family, hard work, and taking pride in one's heritage. And most importantly, it has taught me that no matter where we come from or what our backgrounds may be, we are all connected as human beings.

H,129,"My head was spinning, my hands were bleeding, and my lungs desperately needed more air. The air was filled with the shouts of men dying and steel clashing with steel. To my left were two young men, no more than 18 years old, at each other’s throats. To my right an old man lay dead, missing an arm. My men were pouring out of the breach in full retreat. Death surrounded me as I summoned every ounce of my courage and shouted out that desperate ultimatum to my dying brethren, “Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more, or close the wall up with our English dead!” Then reality came crashing down. “No, no you’re doing it all wrong.” I blinked, and instead of a bloody battlefield in front of me there was nothing more than a nearly empty auditorium. The sole occupant of the auditorium was a tall, bald, British man with a terrifyingly condescending demeanor. He was my Shakespeare coach. The most minuscule mistake never escaped his notice. “There’s no chance in hell I would ever fight for you,” he said. “Do it again.” I went offstage and tried to repaint the picture. I emerged inflamed with the drive for victory. Every word I uttered was a strike against the French. Every heartfelt delivery of that carefully choreographed routine was ground gained at Harfluer. I fought passionately with that ancient text, but my coach cut me off again. “OK, better, maybe I would fight for you, but I wouldn’t die for you. C’mon pump me up, show me you care. Do it again.” I tried again. I put forth all my effort, but again he stopped me. I performed it countless times over, but with each rendition the quality exponentially worsened. Finally, he told me to stop. We had done all we could for today. Tommy Bowden Essay IllustrationI stepped off stage and collapsed into a chair, angry and defeated. Reaching into my pocket, I found the small rectangular magnet that had been given to me by the head of the theatre department for “motivational purposes.” On the right side of the memento there was an ornate picture of The Bard in all his glory, and on the left there were six simple words: “To thine own self be true.” I knew why I was here. I was here to prove to myself that I could accomplish something momentous. I was born with two speech impediments. I was a shy kid, with a crooked smile, who couldn’t pronounce any words correctly. Participating in theatre was the last thing anyone expected of me. Yet I wanted to sway crowds with my voice, make them cry, laugh and shout for joy. I was a terrified 10-year-old the first time I stepped on stage, and equally frightened moments before I finally performed at Lincoln Center. I walked slowly to my position full of fear, but when the spotlight hit my face, there was no trepidation, only a calmness and quiet determination. In that moment all the long hours of struggle fell into place. I had already accomplished what I had set out to do before my final performance. Just being there, having worked as hard as I had, made all the worry dissipate. It was just me and the light. In that earlier moment of failure, I couldn’t see that light, or even imagine it. My brain was in a fog; I couldn’t think. As I sat there and the lights in the theatre clicked off one by one, the setting sun cast a beam of orange sunlight directly center stage. I pretended to watch myself perform in that light, pacing to and fro, shouting heroically to my men and charging headlong into battle, into victory. I looked back down at the memento. Then something clicked. Henry V never lost hope and neither would I. So I went once more to the stage.",1,2.117244558,2.375689091,2.634607763,2.910932431,2.475198671,8.0,11.0,14.0,17.0,13.0
C0,130,"As a child, I struggled to be heard. I was born with a speech impediment that made it difficult for others to understand me. I often felt invisible, like my voice was not important enough to be heard. But everything changed when I discovered Shakespeare. My first encounter with Shakespeare was in a high school English class. My teacher was passionate about the Bard's work and encouraged us to read aloud in class. I was hesitant at first, but something about the language spoke to me. I found myself drawn to the rhythms and cadences of his words, and soon I was reciting entire passages from memory. It was through Shakespeare that I found my voice. Despite my speech impediment, I was able to master the intricacies of his language and perform it with confidence. In a way, Shakespeare became my own personal speech therapy. There is something about the way Shakespeare writes that transcends language. His words are a powerful tool for communication, allowing me to express myself in ways that I never thought possible. When I speak Shakespeare's words, my stutter disappears and my confidence soars. I remember the first time I performed a Shakespearean monologue in front of an audience. It was a nerve-wracking experience, but as soon as I began to speak, I was transported into another world. The words flowed effortlessly from my mouth, and for a moment, I felt like a true actor. It was during this performance that I realized the true power of Shakespeare's language. Through his words, I was able to connect with the audience on a deeper level. I was able to share my emotions and experiences in a way that transcended my speech impediment.

C2,132,"I stood nervously backstage, my hands shaking as I clutched the crinkled pages of my script. The smell of freshly applied stage makeup filled the air, and the sound of murmured conversations echoed through the dimly lit corridor. My heart raced as I waited for my cue, the anticipation nearly overwhelming. As I stepped onto the stage, the bright lights blinded me momentarily. I took a deep breath and began reciting my lines, the words of Shakespeare flowing from my lips with ease. The audience was silent, their attention focused solely on me. It was through the language of Shakespeare that I found my voice. As a child with a speech impediment, I often felt invisible, like my voice was not important enough to be heard. But when I spoke Shakespeare's words, I felt powerful and in control. I remember the first time I performed a Shakespearean monologue in front of an audience. The stage was set with a simple wooden chair and a single spotlight. The room was filled with the scent of musty curtains, and the only sound was the occasional creak of the floorboards beneath my feet. As I began to speak, I could feel the weight of the language on my tongue. The rhythm of the words flowed through me like a heartbeat, and I felt a sense of liberation as I was able to communicate with the audience in a way that transcended my speech impediment. In that moment, I felt a connection to the audience that I had never felt before. The power of language had given me a voice, and I was able to connect with them in a way that was both intimate and profound. Through my experience with Shakespeare, I learned the importance of perseverance and hard work. I would spend hours memorizing lines, practicing pronunciation, and analyzing the meaning behind each word. It was a labor of love, but one that was well worth it. There were times when I felt like giving up, like the words were too difficult to pronounce or the meaning too elusive. But I persisted, and through that persistence, I found a resilience that I never knew I had. There was one moment in particular that stands out in my memory. I was rehearsing a particularly difficult monologue, and no matter how many times I recited it, I just couldn't get the words to flow correctly. My Shakespeare coach was there with me, encouraging me every step of the way. He could see the frustration in my eyes, and he knew just what to say to keep me going. 'It's not about getting it perfect,' he said. 'It's about the journey, the process of getting there.' Those words stuck with me, and I continued to practice with renewed determination. And finally, after what seemed like an eternity, the words began to flow effortlessly from my mouth.

H,133,"Keeping my head down and avoiding eye contact, I tried not to attract attention. Drunken shrieks and moans reverberated through the darkening light of the bus stop, while silhouettes and shadows danced about. My heart pounding, I hoped I would survive the next 40 minutes. I had never seen the homeless at the stop act so deranged. But I had never been there so late. It was well past sundown. A man passed out on the next bench awoke only to shout and drink. One screamed racial slurs and curses at another while they both staggered around. Another lacked an arm and had the most baleful gaze I had ever seen. As much as I tried to empathize and feel compassion, I couldn’t stymie a feeling of terror and revulsion. After a few long minutes, a shadow detached itself from the opposite benches, came over and sat down next to me. Squinting, I took in her kind, wrinkled face. Ah, thank god, a kindred soul enduring the same thing. Nathaniel Colburn Essay Illustration“Missed the bus?” she asked. “Y-yeah,” I mumbled. “You certainly chose the wrong time to do that. Where’re you headed?” Her voice was scratchy, like a smoker’s, but she spoke well. “Home.” “Ah, homes. When I was a bit older than you, my home was a car. Can you believe that my car, an old Toyota, got 50 miles to the gallon? I could drive from here to San Francisco in one sitting.” No, I couldn’t. The more we talked, the more I enjoyed her company and forgot about the craziness around me. She grew up in San Francisco and loved to travel. She loved helping people and went to church. Before I could learn more, a homeless man staggered up to me and asked me for money. I was so uncomfortable I relented. My friend turned to me and advised, “Don’t ever give a homeless person money. Give them food. The stereotype is true — they buy drugs and alcohol. Look around you.” Stunned and feeling naïve, I promised to do so. We talked more until my stomach rumbled and I remarked that I hadn’t eaten since lunch. Just then a bus arrived — apparently hers. She procured two hardboiled eggs from her pocket and offered them to me. I politely declined, and she went to get her stuff. But wait, why was she carrying eggs in her pocket? When the woman emerged from the other side of the stop, she boarded the bus with a sleeping bag and backpack. She was homeless! She smiled down at me, the bus left, and I sat there in quiet shock. I explored the stop anew. Drugs, alcohol, missing limbs were no longer terrifying. Now, I saw the symptoms of sickness, a sad lifestyle that did no harm except to those who lived it. The homeless lady probably has no idea what an effect she had on me. Because of her, I swore to look through the top layers of every situation. Now that I have a car, I never go to the bus stop, but I know its lesson, at least, will continue to take me places. I hope my expanded empathy and open-mindedness will allow me to feel at home in any foreign situation and connect with all people.

I had seen homeless people before, but there was something different about him. He was reading a book, and his eyes lit up as he saw me walking towards him. I slowed down and looked at the book he was reading, and to my surprise, it was a book by Toni Morrison. I struck up a conversation with him, and what I learned in the next few minutes changed my perspective on life. His name was Samuel, and he had been homeless for almost two years. He had lost his job, and then his apartment, and since then, he had been living on the streets. I asked him how he managed to stay positive in such a difficult situation, and he replied, 'Reading is what keeps me going.' He went on to explain how he found books in the trash or received them as donations, and how they had become his only source of solace and escape from the harsh realities of life on the streets. As I listened to him speak, I realized how privileged I was to have a roof over my head and access to education. I had taken these things for granted, but Samuel's words made me appreciate them in a new light. Here was a man who had nothing, but he had found a way to stay positive and keep his spirits up. His love for literature had inspired him to keep going, and it had given him a sense of purpose and meaning. I left Samuel with a newfound sense of gratitude and respect. I had always thought of the homeless as people who had given up on life or were too lazy to work, but Samuel had shattered that stereotype. He was an intelligent, articulate man who had fallen on hard times, but he had not given up hope. He had found a way to keep going, and his love for literature had become his lifeline. Since that day, I have made a conscious effort to give back to my community. I started volunteering at a local homeless shelter, where I help out with meal service and other tasks. I have also started a book drive, where I collect books and distribute them to homeless people in my area. These small acts may not solve the problem of homelessness, but they have given me a sense of purpose and a way to help those in need. Samuel taught me that everyone has a story, and that we should not judge people based on their circumstances. He reminded me that there is always hope, even in the darkest of situations, and that we should never give up on our dreams. He showed me that literature can be a powerful tool for healing and self-discovery, and that it has the ability to transcend barriers and connect people from all walks of life. In conclusion, my encounter with Samuel was a turning point in my life. It made me realize the power of empathy and kindness, and it showed me that we can all make a difference, no matter how small. It taught me that we should never take our blessings for granted, and that we should always be grateful for what we have.

Since that day, I have made a conscious effort to approach every situation with an open mind and empathy. I have learned to look beyond the surface and seek to understand the stories of the people around me. I have come to realize that homelessness is not just a problem of poverty, but a complex issue with many underlying factors, including mental illness, addiction, and lack of affordable housing. I have also learned that small acts of kindness and compassion can make a difference in the lives of those who are struggling. In conclusion, my encounter with Samuel was a transformative experience that taught me the power of empathy, kindness, and the importance of pursuing one's passions despite adversity. It made me realize that we all have a responsibility to help those in need, and that small acts of kindness can make a difference in someone's life. It also taught me that literature has the power to connect people from all walks of life, and that it can be a source of inspiration and hope in difficult times. Samuel's story will always be a part of my own, and I am grateful for the lessons he taught me.",0,2.715252191,2.863361342,3.007076053,3.369763866,2.968227578,17.2,19.4,23.0,26.8,20.0
C2,136,"The streets of San Francisco were bustling with activity as I walked down the sidewalk, the sound of cars honking and people talking filling my ears. The sun was setting, casting a warm orange glow over the city, but as I turned a corner, the atmosphere changed. The once-bustling street became quiet and deserted, and the scent of urine and garbage filled the air. It was then that I saw a man sitting on the sidewalk, his clothes ragged and torn, his face and hands dirty. He was holding a cup, asking passersby for spare change. I had seen homeless people before, but there was something different about him. He was reading a book, and his eyes lit up as he saw me walking towards him. The book was worn and tattered, and its cover had faded, but the words inside were still alive with meaning. As I approached him, I could feel my heart beating faster, unsure of what to expect. But as we began to talk, I realized that he was one of the most resilient people I had ever met. His name was Samuel, and he had been homeless for almost two years after losing his job and apartment. Yet despite his circumstances, he had found a way to keep going. Reading had become his only source of solace and escape from the harsh realities of life on the streets. He found books in the trash or received them as donations, and his love for literature had become his lifeline. The sound of his voice was scratchy, like sandpaper, but his words were clear and articulate. His hands shook as he spoke, and I could see the fatigue in his eyes, but he spoke with passion and conviction. As he spoke, I noticed the veins on his hands and arms, prominent and pulsing, a testament to his resilience and determination. We talked for what seemed like hours, discussing literature, philosophy, and life on the streets. He told me about the challenges he faced every day, from finding food and shelter to avoiding violence and harassment. He shared stories of kindness and generosity from strangers who had helped him along the way, and he spoke of his dreams and aspirations, despite his circumstances. As the night grew darker, I realized that I had lost track of time. The streetlights had come on, casting a yellow glow over the sidewalk, and the sounds of the city had faded into the background. Samuel's eyes were getting heavy, and I could see that he was tired, but he didn't want to end the conversation. Suddenly, he paused and looked up at the sky. 'Do you hear that?' he asked. I listened, and at first, I couldn't hear anything. But then I heard it, the sound of a distant melody, soft and haunting. It was a song that I had heard before, but I couldn't place it. 'It's the sound of hope,' Samuel said, a smile spreading across his face. 'No matter how dark things get, there is always hope.' As I left Samuel that night, I felt a sense of gratitude and respect for him. He had taught me that everyone has a story, and that we should not judge people based on their circumstances. He reminded me that there is always hope, even in the darkest of situations, and that we should never give up on our dreams. His love for literature had inspired him to keep going, and it had given him a sense of purpose and meaning. In the weeks that followed, I thought often of Samuel and his story. I started volunteering at a local homeless shelter, where I learned more about the challenges facing homeless people and the resources available to help them. I also started a book drive, collecting books and distributing them to homeless people in my area. In conclusion, my encounter with Samuel was a transformative experience ",0,2.346290863,2.637989963,2.820368443,3.082943118,2.710630338,12.6,16.0,19.8,21.4,17.0
H,137,"Attempting to juke people like an NFL running back, I slithered my way through the tunnel to the A-Train on 42nd Street during rush hour. I often try to block out the hectic surroundings by isolating myself in music, but I can never seem to get out of the real life time-lapse. In photography, a time-lapse is a technique at which the frame rate is lower than that used to view the sequence, thus, when the sequence is played at normal speed, it gives the effect that time is moving faster, or lapsing. In a Manhattan subway tunnel, a real life time-lapse gives the illusion that thousands are moving around you in one single moment. Luckily, that afternoon, the frame rate was higher than the actual visual sequence. Joe Pucci Essay IllustrationThe crowd shoved their way toward the platform as the screeching train echoed through the underpass. The doors opened and I pushed my way toward the already full train. After five seconds, I began to worry, fearing that the door would close and I would be stuck longer in the blistering, underground cave. The tall, brunette girl in front of me inched her way over the gap between the rusted train and the yellow platform, but one misstep turned my time-lapse upside down. In slow motion, one vertebra at a time, she fell through the gap toward the tracks as the train doors closed. I slipped my hands out of my skinny jeans and reached under her arms as her head neared the platform. I hoisted her up and the sensor doors reopened as we entered the train. I threw my headphones around my shoulders, clumsily turned down my embarrassing music, and asked if she was okay. My pause had lasted for all of about two seconds. No one on the train noticed, not even her mom. This isn’t a heroic tale or a love story, although I felt like it was at the moment. I felt like I had done something much bigger than me, and I also felt like this beautiful girl and I would naturally connect over what just happened. But this wasn’t the case. Instead, I checked on her, smiled, and around 10 seconds after my “lifesaving” moment, immediately isolated myself back into the music. I couldn’t bring out my inner-confidence. I simply stood there thinking of something to say, only to be left mute. It’s easy to say what you want to do, but nearly impossible to bring yourself to do all those things. Life is about taking risks, not about conforming and hiding behind invisible walls. I tend not to struggle with personal adventure; I’ve jumped off 50-foot cliffs and rode the biggest roller coaster dozens of times; however, I do fear being judged and messing up when stepping toward the plate. Life’s too short to live with regret though. My life wasn’t dramatically transposed during this incident, but the things I didn’t do are a constant reminder to stomp on the shortlist of opportunities I’m given. For that girl, she was a vertebra away from not having another chance. When that moment comes for me, I don’t want to have any regrets. I look back at this brief moment with such rue because I feel that my time-lapse was flipped for a reason, yet I couldn’t grasp the opportunity. The music was a place to buy myself more time, a place to quickly think about the next move. But the top-half of the sandglass was empty and the girl got off at the next stop, roughly 30 seconds later. My eyes were fixed on her as she left the train and headed for the stairs. The train began to move when she glanced through the window and mouthed the words, “Thank you.”",1,2.302313421,2.604958301,2.925312997,3.120064566,2.798522296,13.0,16.8,20.2,26.2,19.0
C0,138,"As I stood on the platform of the bustling New York City subway, I couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement mixed with anxiety. It was rush hour, and the platform was crowded with people trying to make their way home after a long day of work. I was a high school senior on a class trip, and we were on our way to a Broadway show. Little did I know, this trip would become one of the most defining moments of my life. As we waited for the train, I noticed a woman standing a few feet away from me. She appeared to be in her mid-fifties, and she was holding a large bag. She seemed tired, and her eyes were closed as if she was trying to rest. Suddenly, she began to sway, and I realized that she was about to fall onto the tracks. Without hesitation, I lunged forward and grabbed her by the arm, pulling her back to safety. At that moment, I felt a rush of adrenaline and a sense of relief wash over me. The woman was disoriented and confused, but she was safe. As I helped her up, I noticed that her bag had spilled onto the platform, and I began to pick up the contents. As I handed her back her belongings, she looked at me with tears in her eyes and said, 'Thank you, young man. You saved my life.' I didn't think much of it at the time, but as I reflect on that moment, I realize that it was more than just a random act of kindness. It was a reminder of the power of human connection and the importance of being present in the moment. In a city where people are constantly rushing and pushing past each other, I was able to make a difference in someone's life simply by being aware of my surroundings and taking action. Growing up, I always felt a sense of responsibility to help others. My parents instilled in me the importance of giving back to the community and being a positive force in the world. As I got older, I became more involved in volunteer work and community service, but it wasn't until that moment on the subway platform that I truly understood the impact that a single act of kindness can have. As I navigate the college application process and think about my future, I am constantly reminded of that moment on the subway platform. It has become a symbol of my values and my desire to make a positive impact in the world. Whether I am studying in a classroom or exploring a new city, I want to be present in the moment and aware of the needs of those around me. At Yale or Harvard, I hope to continue my journey of personal growth and community involvement. I am eager to learn from world-class professors and engage in meaningful conversations with my peers. I am also excited to explore new opportunities for volunteer work and service, and to connect with organizations that share my values. But most importantly, I want to carry the lessons that I learned on that subway platform with me wherever I go. I want to be the kind of person who is aware of the needs of those around me and willing to take action to make a difference. Whether it's saving someone from falling onto the subway tracks or simply being a listening ear for a friend in need, I believe that small acts of kindness can have a ripple effect that can change the world. In conclusion, the experience of saving someone from falling onto the subway tracks has taught me a valuable lesson about the power of human connection and the importance of being present in the moment. As I embark on the next chapter of my life, I am excited to bring this perspective with me and to continue making a positive impact in the world.

C2,140,"The screeching of the train echoed through the underpass, drowning out the chatter of the bustling crowd as we waited on the platform of the New York City subway. It was rush hour, and people were jostling past each other, trying to make their way home after a long day of work. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and perfume, and the bright lights overhead flickered, casting shadows across the platform. I was on a class trip, a high school senior eager to experience the sights and sounds of the city. But as I stood on the platform, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the chaos around me.

She seemed tired and disoriented, and as the train pulled into the station, she stumbled and began to fall toward the tracks. Without thinking, I lunged forward and grabbed her by the arm, pulling her back to safety. In that moment, time seemed to slow down. I felt the rough texture of the woman's coat against my hand, and the cool metal of the train tracks beneath my feet. I heard the sharp intake of breath from the people around me, and the metallic clang of the train doors as they slid shut. It was like being in the eye of the storm, a moment of stillness amidst the chaos. As I helped the woman up, I noticed that her bag had spilled onto the platform. Papers and books were scattered everywhere, like the debris left behind after a tornado. I bent down to pick up the contents, feeling the rough texture of the paper beneath my fingers.

Looking back on that experience, I realize that it was more than just a random act of kindness. It was a symbol of resilience and strength, of how we can weather even the most difficult storms by reaching out and helping one another. My father was one of the most resilient people in my life. He was a Vietnam War veteran who suffered from PTSD, but he never let his struggles define him. Instead, he faced his demons head-on, reaching out for help when he needed it and always putting others before himself. I remember one day when he took me fishing. We were out on the lake, the water calm and still around us. My father was quiet, lost in his thoughts. Suddenly, a gust of wind caught us, and our boat was tossed back and forth like a ship caught in a storm. For a moment, I panicked, feeling like I was being tossed around like a ragdoll. But my father was calm, his hands steady as he navigated us through the choppy waters. It was like he was in the eye of the storm, a beacon of strength and resilience amidst the chaos. That moment has stayed with me, a reminder of how we can weather even the most difficult storms by reaching out and helping one another. It's easy to get lost in the chaos, to feel like we're being tossed around like leaves in the wind. But if we can find that moment of stillness, that moment of connection, we can weather any storm.

H,141,"An eerie silence draped over New Orleans on a humid morning as the insects scampered back into their burrows. It was Saturday morning and I was still lying in bed, playing with the mood ring that my best friend, Anna, had given me as a good luck charm going into fourth grade. It was turquoise, meaning “tranquility.” However, as I focused on the footsteps downstairs, I could tell that both of my parents were in a rush and that Mama was nervous, which was rare. Something was different. I ran down to grab breakfast, but the voice of the news reporter and the hurricane alert noise coming from the kitchen television distracted me. The words on the bottom of the screen read, “mandatory evacuation.” Papa told me to pack some toys for myself and for Rafa, my little brother. I figured we wouldn’t need much since there were so many activities in Houston, where we’d evacuated to before. This time, though, the highways were too congested to get there safely. Instead, we headed to Charity Hospital since Papa, a neuroradiologist, was on call. With our previous experiences of nothing but strong winds and lights-out for a day or two, my parents decided it would be best for the four of us to stay together. Irina RojasWe were assigned to a small room on the 14th floor with two tiny twin beds. That night, the rain pounded on the old windows, like an angry crowd getting more and more agitated. At 1 a.m., a fierce air pressure in the room created a sharp pain in my ears, awakening us, only a mere second before the windows imploded. Shards of glass flew around the room, forcing us to hide in a stuffy hallway storage closet. We huddled around the handheld radio’s static for the next five hours. After the hurricane passed, I could tell Mama was distressed, yet she still managed to smile and say, “Te quiero mucho mi amor, todo va a estar bien.” The next morning, one of the doctors urged us to look out the window. I simply stood there, holding Papa’s sweaty hand, listening to the muddy waters from the Mississippi rushing in. No one expected what would come next. In the basement, the emergency generators flooded, and the smell of rotting corpses from the morgue grew, getting stronger with the heat. In the lobby, people broke into the vending machines, stealing and selling the food. We didn’t have any clean water either, so showers soon became Purell sanitation wipes, and toilets became buckets to throw out the window. During the day, my parents were busy, so Rafa and I painted “SOS” on bed sheets and hung them outside. At night, we played cards, and I silently sat next to a nurse who thought about the dog she had left at home. No one knew if our homes or friends were okay, nor when we’d be rescued, but I didn’t cry. I was in survival mode. A week later, we were rescued on swamp boats. That year, I attended four different schools. When it was over, I wept uncontrollably. Hurricane Katrina has challenged me. It has humbled and motivated me.

C0,142,"As I stood on the roof of my family's house, the only thing left of our once lively neighborhood was a vast, murky sea of water. Hurricane Katrina had ripped through New Orleans, leaving behind a trail of devastation that was both heartbreaking and awe-inspiring. In that moment, I realized that this disaster would change my life in ways that I could not even imagine. Growing up in New Orleans, I was used to the threat of hurricanes. Every year, my family and I would prepare for the worst by stocking up on supplies and boarding up our windows. However, nothing could have prepared us for the ferocity of Hurricane Katrina. As the storm approached, my family and I decided to ride it out in our home, hoping that we would be safe. But the hurricane had other plans. The wind howled and the rain pounded against our windows, but it was the flooding that was the most terrifying. The water rose quickly, and soon it was up to our waists. We tried to stem the tide by filling sandbags and using them to block our doors, but it was no use. The water continued to rise, and soon it was up to our necks. We knew that we had to get out. We swam through the murky waters, trying to find higher ground. We saw houses that had been ripped apart by the storm, cars that had been overturned, and even dead bodies floating in the water. It was like something out of a nightmare. Eventually, we made it to our roof, where we waited for rescue. For days, we huddled together, hungry, thirsty, and scared. We watched as helicopters flew overhead, but none of them seemed to notice us. It was only when a group of volunteers in a small boat spotted us that we were finally rescued. As we made our way to a shelter, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the kindness of strangers. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, my family and I were forced to start over. We lost everything – our home, our possessions, and our sense of security. But we also gained something – a new appreciation for the power of community. In the weeks and months that followed, I saw firsthand the incredible resilience of the people of New Orleans. Despite the devastation, people banded together to help one another. Neighbors shared what little they had, strangers worked side by side to clear debris, and volunteers from all over the world poured into the city to help in any way they could. I was inspired by the kindness and generosity of the people around me, and I knew that I wanted to give back. I started volunteering at a local community center, where I helped to rebuild homes, provide food and water to those in need, and offer emotional support to people who had lost everything.

The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina was even more devastating than the storm itself. The streets were littered with debris, and the smell of rotting garbage and sewage filled the air. People were struggling to find clean water and food, and many were homeless. But even in the face of this disaster, I saw acts of incredible resilience and compassion. I remember one man in particular, who had lost everything in the storm, but still managed to offer comfort to those around him. He shared what little he had and made sure that everyone had a place to sleep. He was a symbol of hope in the midst of such despair. Another example of resilience came from a family who had lost their home in the storm. Despite the devastation, they managed to salvage some of their possessions and turned them into makeshift shelters for other families who were homeless. They showed that even in the darkest of times, there is always a way to help others and find hope. As I reflect on my experience with Hurricane Katrina, I am struck by the power of community in the face of adversity. It was only through the kindness of strangers and the support of my family that I was able to survive. I also learned the importance of resilience, compassion, and determination.

The aftermath of the hurricane was a symbol of the incredible strength and resilience of the human spirit, and I am grateful to have experienced it firsthand.",0,2.440374655,2.638228732,2.852543916,3.042361029,2.741700433,13.0,16.0,19.0,21.0,17.0
H,145,"It’s six o’clock. From down the hall, I hear my mother’s footsteps approaching. The door opens. “Time to get up!” I make the journey from my warm bed to the hard oak of the kitchen table downstairs. Racing thoughts about the day's events, upcoming tests, hours of inevitable homework are silenced as the Miles Davis sextet walks out onto the stage in my mind. There’s a round of applause and the group starts playing. The men look at Paul Chambers on bass as he thumbs the familiar riff of “So What.” My focus is not on him, however; my eyes digress to the sparkling silver Gretsch drums in the middle of the stage. This is what I've been waiting for. Philly Joe Jones sits behind the carefully crafted set and, in a couple of measures, digs into his ride cymbal while keeping time with his left foot on the hi-hat pedal, his face shining with sweat, his smile beaming excitement, every pore of his body oozing jazz. I finish my eggs and venture back upstairs to clean up, put on some clothes, and organize my backpack before leaving for school. I hold the toothbrush to my mouth with my right hand and play out the ghost notes of Jones’ snare drum with my left hand on my thigh. I go down the stairs for the last time, taking each step in rhythm, the thud of each foot a kick on the bass drum. A school day ensues. The bell rings, time for seventh period BC Calc and another derivative quiz. I methodically go through the formulae in my head. Should I use the quotient rule, or change the exponent of the second function and use the multiplication rule with the chain rule? I feel like Philly Joe given a straight-ahead 4/4 bop groove; he could keep it at 4 or he could spice it up with two groups of 3 and one group of 2 with quick Swiss Army triplet fills. My hands express the mathematical directives in my head, they feed one off the other, just as Elvin Jones grooves off the blazing solos of Trane. While trading fours, Coltrane blares out sixteenth-note triplets and Jones responds with thirty-second notes between the snare, the toms, and his vintage Zildjian Ks. My quiz asks me for the derivative of a complicated polynomial — my pencil draws variables, exponents, coefficients and parentheses, much the way Elvin responds to the tenor sax with comping paradiddles, accents, ruffs and cymbal hits. The solo is finished; I hand in the paper. It’s now five o’clock. I sit at my desk, contemplating my approach to an English assignment. My confusion mirrors the playing of a complex time signature, say 19/8. Counting 19 beats every measure while keeping perfect time is close to impossible. I ponder solutions. Would I divide it into two groups of 7 and a group of 5 or count it in four groups of 4 and then a quick group of 3? I complete the assigned essay by seven. The clock strikes ten. I lie in my bed, my head reaping the benefits of the cold side of the pillow. Before I drift off, I hear the soft sighs of Jack DeJohnette’s brushes on the skins, complementing a mellow Michael Brecker ballad. Lights fade into darkness as one day’s end blends into another’s beginning. I live my life through music. The complex rhythms of jazz drumming inspire me to be spontaneous and creative, to play off the sundry challenges I face every day. Time perpetually moves forward; I will always be there to keep it.",1,2.190417868,2.614137182,3.078954837,3.683751998,2.709323798,6.8,12.0,21.4,26.2,13.0
C0,146,"Music has been a constant presence in my life, a thread that has followed me through the ups and downs of growing up. Whether it was the lullabies my mother sang to me as a child or the first song I learned to play on my own guitar, music has been a compass that guided me through life's challenges. It's been a companion through both the good and bad times, providing solace and comfort when I needed it most. I believe that living through music has taught me the most valuable lesson of all: that challenges are not meant to be faced alone. When I was just ten years old, my parents got a divorce. Suddenly, everything I knew was turned upside down. The music around me started to sound different, sharper and colder than before. I didn't know how to process the complex emotions I was feeling; I was sad, angry, and confused all at once. It was around this time that my grandmother gave me my first guitar, telling me that music would help me find peace. As I began to learn chords and strum patterns, I found myself lost in the melodies I was creating. I could pour all of my emotions into the songs I was playing, letting the warmth of the strings comfort me in a way that my family and friends couldn't. Learning to play the guitar was difficult, but I found myself drawn to the challenge. I spent hours practicing, pushing myself to get better and better until I could play a full song from start to finish. It wasn't just the music that was providing me with solace, but the act of learning and improving as well. As I got older, music continued to be a constant in my life. It was with me as I navigated the tricky social dynamics of middle school, and helped me build the confidence to audition for my high school's prestigious music program. It wasn't long before I found myself in a band with some of my closest friends, playing gigs at local bars and coffee shops. Music had become a bridge between us, a way to connect in a way that felt deeper than just hanging out and shooting the breeze. But despite the joy that music brought me, I was still facing challenges that felt insurmountable at times. When I was a freshman in high school, I was diagnosed with ADHD. Suddenly, everything felt more complicated. Homework was harder to complete, focusing in class was a struggle, and my once sharp memory had started to slip. I felt like I was falling behind, like I wasn't living up to my own potential. It was during this time that I discovered the power of collaboration. As a musician, you are only as good as the people you surround yourself with. No matter how proficient you are on your own, there's always something new to learn or a different perspective that can be gained from working with others. When I started collaborating with my bandmates, I found that we could create something bigger and better than any of us could on our own. We bounced ideas off of each other, challenging one another to dig deeper and think more critically about the music we were making. It was a reminder that challenges are not meant to be faced alone. In many ways, my journey through music has taught me more about life than any textbook or lecture ever could. I have learned that challenges are an integral part of life, and that they can be daunting and overwhelming when faced alone. But when you challenge yourself to learn, collaborate and work with others, you can achieve more than you ever imagined. Whether you're strumming a guitar or working on a group project for school, the lessons learned through music are universal. In the end, I believe that music has taught me that the beauty of life is not in the perfection of it all, but in the challenge of it. It's about confronting the things that scare you, about persevering through the toughest of times, and about learning from your mistakes. Living through music has given me the strength to face my challenges head on, and the courage to collaborate with others to achieve greatness. Whether I end up studying music or not, the lessons I have learned through playing, performing and collaborating will continue to shape me far into the future.",0,2.567725475,2.774755344,2.888781796,3.026692404,2.784684289,13.4,20.0,22.0,24.8,20.0
C1,147,"From a young age, I have always had a curiosity for the world around me. Whether it was exploring the natural world through hiking and camping trips or diving deeper into the intricacies of human behavior through literature and movies, I was always looking for ways to expand my horizons. But as I got older, I began to realize that my curiosity alone was not enough; I needed to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to truly make a difference. I believe that this realization is what has driven me to become the person I am today. One of the strongest drivers of my curiosity has been my passion for science. As a child, I was fascinated by the natural world, always asking questions about how things worked and why they were the way they were. As I got older, I discovered that these questions could be answered through the scientific method, a framework that allowed me to explore the intricacies of the world in a structured and systematic way. There was always something new to learn, whether it was through researching a topic for a school project or conducting my own experiments in my backyard. One of the most formative experiences of my scientific education came during my sophomore year of high school. I enrolled in an advanced biology class with a teacher who was passionate about the subject, and who pushed us to think outside the box and look at the world through a critical lens. It was in this class that I learned the value of experimentation and the importance of collaboration. We were encouraged to form our own hypotheses and design experiments to test them, working together to brainstorm new ideas and troubleshoot challenges. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that cemented my love for science. But it wasn't just my passion for science that drove me to pursue my goals. I also found myself drawn towards leadership and advocacy, using my skills and knowledge to make a difference in the world. As a member of my school's debate team, I learned how to analyze complex issues and present arguments in a clear and convincing way. I also became involved in volunteering in my community, working with organizations that focused on issues such as environmental conservation and social justice. Through these experiences, I discovered that my passion for science was only one part of a larger goal: to make the world a better place. As I look towards the future, I see endless opportunities to continue on this path of exploration and advocacy. I am excited to pursue a degree in biology or chemistry, delving deeper into the mysteries of the natural world and developing new ways to solve society's most pressing challenges. I am also eager to become involved in research, collaborating with other scientists to develop new technologies and find solutions to issues such as climate change and disease. Finally, I am passionate about advocating for change, using my knowledge and skills to make a difference in the world. In the end, I believe that my passion for science, my drive to become a leader and advocate, and my curiosity about the world around me have all come together to form the person that I am today. I am excited to continue on this journey, using my skills and knowledge to make a difference in the world and leave a lasting impact on the lives of those around me.",0,2.853925274,3.060956222,3.252194462,3.565965196,3.132783976,17.0,21.4,25.0,30.8,23.5
C2,148,"As I walk through the hallways of my high school, I can't help but take notice of the little details that lie within. The sound of lockers opening and closing echoes throughout the halls, as the smell of freshly baked muffins wafts through the air. The texture of the freshly waxed floors creates a smooth surface under my feet, while the bright lights overhead illuminate each passing student. These sensory details are emblematic of the world around us, and I find myself constantly drawn to them as I try to understand the intricate details that make up our world. In many ways, these details are like the building blocks of our world. Just as each component of a building must fit together perfectly to create a stable structure, so too must the details of our lives be carefully pieced together to form a cohesive whole. This is what drives my fascination with science, biology and chemistry in particular. Each organism, each cell, each atom is carefully constructed with intricate details, each working together in perfect harmony to create the complex web of life that surrounds us. However, science is not the only facet of my life that has driven me towards curiosity and exploration. As a member of my school's debate team, I have learned the importance of clear communication and the power of persuasive arguments. I have also discovered that true leadership is not just about standing out but about working collaboratively with others to achieve a common goal. This spirit of collaboration has been a cornerstone of my involvement in volunteering, an activity in which I have discovered a passion for advocacy and social justice. In observing the world around me, I have also come to appreciate the value of symbolism. Although the world may seem random and chaotic at times, there is often a deeper meaning beneath the surface. Just as a metaphor can bring a story to life, so too can symbolism help to reveal the underlying truths of the world around us. For instance, the endangered polar bear has become a symbol of the dire effects of climate change, reminding us of the need to act boldly and urgently to protect our planet. In the end, my journey has been one of exploration and discovery. I have learned the value of curiosity, of asking questions and seeking answers. I have discovered the power of collaboration, of working with others to tackle complex challenges. And I have come to appreciate the importance of advocacy, of using our skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world around us. It is these values that I hope to bring to my future studies and my career, as I seek to make a difference in the world and leave a lasting impact on the lives of those around me. As I gaze up at the bright lights overhead, I am reminded of the limitless possibilities that lie ahead.

H,149,"Eleanor, or “Auntie El” as she was called by everyone, was my primary caretaker for the first fifteen years of my life. Auntie El grew up in the blue-collar town of Everett, Mass., never married and lived with my grandmother, who was her older sister. She spent her spare time bowling and looking for bargains on items nobody needed. Auntie El worked for the Gillette Company for 43 years in its South Boston factory as an inspection clerk in the Quality Control Group, scrutinizing the edges of razor blades under a microscope. Auntie El retired in November of 1989, the exact same month and year in which I was born. My parents both had demanding jobs with long hours and therefore needed someone to look after me during the day. Three months after I was born, they still had not found a babysitter, and time was running out. My grandmother volunteered her younger sister, mainly to get her out of the house they were sharing. Auntie El was called in to “pinch hit” on a temporary basis. Cranky and wheezy from her latest cigarette, Auntie El walked into our house on her first day wearing her flowered apron and carrying a plastic grocery bag in which she packed her clothes for the week — not exactly Mary Poppins. Both my parents did not see this arrangement working, but were grateful for her services until a suitable caretaker could be found. She took care of me for two weeks until she went on a previously scheduled trip to Las Vegas. I guess she must have softened to the idea of caring for me because, halfway through the trip, she called my mother and told her she wanted the job full time. Auntie El started the next Monday. No longer able to smoke because of my fragile lungs (I was on a respirator for several days after I was born), Auntie El had to find activities to take her mind off cigarettes. She took me on long walks every day and, as I grew older, would play catch with me in the backyard. Her health improved dramatically. We were good for each other. As the years passed, we became even closer. By the time I was in first grade, she was a faculty favorite at my school and could be found waiting for me every day in the parking lot in her white Cutlass Ciera Oldsmobile with her BINGO plate on the front. She quickly became a school legend when she was the only adult in memory to join the Halloween parade which took us through every classroom in the school in costume. Auntie El wore a witch’s hat and a black and orange polka dot apron; I was a fireman. Through our years together, we had numerous adventures. One night, her nose bled profusely and she could not stop the bleeding. Since my parents were at work, she had to call an ambulance and was forced to take me with her. With the sirens blaring, I hopped in the back, dressed in my red Power Ranger pajamas. Auntie El’s tough, gritty mentality made me a stronger person. She grew up without a father and her family was poor. She and her siblings were taken out of school by tenth grade in order to help support the family. She never missed a chance to point out how hard my parents worked to provide me with great opportunities and called the town in which we lived “la de da land.” I always had Auntie El to give me a dose of reality. The littlest things seemed to pull Auntie El and me together. Our passion for food was a regular topic, and we would have daily discussions on what I had to eat for lunch that day at school. Late at night, I would sneak up to her room and watch episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond and would laugh until my parents heard us and ended the fun. No matter where we were, you could always find Auntie El and me laughing about something and enjoying the moment. In the fall of my freshman year, Auntie El was diagnosed with colon cancer. After a successful operation, she spent some time in a rehabilitation center to regain her strength. On Thanksgiving evening, 2004, Auntie El suffered a heart attack. She fell to the floor, and hit her head. She was found later the next morning, and was pronounced dead. I found out when I heard my mother scream on the phone with the hospital. Auntie El’s passing affected our whole family, but it was particularly tough for me. My good friend, my partner in crime and my teacher was no longer with me. Coming home to her every day for fifteen years was something I really enjoyed. Arriving home to an empty, quiet house and having days pass without talking to her was the worst experience of my life. I did not know life without Auntie El. However, my family and I had to adjust but I did not know how to start over. I found myself thinking about Auntie El a lot and, one day, realized that she was still with me when I would hear her voice in the back of my mind during a test or a game or just when I was making dinner for myself. More importantly, I realized that Auntie El instilled in me the values that I admired in her. She was genuine, caring and respectful. She taught me to work hard, and be mentally tough for life’s challenges. Her perseverance and grit showed me a lot and provided me with the perfect role model for life.",1,2.52887535,2.849769925,3.025509987,3.330397324,2.932384144,11.0,15.0,18.0,23.0,17.0
C0,150,"When it comes to role models and caretakers, it is easy to think of someone who has been a constant presence in your life. For many people, this person may be a parent or a grandparent who has selflessly devoted themselves to looking after you throughout your childhood. However, my personal experience has been quite different. It was not until I was in the seventh grade when I first met my role model and caretaker, Mrs. Thomas. Mrs. Thomas wasn't a family member, but a teacher at my school. Despite teaching social studies to thirty other seventh graders, Mrs. Thomas still found the time to become someone I could depend on outside of the classroom. It all started with a simple question I had for her after class one day. I was struggling with the new material we were learning in class and was finding it difficult to stay interested. However, Mrs. Thomas took the time to sit down with me and go over the material again, explaining it in a way that I could understand. From that moment on, I regularly visited her classroom for extra help and we developed a close relationship beyond the boundaries of the classroom. As time went on, Mrs. Thomas became much more than just an academic coach for me. She became a trusted friend and mentor throughout all of middle and high school. We would discuss everything from schoolwork to our personal lives. Mrs. Thomas wasn't just a role model and caretaker to me, she was my confidant. Mrs. Thomas had the gift of recognizing potential in her students, and she saw something special in me. During my sophomore year of high school, she encouraged me to join the debate team. I was hesitant at first, but Mrs. Thomas had a quiet confidence in me that I had never experienced before. Her faith in me gave me the courage to follow through with it. Over time, I developed a passion for debate and public speaking, and I wouldn't be where I am today without her encouragement and support. Mrs. Thomas didn't just inspire me to become a better student or speaker; she inspired me to become a better person. She showed me what true kindness and commitment look like, and she taught me the importance of reaching out to others. Throughout my experience, it was never about the accolades or recognition. Mrs. Thomas never expected anything in return for her time and efforts. She genuinely wanted to help every student she encountered - which is why, even seven years later, I still think of her as my role model and caretaker. When Mrs. Thomas passed away last year, my grief was immense. However, as I started to remember her lessons and think about her legacy, I found that the impact she had on my life was something that couldn't be taken away. At her memorial service, I was moved by the outpouring of love and gratitude from so many former students who had experienced the same maternal kindness that I had. With her passing, I felt an obligation to make sure her memory lived on. So, I started volunteering as a peer tutor at my school. I wanted to honor her memory by becoming a positive presence in the lives of younger students. I know how much her support and guidance meant to me, and I hoped that I could provide something similar for others. In doing so, Mrs. Thomas reminded me of the power of a single individual's influence. Even though she never made headlines or was the subject of any major accomplishments, her contributions to society are immeasurable. It was through her quiet service that she made a lasting impact on so many of us students. As I look forward to my college years, I plan to carry on Mrs. Thomas's spirit of compassion and service. I hope to become involved in community service and volunteer work, and to follow in her footsteps by uplifting those around me. In conclusion, Mrs. Thomas was an incredible role model and caretaker who impacted my life in ways that I will never forget. She showed me the value of kindness, hard work, and selflessness, and she inspired me to become a better person. Even though she is no longer with us, her legacy will live on in the lasting impact she had on countless students like me. I hope her spirit can inspire others, just as it has inspired me, to follow in her footsteps and make a positive difference in the world.",0,2.684513466,2.931011218,3.047385591,3.275138282,2.985919887,13.8,17.6,21.0,24.0,20.0

Like Auntie El, I believe that life is best lived when we are true to ourselves, present for others, and make the most of every moment. Growing up, my Auntie El played a crucial role in my life. She was my primary caretaker, my confidant, and my friend. She instilled in me the values of hard work, perseverance, and grit. She always reminded me to be mentally tough for life's challenges, and that the little things in life are the most important. Auntie El's genuine, caring, and respectful nature set the standard for how I relate to others, and her impact on my life was immense. One significant lesson Auntie El taught me was the power of generosity. Auntie El never hesitated to go above and beyond to help those she cared about. She believed in taking care of others and was always willing to lend a helping hand. This selflessness still inspires me to be involved in my community, to give back to others and to take care of those around me. Another valuable lesson Auntie El taught me was to be resilient in the face of adversity. Auntie El's experiences taught her how to be tough, even when the chips were down. Her relentless spirit and perseverance are something I have always admired. Life is not always fair, but Auntie El taught me that we are strong enough to face any challenge that comes our way. She showed me that the measure of a person's strength is not in what they can do when things go right, but how they react when things go wrong. Auntie El's impact on my life was most evident during a particularly difficult time. I suffered from chronic anxiety and depression during college, which made it hard for me to form relationships and get involved in activities. Auntie El offered unwavering support, encouraging me, and reminding me of the lessons she taught me growing up. Her guidance gave me the strength to seek help as I navigated my struggles. Auntie El reminds me that with the right support and guidance, anyone can overcome the challenges life throws at us, and that asking for help when we need it is a sign of strength, not weakness.

C2,152,"My Auntie El had a unique way of teaching me life lessons that resonated with me. With a twinkle in her eye and a smile on her face, she would remind me that every day was a gift, and that we should make the most of every moment. One of the most vivid memories I have of Auntie El was watching her work in the garden. She would kneel down in the dirt, her fingers delicately turning the soil, and her eyes focused on the task at hand. The smell of fresh earth mixed with the sweet fragrance of blooming flowers always filled the air. Auntie El's love for gardening was her way of reminding me that every day was a chance to grow, just like the flowers in her garden. Another lesson Auntie El ingrained in me was the importance of being present for others. In our family gatherings, Auntie El was always the life of the party. She had a contagious energy that made everyone feel welcome, and her laughter filled the room. She demonstrated the importance of being there for those we love, and instilled in me the value of creating memories with the people we care about. But Auntie El's impact on my life extended beyond her bubbly personality. She taught me the importance of grit and perseverance. One day, after I had failed to make the school's soccer team, I was feeling dejected and ready to give up. Auntie El sat me down and told me a story about one of her toughest challenges. She had been laid off from her job and had to find a new career in her fifties. Despite the difficulty of the situation, she persevered and found a job in a new field. I realized then that failure is not the end, but a new beginning. Her story gave me the motivation to keep trying and working hard to achieve my goals. Auntie El continued to teach me about the power of resilience during my college years when I struggled with chronic anxiety and depression. She was a constant source of support and encouragement during those dark days, and reminded me that I had the strength to overcome my struggles. Her unwavering spirit and unstoppable nature gave me the courage to seek help and to keep fighting. Perhaps the most valuable lesson my Auntie El taught me was the power of generosity. She always found the time and energy to lend a helping hand to those around her.

H,153,"Maybe it’s because I live in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, where Brett Favre draws more of a crowd on Sunday than any religious service, cheese is a staple food, it’s sub-zero during global warming, current “fashions” come three years after they’ve hit it big with the rest of the world, and where all children by the age of ten can use a 12-gauge like it’s their job. I shouldn’t have told them I live on a farm with a barn, ten chickens, a dog, a canary, two thousand deer, coyotes and beautiful Silver Bass Lake. When I say beautiful lake, I mean it in the past tense. Each year the water level drops several inches, and we now refer to it more accurately as “the puddle” threatening to transform into a wetland. But even though you can't swim because of the weeds that entangle your appendages, you can still kayak! Just be sure you wear muck boots with your swimsuit because we traditionally portage the kayak a quarter mile down the bank to find water deep enough to push in. The bloodsuckers are also a turnoff. In the last year I have only had two bloodsuckers (leeches with small teeth) attach to me. The anticoagulant kept my leg bleeding for around two hours while I lay with my leg elevated; my neurotic mother pacing the room and crying while on hold with the local ER. But really, that's no reason to postpone a visit! Another fabulous addition to our “farmstead” is the field that Papa was able to mow into a running trail. In order to escape the locusts that cling to your legs and spit brown juice on anything they come in contact with, you have to run early in the morning, and by early I mean quarter to five and still dark. However, this does pose another problem. Recently we’ve spotted some bear scat, indicating there is a bear somewhere on our property. This was confirmed when my sister ran into two cubs and a mother sow during her morning run. Rule number one for human survival; do not run into a mother bear with her two cubs. Luckily my sister is an elite cross country runner and was out of the woods by the time the bears even realized an intruder’s presence. But I still find it an excellent excuse to not use the “awesome” running trail. Being a true-blooded Wisconsinite, naturally winter is my favorite time of year. The amphitheatre in our field provides ideal opportunity for break-neck tobogganing, and the running path is converted annually into a cross country ski trail. Two years ago we recorded five feet of snow in our field. It’s great for my brother and sister who just prance around happily on the icy surface, however, I tend to sink down to somewhere around my mid-thighs. If you’ve ever watched the movie A Christmas Story with Ralphie’s little brother in the intense snowsuit that resembles the Michelin Man, you would understand what I look like. Adding to my attire of boots, mittens, hat, scarf, face mask, long johns with snow pants and two sweaters, my mother insists I wear an oversized blaze orange jacket, because in Rhinelander, every season is deer season. It probably wasn’t the best idea to mention my two uncles. Uncle Pete is fun; he always comes to watch the Packers game on Sunday and enjoy my mother’s home-cooked brunch. But the partial he received last year, after he knocked out his two front teeth dog sledding with his huskies through downtown Rhinelander, does at times make you lose your appetite. My Uncle John sometimes can be mistaken for a mountain man. His assortment of furs and strange bags full of fishing gear and other odd tools whose uses are a mystery to everyone but Johnny himself, add to his “Yooper” appearance. To clarify for those non-Midwesterners, a Yooper is a term used to describe those from the backwoods of the Upper Peninsula. So sometimes he’s a little strange. However, he is probably one of the most well-known men in all of northern Wisconsin; famous for providing fresh bluegills to the Franciscan nuns, his state-renowned loon calls, and his never-ending repertoire of jokes. He’s burst into our house on several occasions with a dripping and still-twitching forty-eight-inch musky. And did I mention he’s a part-time grave digger? But no matter how hick it may seem, in the end, I just feel sorry for everyone who scoffed at a visit to Rhinelander. Long nature walks in the woods, fresh little red potatoes from the garden, glowing sunsets off the porch, families of loons and whippoorwill calls, rhubarb and asparagus patches, freshly fallen snow, fiery reds, tangerine oranges and the sunburst golds of autumn, making apple pie with the apples from our orchard, playing piano at night in front of a blazing fire — they’re the ones missing out.",1,2.46008547,2.841773679,3.301213304,3.758691077,3.048033085,12.0,17.0,24.0,30.0,19.5
C0,154,"Growing up in rural Wisconsin has had an undeniable impact on my life. The peaceful countryside, with fields of wheat and corn as far as the eye can see, starkly contrasts with the hustle and bustle of city life. But my experience living in a place where the skyline is dominated by silos and barns, rather than towering skyscrapers, has been more than idyllic. It has shaped me into the person I am today. When I first heard that I was going to live in the middle of nowhere, I was less than thrilled. The lack of a thriving nightlife or a diverse social scene was daunting, to say the least. But as I started to explore the countryside, I found beauty in the simplicity of life. I learned to appreciate the enchanting sunsets, the thousands of stars that light up the night sky, and the animals that roam free in the pastures. Living in rural Wisconsin has taught me to find joy in the small things in life. Growing up in a place where neighbors are miles apart might deter some, but not me. My family taught me the importance of community, even in the most remote settings. Though our closest neighbors were half an hour away, we did not let distance define our connections. We banded together and helped each other through tough times, whether that was through bringing a home-cooked meal or helping build a barn. In a world where technology allows us to be constantly connected, living in rural Wisconsin has taught me the importance of human connection and the value of true relationships. The constraints of rural life can be challenging at times. The small town where I grew up had a population of only a few hundred people, which meant that everyone knew each other’s business. While this could be frustrating, it also meant that everyone looked out for one another. This sense of belonging fueled my desire to give back to my community. During my senior year of high school, I organized a fundraising event to support the local volunteer fire department. Through a series of events and by leveraging the power of social media, we were able to raise over $5,000 in one afternoon. The fire department was overwhelmed with gratitude, and the experience made me realize the true potential of community service. Living in rural Wisconsin has taught me that sometimes, the most significant changes come from the smallest acts of kindness. My parents always emphasized the importance of hard work, and rural life provided ample opportunities to put those lessons to practice. My summers were spent working on my grandparents' dairy farm, where my family taught me the value of manual labor. There are no shortcuts in farming, and I learned that if I wanted to achieve something, I had to work hard for it. The long hours of tending to cows and baling hay have instilled in me a strong work ethic that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Living in rural Wisconsin has taught me the which of these it has taught me must be specified importance of perseverance and dedication. In many ways, living in rural Wisconsin has given me an appreciation for simplicity. There are no fancy cafes or pop-up shops, but this just means that I have had to find joy in other things, such as reading or star-gazing. This has also translated into a more sustainable lifestyle. Living in the countryside has taught me the importance of environmental preservation and being mindful of the impact we have on the earth. Despite the challenges of living in a rural area, I can say with confidence that I am grateful to have grown up in such an environment. It has taught me the value of hard work and human connection, and it has given me a deep appreciation for the beauty of nature. As I look towards the future, I am excited to bring the lessons I learned from rural Wisconsin with me wherever I go.",0,2.622520665,2.937028383,3.074497793,3.284781815,2.956179173,14.6,19.0,23.0,25.0,20.0
C1,155,"Growing up in a tranquil rural setting has provided me with an experience like no other. The heart of the countryside, with its rolling green pastures that stretch for miles, couldn't be more different from the fast-paced lifestyle of a city dweller. However, I'm truly grateful for this upbringing, as it has shaped the person I am today. Initially, I wasn't thrilled when my family first decided to move to the countryside. There were no exclusive lounges, gourmet restaurants or a pulsating nightlife to look forward to. Nevertheless, I came to discover the peace that comes with a slower lifestyle, where the silence is occasionally broken by birds singing and leaves rustling in the wind. This upbringing taught me to find pleasure in the simple things in life, a valuable lesson that I continue to hold dear. Despite the spacious acres separating us from neighbors, I came to realize the importance of developing relationships and the impact it could have on a community. The people around us were the only people we had to lean on in hard times. So, it was no wonder that everyone was willing to lend a helping hand when the need arose. In a world captivated by technology, rural life taught me the importance of developing true connections and how it could help foster growth. The rural lifestyle often shadows the needs of individuals who live in populous cities. Although information travels at the speed of light, most remote regions remain forgotten. This sometimes posed challenges growing up; for example, living in a small town of barely a few hundred residents meant that the community was quite tight-knit. It also meant that everyone knew everything about everyone, and it wasn't so easy to keep secrets. But, despite the constraints, I gained a sense of belonging and developed a strong desire to give back to the community. I realized the power of small acts of kindness when I organized a fundraiser to support the local fire department, and thanks to the generosity of the community, we raised $5000 in just an afternoon. The generosity displayed took me by surprise, and the experience spurred me to have a greater appreciation for human beings' capabilities when we work collectively. My parents instilled in me the values of determination and hard work from a young age, and rural life presented the perfect environment to put those lessons into practice. We worked on my grandparents' dairy farm during summer, and it wasn't always a walk in the park. However, the experience taught me the value of manual labor, and I learned that working hard doesn't mean having to cut corners. Tending to cows or baling hay on long hot summer days taught me the worth of perseverance and the satisfaction that comes with earning the fruits of my labor. Rural life may seem somewhat monotonous compared to the lives that city dwellers live, but living in the countryside taught me the importance of simplicity. There is no need for everyday grand adventures, cafes, or a pop-up shop when there is so much natural beauty to admire. Reading a book or stargazing at night, taking a walk in the park, or picking fresh fruits from the garden are simple pleasures that provide immeasurable satisfaction. This lifestyle's practicality also made me mindful of living sustainably, which encouraged me to seek ways to help manage the environment with which I interact. Although living in the countryside had its challenges, it shaped me into an individual who has an unwavering appreciation for work ethic, strong community involvement, and living life sustainably through simplicity. It allowed me the freedom to learn and gave me an opportunity to appreciate the beauty in nature while still being committed to helping others. This way of life is one that I continue to carry within me, and it will have a vital role in the goals that I intend to achieve in the future.",0,2.699532893,2.922661431,3.246237941,3.426520217,3.033712482,16.0,22.0,25.0,27.4,23.0
C2,156,"The sun was setting over the cotton candy-colored sky, and I could hear the rustling sound of leaves, as I stood in awe of the vast green pastures that stretch for miles around me. It was a serene sight that used to make me feel that I lived in a world different from everyone else - a world that I never knew existed before I moved to the countryside. The solitude offered by rural life was a novelty to me initially. In the village, there were no loud honks of cars, and I rarely heard police sirens. The only sounds that would pierce through the eerie silence were the songs of birds and an occasional moo from a cow. These sensory details that surround me made me feel alive, and I'm grateful for the upbringing that taught me to revel in the little moments that life offers. Life in a tight-knit community came with its sets of challenges, and it tested me in ways that the city could never do. With little to no anonymity, it was tough to keep secrets. But because of this environment, I developed a strong sense of belonging and an unwavering desire to give back to my community. In rural areas, everyone knows everyone, and kindness is a natural thing. It wasn't until our local fire department needed help that I discovered the true nature of my community. The bond that developed between us when everyone came together to help was a sentiment that I would never forget. Growing up on a dairy farm, with rolling green fields stretching for as far as the eyes could see, was an experience like no other. The manual labor was indescribable - from feeding the cows, baling hay to cleaning up their manure - it wasn't a job for the faint-hearted. The early mornings were for milking the cows and the late evenings for delivering milk to our clients. With each new day came a fresh set of to-do list, but it taught me the value of work ethic and the tremendous satisfaction that comes with earning the fruits of my labor. Rural life took me away from the glitz and glamour of the city, but it didn't make me feel like I was missing out on anything. Even now, I appreciate the simplicity that comes with the rural life that is often overlooked by people living in urban areas. Watching the stars glimmer in the night sky or reading a book under a shady tree is enough to satisfy my soul. These sensory details have a special place in my heart, and I learned how to enjoy life with the little things they offer. As I reminisce about the rural lifestyle that made me the person that I am today, I realized that it made me aware of living sustainably. Before recycling became a mandatory aspect of our lives, rural areas fought to preserve the environment they lived in. I witnessed the way people recycled, composted, and saved water. This knowledge gave me a renewed appreciation for the environment and set me on a path to learn how to live sustainably. Every little moment has contributed to who I am today, and the rural lifestyle that I experienced will have an everlasting impression on me. The hard work, sense of community, and appreciation for the environment are values that I hold dear. These lessons have not only strengthened the individual I am today but will continue to form the person that I aim to be tomorrow.",0,2.782360387,2.941543837,3.049935912,3.177469217,2.980844424,17.2,22.0,23.0,25.8,22.0
H,157,"“Do not judge this piece until you have performed it.” Repeatedly, Mr. Benstein challenged us to look beyond the rugged atonalism which went against every concept of our musical knowledge, and convey the raw emotion that inspired Karel Husa to compose Music for Prague 1968. At that time I did not understand how emotions could be expressed without words nor could I comprehend the nightmarish atmosphere of a Soviet invasion. Instead I was more overwhelmed by the foreign rhythms, the harsh, squeaking notes that existed in the highest registers of my clarinet, the thunderous tempo. I hated the song. Just as Music for Prague shattered my perspective of music, my mother’s unsuccessful battle against leukemia shattered the stability of my life. In October of 2005, after eight years and several failed treatments, it was determined that nothing more could be done for my mother. Over the next several months I watched as she withered away, living the last of her days with the feebleness of an old woman. When my mother lay too still in her sleep, I feared that I had lost her. And when she was awake, I was haunted by the images of her shivering violently in bed, the images blurred by the tears I tried to suppress in order to be strong for her, and the demoralizing feeling of helplessness that came with my inability to comfort her. I was torn emotionally. I wanted her suffering to end, but that meant losing her forever. May 17 was the night of the concert and however nervous I was, all I can remember about that night was my mother, still a mother despite her physical state, harassing me for not taking a shower. It was for her that I vowed I would perform the song. Mr. Benstein raised his baton and the melody of a bird song echoed from the flutes; the audience fell silent. The peaceful aura was broken by the minor chords of my clarinet, calling forth a looming presence. His baton strokes widened, and machine guns blasted from the snare drum, adding to the roaring of the brass tanks. My instrument emanated the cries of suffering, the notes shivering off my tongue. With the final upswing, he summoned the Hussite War song, and much of the pain that had built up inside my heart over the past months was lifted. My father told me later that he was deeply shaken by the piece as well. I realized that Music for Prague was not about the structure or the visual images it conjured, but instead it was the very lack of structure that allowed for Husa’s emotions to stand out. She passed away only a couple of hours after the performance. For the first time in months she looked at peace as she lay still in the presence of her family and I was able to accept that she was in a better place. It was Karel Husa’s ability to capture the loneliness and the pain of losing a loved one that allows Music for Prague to move us all. The rhythm and beat of music describe emotions not restricted by words, flowing together with the beating of the heart.",1,2.528520079,2.99973644,3.280599885,3.51819513,3.090024986,12.6,20.0,23.8,30.0,21.0
C0,158,"Music is capable of expressing emotion in ways that words often cannot. Whether it be joyful or sad, music has the power to evoke emotions that can transcend language and cultural barriers. However, what happens when the music lacks a tonal center or key? Can atonal music still convey emotion to the listener? As a classically trained pianist, I have had the opportunity to explore the world of atonal music. Atonality is defined as the absence of a tonal center or key, and it often results in dissonant and jarring sounds that can be challenging for some listeners. For many, atonality is simply considered to be noise, devoid of any emotional content. However, I believe that atonal music can express the full range of human emotion, just as tonal music can. To understand how atonal music can convey emotion, it is essential to look at the context in which it was created. Atonality emerged in the early 20th century during a period of great social, economic, and political upheaval. The chaos of World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the rise of fascism in Europe were all factors that contributed to this musical shift. Composers like Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Anton Webern rejected traditional tonal harmony, citing it as a relic of the past that no longer reflected their turbulent reality. These composers embraced atonal music as a means of expressing the dissonance and discord of their world. Atonality allowed these composers to create music that mirrored the uncertainty and discomfort of their surroundings. The dissonant and jarring sounds of atonal music were a reflection of the harsh realities of war, revolution, and political turmoil. A prime example of this is Schoenberg's seminal work, 'Pierrot Lunaire.' Composed in 1912, the piece is structured around a series of expressionist poems that explore themes of madness, death, and social alienation. The music is atonal, and the vocal part is sung in a style known as sprechgesang, which is a cross between speaking and singing. The result is a haunting and unsettling work that reflects the darkness of the human psyche. Schoenberg himself wrote, 'I had expressed the darkest experiences of my life in my music.' It is this intense emotional expression that makes atonal music so powerful. The lack of a tonal center allows the composer to break free from traditional harmony and create music that is entirely unbound by convention. Without the constraints of tonality, the composer is free to explore the full range of human emotion, from joy to sorrow, hope to despair. Of course, not all atonal music is dark and unsettling. Composers like Igor Stravinsky, who is known for his ballets 'The Firebird' and 'The Rite of Spring,' also embraced atonality. Stravinsky's use of atonal elements in these works allowed him to introduce a new level of complexity and depth to his music. The Rite of Spring, in particular, is an excellent example of the emotional depth that atonal music can convey. The ballet tells the story of a pagan ritual in which a young woman is chosen to dance herself to death as a sacrifice to the gods. The music is characterized by sharp rhythms, jagged melodies, and dissonant harmonies that mirror the brutal and violent nature of the ritual. Despite the absence of a tonal center, Stravinsky's music conveys a full range of emotions, from the primal energy of the opening to the haunting and mournful conclusion. In conclusion, atonal music has the power to convey emotions that are just as rich and complex as those found in tonal music. The lack of a tonal center allows the composer to break free from traditional harmony and explore the full range of human emotions. Whether it is the unsettling and haunting sounds of Schoenberg's 'Pierrot Lunaire' or the complex and powerful music of Stravinsky's 'The Rite of Spring,' atonal music can express emotion in ways that are just as profound as tonal music. As a musician, I have come to appreciate the emotional depth of atonal music. It has taught me that there are no limits to what music can do, and that even the most unsettling sounds can be beautiful and moving. My hope is that more people will explore the world of atonal music and discover the power that it has to convey the full range of human emotion.",0,2.654354388,2.882284893,3.108218093,3.374547291,3.039544443,14.0,19.0,22.0,25.0,20.5
C1,159,"As a high school senior who has dabbled in composing my own music, I have come to understand the value of atonal music in telling a story. Over time, I have come to realize that composing a piece of music that has an emotional impact on the listener requires more than just matching harmonies, and uplifting progressions. Years ago, my music teacher presented me with Music for Prague 1968 by Karel Husa, which at the time I thought to be a collection of jarring noises that made no sense. To an inexperienced person like myself, it sounded like a combination of a dozen angry beehives, and I struggled to digest the emotions and messages that lay beneath the composition's structure. However, my outlook changed in the summer of my junior year when I lost my beloved aunt. In the weeks following her passing, I found myself struggling emotionally and unable to express my feelings coherently while still making sense of my grief. Every time I sat at my piano, the emptiness inside me was too overpowering for me to put feelings into words or incorporate them into the music I played. For several months, I remained in a creative slump unable to find an outlet for my emotions. One day, I stumbled over Music for Prague on Spotify and listened to it without any real intentions. The familiar sounds of the clarinet that once confused me played on, and while still what seemed to be a mess of confusing sounds, it began to stir something in me. I replayed the song a second and third time, and every time it seemed to almost speak to me, conveying the feelings I couldn't articulate into sound. The discordant strings and flutes, the unexpected time signatures, and the heavy-handed percussions set me off with strong emotions of despair, restlessness, and uncertainty. I quickly realized that the structure of the song, or the lack of it, went a long way in conveying the composer's raw emotions. I found solace in Music for Prague, and the song taught me that music speaks a language that transcends words. Like how Schoenberg’s expressionist work “Pierrot Lunaire” conveyed themes of madness, death, and social alienation, Music for Prague was able to settle within me, tapping its way through every chord, finding a way to express my pain. In the same way, the classical genius, Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony was his way of expressing hope and triumph, in a time of great depression and confusion. The bottom line is that while atonal music provides a unique and different musical experience, it is capable of conveying emotions that are just as complex as those in tonal music. And like any other language, one must first learn how to listen and interpret what the melody or the notes are trying to say. Listening to pieces like Music for Prague, Pierrot Lunaire or The Rite of Spring without bias allows one to experience emotion in its rawest form, transcending the limitations of speech. In conclusion, atonal music is not just lifeless and mechanical noise as some may initially presume. The genre has its fair share of critics, and it is often looked down upon and misunderstood. Atonal music composers are often seen to lack the understanding of traditional composition theory when compared to the likes of Mozart or Beethoven. However, despite the initial lack of structure or tonal center, the genre has the power to speak to emotions that cannot be expressed in mere words. As composers, we must not shy away from expressing what we feel and utilize the infinite musical possibilities that exist. Those possibilities can express emotions in ways that go beyond the scripts and traditional harmonies. We must continue to push the boundaries of music, just like the great composers that came before us.",0,2.766451899,3.058206718,3.199005985,3.625309055,3.160475561,18.0,24.0,26.0,30.0,24.5
C2,160,"The sun was setting over the city, casting hues of purple and orange over the skyscrapers that dotted the skyline. My heart was heavy as I walked aimlessly down the bustling streets, trying to make sense of the emotions that were tearing through me. I had just received the devastating news that my grandfather had passed away, and I was struggling to find an outlet for my grief. As I wandered, the sounds of city life slowly began to fade into the background, replaced with the soft, subtle harmonies of atonal music that I had streaming through my earbuds. The notes were disjointed and unpredictable, swirling together in a sea of dissonance that was both beautiful and haunting. I had found solace in this genre of music before, and I turned to it once again, hoping that it could help me find a way to express the complex emotions that were roiling within me. Listening to the music, I found myself transported to another world, one where the rules of traditional composition no longer applied. The sounds were raw and untamed, free of the constraints of tonal structure, just like the emotions I was experiencing. With each passing note, I felt myself being drawn deeper into a state of contemplation, where the music and my thoughts became one. As the night grew darker around me, my thoughts turned to the composer of the music I was listening to, and I wondered what had inspired them to create such a hauntingly beautiful masterpiece. Had they experienced grief and loss themselves? Had they created this piece as a way to express emotions that could not be put into words? In that moment, I realized that atonal music was not just random noise, but a powerful tool for emotional expression. It had the ability to convey complex ideas and emotions in a way that traditional tonal music simply could not. Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire conveyed themes of madness, death, and social alienation, while Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring was full of primal energy and raw emotion. I thought back to my own experiences with atonal music and remembered the first time I had listened to Music for Prague 1968 by Karel Husa. I had been just a kid at the time, and I had been thoroughly confused by the jarring noises that made up the composition. But over time, I had come to appreciate the raw, emotional power of atonal music, and how it could speak to emotions that were just as complex as those in tonal music. Like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, At the atonal music's core was the idea of expressing hope and triumph in the face of great turmoil. Despite the initial lack of structure or tonal center, the genre had the power to speak to emotions that could not be expressed in mere words. You had to experience it. You had to feel it. In conclusion, atonal music may not be for everyone, but it is a genre that deserves respect and recognition. Composers who work in this style have much to offer in terms of emotional depth and expression, and it is up to us as listeners to approach their work with open minds and open hearts. When we do, we may find that atonal music speaks to us in ways that traditional tonal music cannot. It becomes more than just music - it is an experience that transcends the limitations of speech.",0,2.619792304,2.965849185,3.154931333,3.399539692,3.030137191,19.0,20.0,24.0,26.0,22.0
H,161,"We wanted to choreograph a tap dance like no one had ever seen before. We wanted to tell a story while we danced. We wanted to deliver a monologue. In the brainstorming session, Elyssa, our teacher, told us to think of a story, an experience, and to tell it not only through our words, but through our feet as well. I sat on the cold floor, my arms wrapped around my knees, and I wondered what story I should tell. I sifted through my memories, grasping for inspiration. Nothing. One by one, my friends stood before us, dancing their stories. First went James, his tap shoes ringing out like pealing bells against the springy floor, telling a funny story about doctors. Then Sally, her beautiful red hair, newly cut, swinging and swaying along with her and her bubbly tale of band camp. Then Katie, intricately weaving a pattern across the floor, speaking about her open heart surgery. Then my little sister, the youngest one there, timidly striking her feet against the ground, quietly recounting the time she and my father had gotten lost canoeing. Finally, it was my turn. I was the last to go, and I still had a hundred stories racing through my head. I stood up and slowly walked across the long room, my tap shoes clickety-clacking with every step. Out of the corner of my eye, I watched my reflection follow me in the mirror. I turned around and faced five pairs of expectant eyes. Of their own accord my feet took up a rhythm: ba da dum bum, ba da dum bum. And above the metallic sound of my tapping flew a story I hadn’t consciously chosen; a story I had been keeping locked tightly away from even my deepest thoughts. As I realized what I was saying, my feet quickened and the tapping grew more frantic. But the tapping couldn’t drown out my words; a story about my grandmother. I began with the surprise visit my mother and I decided to pay. I told of the window through which I watched my grandmother fall. I told of the glass door, the locked glass door, and my grandmother’s slumped form lying unmoving on the floor with just a door barring us from her. And my mother, my clean-mouthed mother, cursing and struggling to find a key, finally finding it and thrusting the door open. The two of us rushing to help my grandmother, me a few steps behind, unsure of what to do, of what was going on. As I told the story, my feet and words felt clumsy and I didn't know what they would do or say next. Five pairs of eyes, full of pity, watched me. I choked on the words. My feet faltered. But I had begun, and now I had to see it through. I described the sour smell of alcohol seeping out of my grandmother’s very pores; the blood, the crimson translucent blood, puddled and smeared across the floor. And worst of all, her eyes, bleary and unfocused, facing in different directions. I told of my own eyes, wide as steering wheels. Blood oozed out of the cut on her head. And my grandmother — my grandma — tried to act as though nothing had ­happened, as though she weren’t drunk, as though she wasn’t an alcoholic. My tapping faded out after the words had finally stopped running out of my mouth. The tale hadn’t been told in a cohesive manner and my dancing had been disjointed. But my story was out in the open. And as I stood there, I suddenly felt naked. I was utterly exposed. I had dug up a piece of my soul that I suddenly wasn’t sure I should have uncovered. Even an hour later, riding shotgun in my mother’s minivan, with the trees flying past me, I felt as though a piece of me had been scooped out and left for the vultures. But miraculously, after I got beyond my feelings of vulnerability, my wound started to mend. It was as though by telling the story I had let out an infection. My anger toward my grandmother was scabbing over; my resentment was being changed into a small scar. And even though none of the people who had heard my story ever brought it up again, sharing that small piece of myself with them allowed me to accept what had happened and to heal.",1,2.234518137,2.625954795,2.766578885,3.050606821,2.719140196,9.0,13.0,16.6,21.8,15.0
C0,162,"As I stepped onto the hardwood floor of the dance studio, I felt a sense of peace wash over me. The tap shoes, worn from years of use, clicked against the floor, and my body began to move to the rhythm of the music. Tap dance has been my refuge for the past eight years, allowing me to escape from the stresses of the world and find healing for my mind and body. Growing up, I struggled with anxiety and depression. I often felt like I was drowning in a sea of negative emotions, unable to find a way to swim to the surface. My parents tried to help me by sending me to therapy, but nothing seemed to alleviate the constant pressure I felt on my chest until I discovered tap dance. My first tap class was like nothing I had experienced before. The music was vibrant, the rhythms were intricate, and my body moved in ways that I never thought possible. I felt a rush of endorphins as I danced, and for the first time in my life, I felt free from my anxiety and depression. It was as if the tapping sound of my shoes was releasing layers of pent-up emotions that were trapped inside me. I was hooked. Over the past eight years, tap dance has become much more than just a hobby. It has become a form of personal healing that has transformed every aspect of my life. Through tap dance, I have learned to accept and embrace my vulnerabilities, and to use them as a catalyst for growth and change. Tap dance has taught me that each sound I create with my feet is a unique celebration of who I am. It has allowed me to connect with my emotions in a way that I never thought possible, and to express my feelings without the use of words. When I dance, I am no longer a victim of my negative thoughts and emotions, but instead, I become an active participant in my own healing. In addition to its emotional benefits, tap dance has also helped me to develop a sense of discipline and focus in my life. The rhythms and choreography of tap require precision and attention to detail, which has encouraged me to work on my mental and physical agility. I have learned to be patient with myself and to trust the process of growth and transformation. Perhaps most importantly, tap dance has given me a sense of community and belonging. The tap dance world is a tight-knit group of individuals who all share a passion for the art form. The people I have met through tap dance have become my closest friends, and the shared experience of dance has brought us together in a way that words cannot describe. Tap dance has brought so much joy and healing into my life that I cannot imagine who I would be without it. It has allowed me to develop a love and appreciation for myself that I never had before, and has given me the courage to pursue my dreams and aspirations. I plan to continue my study of tap dance in college and beyond, and to use my experience to help others who may be struggling with their own mental health issues. I hope to become a tap dance instructor and mentor, teaching others the healing power of dance and helping them to find their own personal refuge through tap. In conclusion, tap dance has been an integral part of my healing journey. It has allowed me to connect with my emotions, develop a sense of discipline, and find a sense of community and belonging. Most importantly, it has given me a way to express myself and to transform my negative emotions into a source of growth and empowerment. Through tap dance, I have learned to love myself and to cherish all that I am. I am grateful for this powerful personal outlet, and I plan to continue to use it to make a difference in the world.",0,2.649768737,2.75188054,2.934903289,3.140818012,2.780329962,16.0,21.0,23.0,26.8,22.5
C1,163,"Growing up, I was fascinated with tap dancing. I found myself drawn to the sound of my shoes hitting the ground, the beat, and syncopation, and the freedom that came with the dance. But it wasn't until a high school choreography session that I realized the true power of tap dancing and the impact it had on my grandmother's life. My grandmother was a remarkable woman who had faced adversity throughout her life. Born in 1930s America, she grew up in a segregated community where she attended a segregated school and worked in a segregated workplace. Despite these trials, she never lost her spirit and love of life. As a young woman, tap dancing was one way that she could express herself and connect with others who shared her passion. As I started learning about my grandmother's experiences, I began to see tap dancing in a new light. It was no longer just about the joy of movement and performance but a symbol of perseverance, community, and the power of art in the face of adversity. And as I learned more about her experiences and passion, I began to view tap dancing as an art form that preserves stories for generations to come. During one of my grandmother's visits, she showed my family and me a tap routine that she had performed for a local event. Watching her, I could see and hear the story of her life woven into every step, every sound. The sound of her shoes striking the ground echoed her lifelong struggles and hardships, creating a song of resilience and strength. As I watched her, I felt proud to be a part of her family, and I realized tap dance is an integral part of our shared history. As I continued to learn about tap dance and its evolution through history, I saw how it was a way for marginalized communities to communicate and express themselves. During the slave era, enslaved people incorporated African rhythms and dance movements into tap as a way to evade slave masters' scrutiny. During the civil rights movement, tap dance was used to protest discrimination and segregation. Today, tap dancing continues to evolve, reflecting the current world's realities, and telling stories of oppression, resistance, and cultural identity. It is a source of community where people of all ages and backgrounds share their art forms' passion and tell their own stories. My grandmother's connection to tap dance was a window to a world that I might have never known otherwise, teaching me about the strength of the human spirit and art's power to connect and inspire. In a way, tap dance is a perfect metaphor for my grandmother's life. She faced incredible obstacles and hardships, but through her love of tap dancing and her connection with others who shared that passion, she found a way to overcome them. Her story is a living testament to the resilience of the human spirit. As I prepare to transition to college, I will take the life lessons from my grandmother's story with me, the power of art in preserving and sharing our stories, and the importance of resilience in the face of trials. I will continue exploring tap dance and other art forms to share stories and build connections with others. As I move forward in life, I will always carry the lessons from tap dance and my grandmother's story with me. In conclusion, tap dance is a powerful expression that transcends language, culture, and time. It speaks to the human condition, shares stories and experiences. It is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit and the power of art to uplift and inspire. Through my grandmother's love for tap dance, I found my own passion, and stories that I will cherish for years to come. I hope to continue tapping to preserve and share stories, create a sense of community, and inspire others in their path towards greatness.",0,2.725120943,3.003917146,3.242129585,3.317435056,3.041631232,14.0,20.0,23.0,27.0,22.0
C2,164,"The room was dark, the only sound coming from the musician on the stage. The spotlight cast a glow on the dancer's shoes, illuminating the shiny metal plates reflecting the inky darkness. As the music began to swell, the dancer stepped forward and began to move, creating a song with the intricate beats, rhythms, and sounds of her shoes. The sound was unlike anything I had heard before, each tap creating a rich, sonorous tone that filled the room with life. Each movement of her body was precise, fluid, and powerful, conjuring images of strength, resilience, and perseverance. It wasn't until later that I fully understood the power of tap dance and the impact it had on my grandmother's life. Born in a time of segregation, my grandmother had few opportunities to express herself, but tap dance was one way that she could connect with others who shared her passion. The tap of her shoes against the ground echoed her lifelong struggles, creating a cacophony of narratives that spoke to the strength of the human spirit. As I watched my grandmother perform her routine, I could see and hear the story of her life woven into every step, every sound. Her love for tap dance was a window to a world that I might have never known otherwise, teaching me about the importance of art in preserving and sharing our stories.

H,165,"I was sitting on the floor of a stall in a barn tucked away on one hundred acres of land in central Pennsylvania. Lying next to me was a very pregnant Ayrshire cow weighing well over 1,000 pounds. Petoria didn't scare me. I was used to being in such close proximity to her. She was my favorite cow at Hameau Farm. My third year there as a camper, I had shown Petoria in the farm show at the end of the session. Now she was quite a bit bigger, and very frightened. It was her first calf, and she didn't really understand what was about to happen. Thirty curious girls surrounded the calm haven that I had created in the stall for Petoria. The campers watched through the bars of the stall, waiting quietly and patiently for something to happen. I thought back to five years before, when I had first seen a calf being born. The mother was out in the pasture, so my friends and I watched in awe and anticipation as the massive creature lay down on her side and started pushing. A new calf was always an exciting change at the farm. Chores were put on hold as we wondered at the slimy, skinny animal trying to take its first steps. The day Petoria went into labor, the girls were supposed to go to the state park for a barbeque and a swim, but they chose unanimously to stay and watch Petoria bring her first baby into the world. These are the kinds of girls that come to Hameau Farm: inquisitive, hardworking, independent girls who would rather spend two weeks feeding a baby goat with a bottle than splashing around in a town pool with their friends or playing soccer for their travel team. Even though my days as a camper ended long ago, I still consider myself a Hameau Farm girl, and this was my ­seventh summer. For the moment my place was in the stall, sitting in the hay with Petoria. She let out a soft moo, and I stroked her soft brown-spotted coat. She was ready. I moved aside so that she could lie on her side, first coaxing her to the center of the stall so that the campers would get a good view. She started pushing. A series of hushed whispers rippled through the line of young girls. I loved that they were so excited. These were a bunch of city girls who had been dropped off almost a week ago, not knowing what to expect, but willing to try something new. I thought back to my first week at camp, and how I hadn’t even known how to wash my own dishes. When it was my chore group’s turn in the kitchen after dinner, I not only learned how to scrub, rinse and sanitize, but by the end of the night, I learned how to make the perfect beard out of soap bubbles, and I picked up some great dance moves to Britney Spears songs. Everything was an adventure at camp, and today was proving to be no exception. Petoria was breathing harder. I could see the feet starting to emerge. I knew that the front hooves would come out first and the calf would literally dive out of its mother. This calf had some of the biggest feet I had ever seen, and Petoria had clearly noticed as well. As pushing got harder, Petoria became more vocal, and then she stopped. She was out of energy, but she needed to push or the calf ­wouldn’t survive. I tried to feed her grain and give her water, but Petoria would have none of it. She was exhausted. After deferring to the camp director, I had to gather up twine from the bales of hay around the barn, tie them together, and tie the long string around the calf's exposed hooves. It was my turn to do the work. I pulled on the twine, but couldn't get a good grip on it. My fellow counselor and I tied our end of the rope around a pitchfork. That provided us with at least a little leverage. Three of us pulled on that handle for what seemed like an hour. By then there was no point in trying to keep the campers quiet and relaxed. They were all concerned, shouting words of encouragement to Petoria and clapping and cheering whenever a little more of the calf emerged. It is a Hameau Farm custom to name a new baby animal something starting with the first letter of its mother’s name, so when that little bull calf finally came out of Petoria, the campers voted, and we named him Presley, after The King. He was the center of attention for days after, but as I made my way down to the farmhouse to shower away the slime, dirt, and sawdust, I knew that he was just one of the many adventures that each one of those campers would have at Hameau Farm.",1,2.268762869,2.606724755,2.865523033,3.200036622,2.733054185,9.0,14.0,17.0,24.0,15.0
C0,166,"As I find myself wandering the vast expanse of my family’s property in rural Connecticut, surrounded by the idyllic beauty of nature, the sounds of chirping birds and the unmistakable scent of freshly cut grass and farm animals, I stumble upon a rare and remarkable sight. I see a few cows grazing in the nearby pasture, and one is noticeably restless, lying down and moaning in apparent discomfort. I realize with a jolt that I am witnessing firsthand a true miracle of life: a cow giving birth. I had read about countless births in my biology textbooks and seen my fair share of birthing videos, but nothing could have prepared me for the raw and uncut experience of seeing it all happen in front of me. All around me, nature had a way of showing me what it means to witness something truly special and wonderful, outside of my own control. The cow lay on her side, some way into labor, and I watched in awe as she strained to push out her calf. My heart was racing with excitement and anticipation as I tried to take in every detail of the birth. With each push, the calf’s legs finally emerged, followed by its head, until the entire body was revealed. I was amazed by the resilience of the cow, pushing and groaning with valiant determination to see her precious calf safely delivered into this world. As I witnessed this magical moment, my thoughts turned to my own journey in life, and how it is just as miraculous and unexpected as the birth of that calf. Like the cow, we all have a story, one that is marked by our unique journey and set of experiences. This experience has helped me realize how much adversity we face in our lives and how important it is to come out on the other end with a positive outlook. As I continued to take in the scene before me, I was struck by another realization, one that perhaps had been hiding in plain sight all along. I thought about the many ways in which we could all learn from the animals around us, about their strength and resilience in the face of adversity, and their sense of purpose and belonging in the world. I reflected on how the cow, without any formal education or preconceived notions, knew exactly what to do in every moment during the birthing process. Her instincts kicked in, aided by the support of the other cows in the herd, and she was able to bring forth new life without hesitation or self-doubt. In comparison, we humans often overthink and complicate things, second-guessing our own abilities and allowing self-doubt to limit us. But witnessing this natural process of life has given me a newfound respect for the simple yet profound power of nature and its wisdom. As I stood there, mesmerized by this wondrous event, I realized that every single one of us is blessed with an innate sense of curiosity and wonder, a deep-rooted sense of purpose that fuels us to discover new things and push beyond our limits. Just like the cow who was embarking on the journey of motherhood for the very first time, we all have the capacity for perseverance and determination, as long as we have faith in ourselves and trust in our own instincts. As I look back on that day, I am amazed at how witnessing the birth of that calf has given me a newfound appreciation for the beauty and diversity of life around us. It has also inspired me to be more aware of the natural world and its intricate workings, to try and understand the many nuances and complexities of our world, and to never take a single moment for granted. In conclusion, witnessing the birth of a calf has been a transformative experience in my life, one that has helped me realize the true value of perseverance, resilience, and the power of nature itself. It has shown me that no matter how difficult or uncertain our journey might be, we can all learn from the world around us and trust in our own abilities to make it through. Like the cow in labor, we are all capable of bringing forth new life and creating a better, more compassionate world.",0,2.904089431,3.002033537,3.333818035,3.64657685,3.165158966,20.8,25.0,30.0,37.2,27.0
C1,167,"Growing up on a farm has taught me valuable lessons that have shaped who I am today. One particular experience has been etched in my memory, and it taught me valuable lessons about overcoming fear, personal responsibility, and strength. I was at Hameau Farm, in central Pennsylvania sitting in a stall with a very pregnant Ayrshire cow named Petoria. I had been a camper at the farm for three years, and Petoria was my favorite cow. On this day, she was in labor with her first calf, and thirty curious girls had gathered around the stall, watching and waiting for something to happen. As Petoria started pushing, I thought back to when I had witnessed my first calf being born years before. I fondly remembered the awe and excitement that the new calf had brought to our farm. The campers at Hameau Farm were just as curious and hardworking as I had been as a camper years before. They were willing to try something new, and instead of visiting the state park for a barbeque and a swim, they had chosen to stay and watch Petoria bring her first baby into the world. As the calf began emerging, Petoria became exhausted and stopped pushing. I realized that I was going to have to step up and help. After deferring to the camp director, I rallied fellow counselors, tied together twine, and pulled on the rope with all the strength we had. After hours that felt like an eternity, we managed to deliver a healthy bull calf. The sense of accomplishment I felt was indescribable. I had not only helped bring new life into the world, but I had also faced my fears, taken on personal responsibility, and found new strength within myself. This experience taught me that overcoming fear and embracing responsibility is the key to personal growth. The calf was named Presley after The King, a Hameau Farm tradition. He became the center of attention for days, but I knew that this experience would stay with each of those campers forever. As I look back on this experience, I realize that the lessons I learned in that stall are applicable to my life beyond the farm. I know that facing challenges head-on, collaborating with others to achieve meaningful goals, and asking for help when necessary are essential to personal growth and success. As I apply to Yale and Harvard, I will draw on this experience to showcase my determination, personal responsibility, and ability to work with others. I know that the lessons I learned at Hameau Farm are valuable and will serve me well as I continue to pursue my dreams in college and beyond. In conclusion, Hameau Farm was more than just a summer camp for me; it was a place of personal growth, where I learned valuable life lessons that have shaped who I am today. Helping deliver a calf, facing my fears head-on, and collaborating with others to achieve a goal has taught me valuable lessons that will stay with me for the rest of my life. I know that these experiences have prepared me for the challenges and opportunities in life, and I am eager to continue to grow, learn, and inspire others to do the same.",0,2.858232963,3.081557589,3.198750573,3.505157136,3.113251606,15.8,19.6,24.4,28.0,22.0
C2,168,"It's early morning, the sun is just beginning to rise and the soft orange light spills across the land, casting long shadows on the grass. The air is crisp and cool, and a light dew covers the foliage. On the family farm, for the past couple of months, we have been expecting a new calf. It has been a long and arduous journey for the cow, full of ups and downs, much like the journey of life. But, remarkably, she has managed to hang on, like a fighter holding on against a determined opponent. This cow has demonstrated a resilience that has inspired me and such inspiration will take me to great heights as I enter college. Every day, as I have watched her, I am struck by the cow's strength and tenacity. She has overcome a variety of challenges, from the cold winter to the summer heatwaves, to diseases and predators. She has become a symbol of hope and determination, and an embodiment of the challenges we all face in our lives. She has shown me the importance of resilience and perseverance, and how, when faced with obstacles, we must stand firm in our determination to achieve our goals. One morning, I heard a sound that brought me out of my bed. The sound of the cow's labor. The sun had just set, and the fields were bathed in the orange glow of the evening. I hurried to where my family was, who were also aware of the sound of labor. The cow was uncomfortable, her breathing was long, and her screams filled the air. It quickly became clear that the calf was not coming, the abysmal and protracted birth had gone on for hours. This was a critical moment, and my father knew that he had to step in to help. He had years of experience delivering cows, and he knew just what needed to be done. My father got to work, meticulously planning out the calf’s position, carefully alternating between pulling and relaxing, methodically making small adjustments to create room for the calf. The cow would scream as if she knew what was happening, but it was clear she couldn't do anything to help. The birth was not easy, but perseverance and dedication won the day. Finally, after a hard-fought struggle, the calf was born. In this moment, I realized that just like the cow, we all have our struggles, and it is up to us to persevere and overcome them. The birthing cow's journey may have seemed long and challenging, but it taught me a lesson in resilience and perseverance; the knowledge that, with hard work, dedication, and determination, anything is possible. As I approach college and take on new challenges, I will look back on this experience and remind myself that I can persevere through anything. I will be ready for whatever challenges come my way, confident in my ability to push through and emerge victorious. I will be the birthing cow, facing challenges head-on, and persisting despite hardships, knowing that in the end, my hard work and perseverance will be rewarded. In conclusion, the birthing cow on my family's property has become a symbol of strength and resilience in my life. Through its struggles and determination, I have learned that anything is possible with grit, determination, and perseverance.

H,169,"You can make almost anything out of LEGOs. You can build miniature spaceships, colorful forts, or cities of blocky skyscrapers that span the basement floor. My favorite was constructing ancient, booby-trapped temples like the ones from Indiana Jones. In elementary school, I was fanatical about my LEGOs. I would build the medieval castle, complete with the moat and the drawbridge and guard stations and the throne room for the king and queen and their royal dog, Patches. (Coincidentally, Patches was also the name of my dog.) I would kneel for hours, hunched over the hundreds of blocks spread over the carpet, to select just the right piece for each part of the structure. Once the castle walls were erected and the knights on horseback were set to approach from the other side of the moat, I was done. I didn't really play with the castle afterward. I moved it to the corner so that my sister’s Barbie convertible wouldn't crash into it and ruin my little “Ages 3 and Up” masterpiece. Looking back on my childhood, I was a bizarrely obsessive little kid. For days after building a fort or a spaceship, I would stop and examine that every plastic block was still in place. It’s strange to think that between the age of riding a tricycle and the age of driving a car, I am, in some ways, exactly the same. I don't play with LEGOs anymore, but I am a construction worker of types. Now I write essays and stories and newspaper articles, and I approach it with the same compulsion. Every word is painstakingly selected with the same intensity I exerted as a child choosing the right color block. Every phrase is turned around and around in my head like arranging the walls of the castle gate. Every sentence is examined for its structural quality. At my desk — like kneeling over my rug — I craft meticulously. By writing, I hope to create the grand and intricate images in my mind, to give them some physical incarnation. Inked on a page, a nebulous mass of related thoughts can be forged into something real. A story or essay can be erected as the fulfillment of a single concept. My gratification comes from being able to perfectly embody an idea. This can be frustrating because I’ve never written anything close to perfect. For as much as I agonize over my words and methodically rework every draft, my ideal eludes me. Still, I return to my desk and keep writing, editing, and rewriting because if I don’t return to my desk, I’m sure I’ll never write the essays, stories, and newspaper articles that I know I want to write. You can make almost anything out of words. You can build planet-sized spaceships, long-lost medieval castles, or cities of glass structures that pierce the clouds. If my construction work is solid enough, I believe I will be able to make these worlds — real and imaginary — come alive on paper the way they did on the rug of my basement. So I continue to build — block by block, word by word, sentence by sentence — in the hope that I will end up with something I can put to the side of my desk and examine every once in a while to see that every word fits in place.",1,2.485268591,2.834896881,3.053460423,3.332572798,2.927733233,10.6,14.0,18.0,25.4,17.0
C0,170,"As a child, my favorite toy was LEGOs. I spent countless hours building structures and vehicles, taking them apart and starting over again. I loved the feeling of creating something out of nothing, of being in control of the final product. Now, as a high school senior, I've come to realize that building with words is not so different from building with LEGOs. Both require imagination, precision, and persistence. Writing has always been a passion of mine. When I was younger, I used to scribble stories onto pieces of paper and pass them around to my classmates. As I grew older, my writing became more polished and I began to realize that words had a power beyond just communication. They could inspire, move, and motivate. Just as you can't build a LEGO castle without first having a vision, you can't write a meaningful essay without a clear idea of what you want to say. When I sit down to write, I start by brainstorming ideas and scribbling notes. I try to imagine the finished product in my mind and then work backwards, figuring out what steps I need to take to get there. Once I have a loose outline, I start building my essay piece by piece. Each sentence and paragraph is like a new LEGO block, carefully chosen and placed. I pay close attention to the flow of my writing, making sure each idea leads logically to the next. Just as with LEGOs, each piece needs to fit together perfectly, or the entire structure will crumble. But building an essay is not just about precision. It's also about creativity. Just as there are endless possibilities for what you can build with LEGOs, there are countless ways to approach a writing prompt. I try to think outside the box and come up with unique angles and ideas. For example, when I was tasked with writing an essay about a person who had inspired me, I could have taken the predictable route and written about a family member or teacher. Instead, I chose to write about an artist I had never met but whose work had deeply impacted my life. I used vivid language to describe her paintings, drawing parallels to my own experiences and struggles. In doing so, I was able to create a heartfelt and original piece of writing. Of course, building with words is not always easy. There are times when I get stuck or frustrated, when I can't seem to find the right words to express what I want to say. But just as with LEGOs, persistence is key. I keep pushing myself to try new things and experiment with different forms of expression. For example, when I was preparing to write my college essay, I knew I wanted to say something meaningful and authentic about my identity as a first-generation American. But I didn't want to fall into the trap of clichés and stereotypes. So, I decided to write a poem instead of a traditional essay. At first, I didn't know if it would work. But as I started to build my poem, piece by piece, I realized that it was the perfect form for capturing the complexity of my experience. I was able to express my emotions and ideas in a way that felt authentic and organic, and I ultimately received glowing feedback from my college advisors. As I prepare to apply to selective universities like Yale and Harvard, I know that my love of language and creative persistence will serve me well. Just as with LEGOs, building with words requires patience, focus, and attention to detail. But it also requires something more: the ability to imagine a vision and bring it to life, one block or word at a time. In the end, whether it's a towering LEGO castle or a compelling college essay, the goal is the same: to create something that is both beautiful and meaningful, something that stands the test of time. I am excited to continue building with words as I pursue my academic and personal goals, and I can't wait to see where my imagination takes me next.",0,2.337186396,2.597270704,2.814058322,3.021319867,2.654343314,9.0,15.0,19.8,25.4,16.0
C1,171,"The act of crafting and building with one's hands is one of the most satisfying experiences a person can have. For many, this takes the form of creating elaborate structures with LEGOs, while for others, it is the art of writing that helps bring their ideas to life. For me, it was building castles and spaceships with LEGOs as a child that paved the way for my interest in writing. As a child, I used to spend hours building medieval castles that would impress even the most skilled architects. From the drawbridge to the throne room, each detail was meticulously crafted, and every brick was perfectly placed. The satisfaction I felt upon completing a project was immense, but it was the creative process itself that made building with LEGOs so rewarding. Now, as a high school senior preparing to apply to top-tier universities, I find myself drawing heavily on the skills cultivated during my childhood. Writing has become my new form of construction. Every word, sentence, and paragraph is approached with the same obsessive attention to detail that I applied to building castles out of LEGOs. Just as building with LEGOs requires structure, so too does writing. Whether constructing a castle or crafting an essay, a clear plan of action is essential. One must be able to visualize the final product, and then work step-by-step to bring that vision to life. With LEGOs, this meant selecting the right bricks and putting them together in exactly the right way. With writing, it means outlining a clear and logical argument and then working to support that argument throughout the essay. Another key similarity between building with LEGOs and writing is the importance of creative expression. Both activities require a certain level of imaginative thinking and originality. Just as I would use my LEGOs to construct elaborate fortresses that no one had ever seen before, writing allows me to express my ideas in a way that is unique and compelling. Whether I am writing a research paper on a complex topic or a personal reflection on my own experiences, I strive to bring my own voice and perspective to the page. As with building with LEGOs, writing requires patience and perseverance. The first draft of any given essay or story is rarely perfect, and it often takes many revisions before a final product is achieved. The ability to embrace this iterative process is essential. The satisfaction of building with LEGOs never came from the immediate success, but rather, the journey itself. Similarly, the satisfaction that comes from writing is found in the process of crafting and refining one's ideas. Perhaps most importantly, both building with LEGOs and writing require a willingness to take risks. It can be easy to follow a tried-and-true formula when building with LEGOs or writing essays, but true success comes from taking risks and trying new things. Whether this means experimenting with a new color or building technique with LEGOs, or playing with form and style when writing, stepping outside of one's comfort zone is essential for growth and improvement. As I look towards the future, I am grateful for the skills and experiences that building with LEGOs have instilled in me. Even more so, I am grateful for the opportunity to apply these skills in the field of writing. As I prepare to submit my college applications, I am confident that the lessons learned through building with LEGOs will serve me well in this next phase of my life. No matter where my creativity takes me in the future, I will always cherish everything I learned while building with LEGOs. At the core of every successful essay or LEGO creation is a dedication to organization, imagination, perseverance, and risk-taking. In conclusion, I believe that LEGOs and writing share more in common than one might initially think. Both require a certain level of imaginative thinking, patience, perseverance, and risk-taking. As someone who has enjoyed constructing elaborate castles out of blocks and crafting compelling essays, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to develop these skills in childhood. By embracing the same sense of creativity and attention to detail from my LEGO days, I am ready to tackle the challenges of the future with confidence and excitement.",0,2.679978624,2.829219576,3.082344871,3.312363273,2.946392546,15.0,18.0,21.4,27.2,19.0
C2,172,"The smell of freshly opened LEGO bricks can still transport me back to my childhood days, where I spent hours upon hours creating intricate structures of all shapes and sizes. From towering fortresses to sleek spaceships, each project was driven by my own ambitious imagination. And while I may have traded in my colorful bricks for a keyboard, the passion and dedication I developed while building with LEGOs continue to propel me forward in all of my creative endeavors. I remember the satisfying clack of two bricks snapping into place, the smoothness of each block's edges, and the subtle resistance before a piece finally clicked into place. As I shuffled through my collection of blocks, searching for just the right piece to add onto my latest creation, my mind raced. I was imagining a medieval castle with tall towers and hidden passageways, an impenetrable fortress that would impress all who saw it. Creating a castle with LEGOs was no small feat. It required planning, patience, and meticulous attention to detail. The same skills are essential to crafting a successful essay. Each introduction, body paragraph, and conclusion must be carefully crafted to build a persuasive argument. Every word counts, every sentence must be placed with utmost care to create the desired effect. When building a LEGO castle, I followed a plan step-by-step, and in the process, I learned valuable lessons about organization. This same skill has served me well as a writer, where outlining and editing are crucial to a well-structured essay. And after years of constructing with bricks, I learned to approach every project with a sense of organization that keeps me focused and on-task, both as a writer and as a person. Perhaps the most crucial skill I developed while building with LEGOs was the power of imagination. To create something unique and special requires that extra spark, that boldness to venture into new territory. By piecing together a vast array of LEGO pieces, I learned how to be creative on the spot, crafting new designs that no one had ever seen before. Writing demands the same creativity. With each essay, I approach it with the same imaginative flair that I used when creating with bricks. It’s easy to fall into a writing routine or formula, but true success comes from taking chances and stepping out of my comfort zone. Experimenting with new forms and styles, or pushing boundaries with new ideas, these are all steps I’ve learned to take thanks to my time as a LEGO builder. But none of this would have been possible without the perseverance and grit developed while building with LEGOs. Even the most well-designed castle takes time and patience to bring to fruition. And so it’s been with my writing as well. Writing is a process, one that often requires multiple revisions and adjustments to get just right. But I’ve learned to embrace this iterative process, seeking satisfaction in the refinement of each draft, every word and sentence honed to perfection. Finally, building with LEGOs taught me the value of taking risks. When I was just starting out, it was easy to follow the directions on the box, assemble the model piece-by-piece, and call it a day. But to truly excel, I had to push beyond these parameters, to explore for myself what was possible. Now, as a senior in high school preparing to apply to top colleges, I am once again staring down the unknown, but with the same sense of excitement and wonder that once drove me to tinker and create with my favorite plastic bricks. I understand that I will face challenges and obstacles along the way, but I am confident that the skills and knowledge that I’ve honed over the years building with LEGOs and writing essays will be more than enough to see me through. I have learned that no matter the task, whether building castles out of LEGOs or crafting persuasive essays, a dedication to organized planning, imagination, perseverance, and risk-taking will get you far. Indeed, each new challenge offers an opportunity to innovate, to show the world what you're capable of. And that, more than anything, is the real value of a childhood spent building with LEGOs – an ability to apply creativity, ingenuity, and design-thinking to any task. At the end of the day, it is not just the skills that I honed that is invaluable, but the sense of joy and wonder that came with each new creation. Whether it’s constructing castles from LEGO bricks or crafting essays, the process remains the same – a celebration of human creativity and imagination, the pure joy of bringing something new and unique into the world.",0,2.660582452,2.920486234,3.195793922,3.486630374,3.067749952,15.0,18.0,23.0,30.0,20.0
H,173,"The white yarn slipped off my aluminium crochet hook, adding a single crochet to rows and rows of existing stitches, that looked to be in the form of a blob. Staring at the image of the little unicorn amigurumi lit up on the screen of my laptop, and looking back at the UMO (unidentified messy object) number five, I was extremely perplexed. This had seemed so easy. Round 1, construct a magic circle with 6 single crochets. Done. Round 2 was an increase round resulting in a total of 12 stitches. Also done. The remaining rounds were blurred into hours and minutes that should have resulted in a little white creature in the likeness of a unicorn, but sitting on my desk (much like the four days before today) was a pool of tangled white yarn. It was not until day seven that a creature with a lopsided head whose horn was the only identifier of the mythical being emerged. Very much like learning how to crochet, my journey in forging my own path and finding a passion was confusing, messy and at times infuriating. Even in primary school, I had heard all the stories of individuals finding their own route in life. I had been told stories of those who found their passion at a young age and were exceptionally proficient at their craft, of those that abandoned their interests and pursued a lucrative career, even those who chose their dreams but regretted it afterwards. This weighed heavily on me, as I was determined to have a success story as many of my other family members had. The only problem was that I did not have a direction. In the years following primary school, I stepped out of my comfort zone in a frenzy to find a passion. I joined the school orchestra where I played the violin, and a debate class to practice public speaking and become much more eloquent. At my ballet school, I branched out to contemporary and jazz dance. I stuffed myself with experience similar to an amigurumi engorged with batting. I found myself enjoying all of those activities but soon enough, I was swamped with extracurriculars. Just like the tangles of white yarn on my desk, I was pulled in all directions. I still felt lost. To make things worse, it seemed as if everyone else had found their path in life, and they had all become white unicorns while I was still doubting the stitch I just made. It was not until high school that I realised that I could view this mission to find a passion from another perspective. While successfully completing a crochet project is an accomplishment itself, the motions of making slip knots, single or double crochets takes you on an adventure as well. The knots that I had encountered in my craft were evidence of my experiences and what shaped me as an individual. My exploration of various paths through detours may have sometimes resulted in roadblocks, but I continued to persevere and learn from my experiences, applying the skills that I have gained to future knots. The mini adventures that I went on were all crucial to me in the greater journey of life. Through trial and error, the current adventure that I am on resonates the most with me, taking me down the path of service and environmental activism. However, I have learnt that no one path is static, and I can be on more than one path at a time. While I may only be halfway to the proportionate unicorn amigurumi that some others may have already achieved, I still have so much to learn and so much that I want to learn, and so my journey to grow continues.",1,2.669981467,2.848840779,3.096748445,3.541962158,2.928347982,11.8,18.0,22.4,30.4,21.5
C0,174,"There is no doubt that life is a journey with its ups and downs. Every person experiences a unique path in which they face challenges, obstacles, and opportunities. For me, finding my passion was not an easy task, and it took me a while to realize what I was truly passionate about. Growing up, I always had an interest in the arts. I took part in school plays, performance competitions and was involved in my school's art club. However, as I reached high school, I started to feel the pressure to excel in academics, especially in STEM fields. I began to believe that pursuing a degree in a STEM field was the only way that I could succeed in life. So, being the person that I was, I took all the AP courses in math and science, and my schedule was filled with STEM classes. The problem was, I wasn't passionate about any of them. I was merely going through the motions, trying to please my parents and the expectations set forth before me. It wasn't until my junior year when I took a course on creative writing that I realized how much I missed the arts. The course allowed me to explore my creativity, and I found myself enjoying every moment of it. I spent hours writing, editing, and perfecting my work, and for the first time in a long time, I was excited about something. I continued to take more writing courses, joined writing clubs, and even started a blog where I could express my thoughts and opinions. As I immersed myself in the writing world, I realized that writing was not just an activity for me but a passion. It was a medium through which I could express myself, share my stories, and make a difference in the world. However, my journey did not end there. As I continued to explore my passion for writing, I found that my interests extended beyond just creative writing. I became keenly interested in journalism, my school's newspaper pointed the way to the world of journalism, and I interned at a magazine company. I realized how much I enjoyed the chase of chasing down stories, interviewing people, and writing non-fiction stories. Through my journey, I realized that finding passion is not a one-time event. It is a continuous process that requires one to step out of their comfort zone, try new things, and reflect on their experiences. It is okay to change direction or explore new paths, as long as one stays true to oneself. Finding my passion for writing and journalism was not the only challenge that I faced in my journey. I had to face several other obstacles, including my fear of public speaking. As a writer, you would be forgiven for thinking that speaking in public is not an essential skill. However, as a journalist, it is crucial to be able to speak with people, ask questions, and present your stories. During the summer between my junior and senior year, I took an internship at a local television station. It was a life-changing experience for me because it catapulted me out of my comfort zone. The internship gave me the chance to go out on assignments with reporters, and I was thrown into situations where I had to speak with people on camera. I was terrified, but I didn't let my fear hold me back. With time and practice, my fear got replaced with confidence, and I gained the skills and courage to speak with people comfortably. My journey has taught me several important lessons, but perhaps the most important is the power of perseverance. Perseverance is the act of fighting through challenges and never giving up on your goals. It is not about being perfect but being willing to try even when the odds are against you. While I am still not sure where my journey will take me, I know that it will involve writing and journalism. These are my passions, and I am willing to put in the effort to make them a reality. The journey of life is not always easy, but with passion, perseverance and an open mind, one can navigate through the ups and downs. In conclusion, finding one's passion is a journey that requires experiencing life and trying out different things. It's okay to change directions, explore new paths, and step out of your comfort zone, as long as you stay true to yourself. For me, writing and journalism are passions that I discovered through my journey, and I am willing to persevere and make them a reality.

C1,175,"The sounds of my bedroom are unusual. The only thing I can hear is the gentle sound of my crochet hook moving from one loop to the next, with the occasional clanking of loose yarn weaving in-between, creating a pattern made of wool. My fingers feel the rough texture of the yarn as I twist and pull it; every knot and hitch is a reminder of a pattern that is forming. As I sit at my desk, fidgeting with my crochet hook and a bundle of tangled yarn, I reflect on the journey that has led me here. For years, I searched for my passion in music, dance, and other active activities. But it wasn't until my mother gave me a few crochet hooks and a ball of yarn that I found my passion. Creating something with my bare hands and this thread of wool was both fascinating and calming. With every pattern I followed, every knot I made, a sense of fulfilment grew within me that I could only describe as euphoric. Crochet taught me patience and taught me that the journey of self-discovery is just as important as the destination itself.

The winding nature of my journey has been eye-opening, full of detours and obstacles, but with perseverance and persistence, I overcame all my uncertainties. High school was a turning point for me; it was a time when I discovered that helping people was the one thing that really made sense to me. Through volunteering, I learned that passion wasn't just confined to one area of interest. I began to focus on the journey of self-discovery instead of a particular destination. I immersed myself in various extracurricular activities, like working with underprivileged children or volunteering at local nursing homes, and joined various clubs and organizations focused on community service and environmental activism. The sights I witnessed during my time volunteering are something I will never forget; elderly citizens singing songs with a shine of hope and love, underprivileged kids laughing and hugging each other despite their struggles. I saw people who were living in difficult situations smiling despite the hand of fortune they had been dealt with.

H,177,"“Bring the ace of spades up,” my Grandmother said as we started our first game of solitaire after I got home from school. “Now, put the black eight onto the red nine.” We played solitaire often, working together to reorganize the cards most efficiently. While it was meant to be a single-player game, solitaire was the one thing we did together, moving and dealing the cards in a symphony of order: red to black, red to black. Pulling the pattern out of the random array of cards. For hours, we sat at our glossy kitchen table, playing game after game. If there were no more moves to make, I would always sneak a card from below a column without my grandma seeing. She always did. I couldn’t understand- What was the big deal of revealing the cards? We might win one out of ten games played. But if we just ‘helped ourselves,’ as I liked to call it, we could win them all. I didn’t understand her adherence to the “Turn Three” rule. Why not just turn the cards one by one? It was too frustrating to see the cards go by, but turn exactly three and not be able to pick them up! After one game we lost, I asked my grandma, “Why do we play this way? There’s a much better way to play.” In response, she quickly explained her adamancy to the rules, what before had made no sense to me. Her polished fingernails scratched against the cards as she shuffled them and told me. “Solitaire isn’t just a game for one person.” Her deep brown eyes sharply glanced at me, “No.” It wasn’t just a game for one person, but rather for two sides of a person. It was an internal battle, a strengthening of the mind. One playing against oneself. “If one side of you cheats, how would either side get better?” Red lipsticked lips slightly grinned as my grandma saw me trying to understand, but I didn’t agree with this thought at once. The cards rhythmically slapped down onto the table as my grandmother, small yet stoic, effortlessly moved the cards with frail hands. I watched her. I thought about any other way to understand this idea. I desperately wanted to. Trying to think, I couldn’t imagine another instance where this sense of tranquility, bringing the melody of organization out of a cacophony of random cards, came from such intense competition. The slow manipulation of life around her precedent made me think back to my grandma, to what she told me, and made me understand. Two years later, pushing myself harder than I ever had before in a field hockey match, I realized how much I had been cheating myself and my team by not putting this effort in before. Four years later, I was helping my parents clean after dinner when I saw the value in not taking the easy way out. Five years later, I found once again the difficult ease in pottery. Lifting the pot off the wheel, I found satisfaction. Looking back, I hadn’t realized that this notion of self-accountability appears in almost every aspect of my life. Seven columns. Four aces. Fifty-two cards. Laying these down, I’m brought back to playing solitaire with my grandmother. Through time, her inner spirit never crumbled as her body began to deteriorate. Her mind stayed strong and proud. I admired her for that more than she could’ve imagined. Each challenge I face, or will face, in life, I think back to her lesson one inconspicuous afternoon. Never let myself cheat. Always hold myself accountable. Work hard in every competition, especially the ones against myself, as those are the ones that better me the most. I did not understand what my grandmother meant that day. Now, with each day, I do more.",1,1.938571542,2.305006793,2.746406485,2.98304941,2.597159359,5.2,10.0,14.8,22.4,12.0
C0,178,"We all have played Solitaire at some point in our lives. It is that one game that not only challenges but also manages to keep us entertained for hours. It is a game that you play by yourself, and the only objective is to win. As an avid player for the past few years, I have come to realize that Solitaire is more than just a game. It taught me an important life lesson - self-accountability. I first learned how to play Solitaire from my grandfather. To be honest, I was skeptical at first. The game looked too simple, and I wondered how doing something by myself could be entertaining. But with each passing day, as I got better at it, I started enjoying it. I remember that on one particularly rainy day, I spent hours playing Solitaire, trying to beat my best time. That was the day it dawned on me that Solitaire was more than a mere distraction. It challenged me to hold myself accountable for every move I made. The game consists of a deck of cards that must be arranged in a specific order to win. There are no shortcuts, and the only way to win is to play it right. Every move counts in Solitaire, and that is where the game teaches us self-accountability. Every card we move, or every move we make, impacts the outcome. In simpler terms, we reap what we sow. The game is set up in a way that there is nobody to blame for a wrong move but ourselves. This notion of individual responsibility is an essential lesson that every person should learn, especially when young. Solitaire teaches us that every action we take has consequences. We cannot blame anyone, nor can we take credit for anyone else's moves. The game is a personal challenge, and it is also a personal victory. This lesson extends beyond the game and into our lives. The idea that our lives are what we make of them is true. The choices we make shape our destiny, and it is up to us to hold ourselves accountable for these choices. One of the most incredible things about Solitaire is that it isn't easy. The game requires patience, persistence, and a great deal of mental agility. Every game starts with a fresh set of challenges, and these challenges teach us that there are no good or bad hands in life. We must play the hand we are dealt with and make the best of it. Furthermore, we must learn to adapt to ever-changing situations because that is the only way to reach our desired goal. Growing up, I have had to learn this lesson in the most challenging of ways. My parents got divorced when I was in middle school, and it was up to me to grow up faster than most kids my age. I had to learn how to hold myself accountable for not just my actions but my emotions as well. I realized that every decision I made would impact not only my future but also those around me. It was a tough lesson to learn, but Solitaire helped me understand that self-accountability is the only way to gain control over our lives and rise above adverse situations. With Solitaire, I learned that no matter how good I am, there is always a chance of losing. The game has taught me the importance of resilience and the ability to keep trying even when things are not working out. In life, it is courage and tenacity that separate the successful from the average. The willingness to get back up, learn from one's mistakes, and try again is what makes us human. Even in the face of adversity or failure, we must learn to hold ourselves accountable and rise above the challenges if we are to succeed. In conclusion, I can say that Solitaire has taught me more than just a game. It has taught me the importance of self-accountability, a vital lesson in life, and an essential value to any college or university application. Every move we make impacts the objective, and this idea extends beyond the game into our daily lives. Solitaire taught me that everything is possible, as long as we hold ourselves accountable and keep trying.",0,2.380719191,2.510840684,2.616449707,2.821267924,2.567231542,12.0,15.0,17.8,20.0,16.0
C1,179,"Solitaire is a game that is often underrated and overlooked, but its consequences are nothing short of profound. As a kid, when my mom would tuck me into bed, we would end each day with a game of Solitaire. I found this routine somewhat odd, given that Solitaire is meant to be a single-person game, but my mom insisted that playing it together had meaning beyond the game itself. Just like that, Solitaire became a family tradition that has since passed down through generations. As I grew older, I began to understand the value of the game beyond mere entertainment, and the lessons that it continues to teach me. One of the most important lessons I have learned from Solitaire is the importance of strategy. Winning a game of Solitaire requires patience and strategic planning, as well as the ability to understand the impact of every move, no matter how small. As a college student, strategy is just as important in my daily life as it is in this card game. Whether it is planning my course schedule or preparing for job interviews, I have learned to take the time to think rationally, weigh out pros and cons, and determine the best course of action. The game of Solitaire also reminds me to conserve resources and reduce waste, two lessons that are essential in today’s world. In Solitaire, it is not possible to move every card that catches your eye, but rather, one must carefully evaluate each move and use the designated cards thoughtfully. I have brought this concept of resource conservation into my everyday life. It is important to conserve natural resources by turning off lights when not needed, recycling, and using electronics in a more environmentally conscious manner. Solitaire has also taught me the value of perseverance, and the importance of not giving up. There have been countless times when I thought I could not win a game, but forging ahead and not abandoning hope often resulted in making moves that I would not have made otherwise, overcoming the odds in the final stretch. Similarly, in life, challenges can seem overwhelming, yet continuing to push forward, despite setbacks and obstacles, has been key to my growth and success. Like every game of Solitaire, life requires us to take risks at times. There are times to take calculated risks and even to embrace failure. In the game of Solitaire, one cannot win by blindly drawing cards and hoping for the best. Instead, one must take calculated risks, such as moving an Ace in the hopes of revealing the revealed King, carefully managing the risks and rewards. Similarly, in life, we must take calculated risks, such as applying for our dream job, or pursuing higher education, even if we might fall short at times. This willingness to take risks has allowed me to grow and reach beyond what I thought was possible. Finally, Solitaire has also taught me the value of balance. It is essential to find balance in life, whether it is in the way we manage our relationships, time or hobbies. Like Solitaire, where one must maintain a balance between playing strategically and taking calculated risks, life also requires us to strike a balance between our short and long-term goals, juggling college exams, social life, health and many other aspects of life. In conclusion, Solitaire, a game as old as time itself, has taught me lessons that will remain with me for the rest of my life. The game has become a reminder to think strategically, be patient, conserve resources, push forward, embrace risks, and find balance. Solitaire has taught me life lessons that no textbook or classroom could teach me, and I have learned to appreciate that one family tradition of playing it together provides me with a roadmap for life. Solitaire has become more than just a game in my family, it has become a way of life - a reminder that the lessons we learn and the strategies we implement can always guide us.",0,2.725104598,2.974579541,3.2268591,3.375674471,3.128839534,16.0,20.2,24.8,28.8,21.0
C2,180,"Sitting in the living room with my mom, the faint sound of shuffling cards reverberated from the wooden table. The texture of the cards rubbed against each other and the sound of cards clicking together captured the essence of the game of Solitaire. It was a tradition started by my grandmother that continued to transcend generations, a tradition that taught us invaluable lessons beyond a simple game. Solitaire taught me the quintessential importance of strategy, the ability to watch for a pattern and execute a plan. Every game came with a set of different outcomes, yet the plan always stayed the same - success. Just like in life, you must define the outcome and execute a plan to achieve it. Whether it's in school or career, taking time to set out a clear direction will always pay dividends. It has become a virtue that is now ingrained in the way I handle life. The shuffling sound of the cards reminded me of the need to conserve resources and reduce waste. The game of Solitaire is just like life - limited moves to achieve an outcome. You must conserve your moves and think twice before acting thoughtlessly. From preserving natural resources to being mindful of our carbon footprint, Solitaire taught me the consequences of our every action. Perseverance is the most important cog in achieving goals, and the game of Solitaire was a constant reminder of this. Watching my mom take countless attempts to win a single game became a routine, but her willingness to try again made a profound impact on me. Every game had multiple outcomes, but the perseverance to keep trying was the most critical aspect of achieving success. In life, perseverance means continuing to push forward, no matter how many times you have been kicked down. Seeing through self-doubt and overcoming obstacles will always be a part of me, thanks to Solitaire. Cards being flipped, one after the other, gave rise to the notion of taking calculated risks. Starting a new job or moving to a new city can be daunting, but taking the risk is what sets individuals apart. In Solitaire, taking a calculated risk can lead to the game-winning strategy. Similarly, taking a calculated risk in life can lead to success that may have been unachievable otherwise. The lessons provided by Solitaire go beyond strategy, perseverance and risk-taking. It highlights the importance of balance in our lives. Like the pieces on the board, each aspect of our lives needs balance; juggling numerous commitments can be overwhelming, but finding balance between school, social life and other commitments is the key to a sustainable and fulfilling life. I have found that some of my most valuable life lessons have been through childhood games, like Solitaire. It’s the lessons that remain with us, long after the game is over, that make the experience worth cherishing. Solitaire taught me to be strategic, conserve resources, persevere and maintain balance in every aspect of life. The value of these lessons transcends time, and it is essential we take them forward and use them each day. The sound of shuffling cards from the wooden table and the clicking sound of cards moving always brings back memories of playing Solitaire with my mom. I realize now that the roots of something small can grow into something profound, and that small family tradition of playing a game together has shaped my values forever. So, let us all take a moment to be mindful of our actions, think strategically, never give up, take calculated risks, and maintain balance in everything we do. And most importantly, let us take a moment to play a game or two of Solitaire with our loved ones, to remind ourselves of the lessons that never grow old.",0,2.649283857,2.890882914,2.985206778,3.307578036,2.923790742,16.0,18.0,19.0,24.0,18.5
H,181,"No, Dante. Stop, think, and look at the entire board. I was thoroughly confused. I thought I had procured the complete solution to this elaborate chess puzzle. What am I missing? A knight fork, a bishop move? Am I in check? After a quick glance at the left side of the board, I slapped my hand on my head as I suddenly realized what my chess coach was telling me. My queen was sitting unused, positioned all the way on the other side of the board, and I had no idea. If I were to sacrifice my queen, the opposing rook would be forced to capture it, allowing me to finish the game in style with the illustrious “smothered mate.” If you begin to look at the whole chessboard, then these puzzles will become a breeze for you. Ever since that chess lesson, those words have stuck. Indeed, my chess skills improved swiftly as my rating flew over the 1000 Elo threshold in a matter of months. However, those words did not merely pertain to chess. Looking at the whole picture became a foundational skill that I have utilized throughout my life in school and other endeavors. I particularly remember making use of it on the soccer field. Now, I’m no Arnold Schwarzenegger. Weighing in at a monstrous 125 pounds and standing 5 foot 8 inches, my opponents made it a habit to tackle me to the ground. Once again, I found myself face to face with the defender, and before I knew it, I crumbled to the ground, left isolated and dispossessed. Laying dazed on the pitch, my mind flashed back to the chessboard. It occurred to me that soccer, much like chess, relies on the proper position of the many pieces that combine to create a finished strategy. The “whole picture” of soccer is not just how fast or strong one is or how many tackles you put in; that is only one element of the puzzle. The intelligence and creativity needed in a playmaker is also an essential part of a well-rounded soccer team. I realized that my most significant advantage would always be my in-depth understanding of the game of soccer—where to pass the ball, when to make a run, if the ball should be in the air or driven. I picked myself off the ground, and when that same defender came barreling towards me again, I was zoned in, oblivious to the noise around me. I chipped the ball into the open space right behind him, knowing my teammate would run into the space without even looking. From then on, I continued to hone my skills through intense practice to become the best playmaker I could be, working in conjunction with my faster and stronger teammates to become a well-balanced, unified team. Through chess and soccer, I have discovered that every piece in a puzzle has a purpose. This new perspective has enhanced my ability to stop, stand back, and analyze the whole picture in the many dimensions of my life. In my scientific studies, it was not enough to examine just one C. reinhardtii cell, but it was necessary to zoom out the microscope to capture all of the thousand cells to truly understand quorum sensing and its consequences. In my studies of music, it was not enough to listen to the melody of the finale of Beethoven’s 9th symphony, but one must realize that the true beauty of the composition lies in the whole orchestra handing off this simple melody to every instrument. All these facets—music, research, soccer, chess—are not only completed puzzles but also parts of a greater whole: my life. Every aspect of myself matters as much as the other. As high school comes to an end, the pieces on my board are set, and I only have success in mind. Your move.",1,2.077169697,2.792386122,3.00507192,3.256206292,2.889384009,7.2,13.6,21.0,27.2,19.5
C0,182,"As a senior in high school, I have often been told to consider the 'whole picture' when it comes to my future plans. My parents advise me to think about my interests and skills as well as the job market, my guidance counselor emphasizes the importance of finding a college that fits my personality and academic goals, and my teachers encourage me to explore all of my options before making a decision. However, it wasn't until recently that I realized the importance of considering the 'whole picture' in all aspects of my life. Growing up, I was always a competitive athlete. I played soccer year-round and spent most of my free time training or practicing. However, as I entered high school, I began to experience injuries and burnout. My parents, coaches, and even my teammates pushed me to keep going, telling me to think about the short-term benefits of winning games and earning college scholarships. But I soon realized that I was only looking at a small piece of the puzzle. One day, as I was nursing a sprained ankle, I stumbled upon a TED talk by former NFL player, Terry Crews. He spoke about the importance of creating a 'whole picture' of yourself, one that goes beyond your public persona or accomplishments. Crews shared his experience of feeling disconnected from his true self during his years in the NFL, and how it took him time and introspection to realize that there was more to him than just being a football player. His words resonated with me, and I began to question whether I was truly happy with the path I was on. Over the next few months, I began to explore other interests, I joined the drama club, the model United Nations, and the debate team. I discovered a love for public speaking and political science, two fields that I never would have explored if I had only focused on soccer. By considering the 'whole picture' of myself, I realized that there was so much more to my identity than just being an athlete. As I continued to pursue my newfound interests, I noticed that my grades and overall happiness improved. I felt more fulfilled and engaged in my day-to-day life, and I realized that there was a connection between my hobbies and my academic success. By challenging myself in new ways, I became more confident and capable, both in and out of the classroom. Looking back on my journey, I realize that the impact of considering the 'whole picture' extends far beyond my personal growth. It has taught me to approach challenges with an open mind and an understanding that there is always more than one way to solve a problem. It has also allowed me to see beyond the immediate benefits of a decision and consider the long-term impact on myself and those around me. As I look ahead to my college search, I know that considering the 'whole picture' will be an essential part of my decision-making process. I will take into account not only the academic programs and campus culture but also how the school aligns with my values and long-term goals. I will look beyond the rankings and prestige and prioritize finding a community that will support me and allow me to continue growing as a person. In conclusion, the importance of considering the 'whole picture' cannot be overstated. Whether it is in our personal lives or our academic and career pursuits, taking a holistic approach to decision-making allows us to discover new passions, challenge ourselves, and ultimately become the best versions of ourselves. As I continue to explore my interests and plan for my future, I will always keep in mind the lessons I learned on my journey to finding my true self, and I am confident that this mindset will lead me towards a fulfilling and impactful life.",0,2.83676415,2.962956493,3.147949989,3.432453592,3.005582236,17.4,21.0,24.6,26.0,23.0
C1,183,"Throughout my life, I have often heard the phrase, 'look at the whole picture,' but it wasn't until high school that I fully understood its significance. Like many others, I was often consumed by the short-term benefits of a decision, whether it was winning a soccer game or getting a good grade on a test. However, I have come to realize that true success and fulfillment are only achieved when we take a step back and consider the whole puzzle. One instance where this lesson became particularly clear to me was during a chess lesson. My coach pointed out to me that I was missing a crucial piece of the puzzle, my queen, which was positioned all the way on the other side of the board. By sacrificing my queen, I could force my opponent into a devastating checkmate. This humbling moment taught me that by looking beyond the immediate moves in front of me, I could achieve greater success in the game. After this experience, I began to apply this lesson to other areas of my life, including soccer. Despite being smaller and less physically imposing than many of my opponents, I realized that I could still be successful on the field by using my knowledge of the game to outwit my opponents. I became a better playmaker, learning when to pass the ball and where to run, and eventually became an essential part of a well-balanced team. Beyond soccer and chess, I have come to realize that the concept of the 'whole picture' applies to all areas of life. In science, we cannot fully understand a phenomena by examining just one sample or cell. Instead, we must view the larger system, examining all of the pieces that contribute to it. Similarly, in music, we cannot appreciate the full beauty of a symphony by listening to just one instrument. Instead, we must consider how all of the pieces come together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. As I consider my future path, I am constantly reminded of the importance of looking at the whole picture. In my college search, for example, I am not only looking at the academic programs and campus culture but also considering how the school aligns with my personal goals and values. By taking a step back and considering the bigger picture, I hope to find a college community that will support my continued growth and development. Overall, I have come to believe that the key to success and happiness is to view ourselves as part of a larger ecosystem. Just as each piece of a chessboard has a specific role to play, and each instrument in an orchestra contributes to the overall beauty of a symphony, we too have a unique place in the world. By taking the time to understand our role and appreciate the bigger picture, we can achieve greater success and fulfillment in all areas of our lives. As I move forward in my life, I will continue to remind myself to look at the whole picture, to understand how all of the pieces fit together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Whether it is in chess, soccer, science, music, or any other area of life, this mindset has been and will continue to be the key to my success and happiness.",0,2.763225449,2.931565187,3.162439338,3.40811047,3.058527629,17.4,22.8,25.2,30.6,25.0
C2,184,"Throughout my life, hearing the phrase 'look at the whole picture' had always seemed like a trite piece of advice. It wasn't until my high school years that I realized its significance, and its application expanded far beyond what I had imagined. One chess lesson made me understand that true success and fulfillment are only achieved when we take a step back and consider the whole puzzle. During the game, my coach pointed out that I was missing one crucial piece of the puzzle - my queen. It was positioned all the way on the other side of the board. He explained that by sacrificing the queen, I could force my opponent into a devastating checkmate. I hesitated - giving up a queen seemed inappropriate, like giving up on the game. But this humbling moment taught me that by looking beyond the immediate moves in front of me, I could achieve greater success in the game. Slowly, I began to apply this lesson when participating in other areas of my life too- specifically, in running. I was never an athletic person, and running long distances was out of my comfort zone. But instead of focusing on my immediate goals, I shifted my mindset and began viewing my training in the bigger picture. I registered for races, not just one but a series of them, knowing each race would prepare me for the next one. With every accomplishment, like finishing a five-kilometer race, I felt more confident and at peace with my newfound lifestyle. As I applied this mindset to other areas of life, I became aware that its success was echoed throughout various disciplines. The concept of the 'whole picture' applies to all areas of life. In science, we cannot understand a phenomenon by examining just one sample or cell. Instead, we need to consider the bigger picture, examining all the pieces that contribute to it. Much like in the musical world, where the success of an orchestra lies in how its individual players interact, affecting each other's performances. Together, they create a larger composition. As I consider my college applications, I'm reminded of the importance of looking at the whole picture. I want to invest my time in an institution that resonates with my personal goals and principles as much as it does with academic excellence. By taking a step back and factoring in the bigger picture, I hope to find a community that supports individual growth and development, much like how every piece on a chessboard has a specific role to play. Overall, the key to success and happiness is not just about being content with what one's current standings are, but seeking to make a true impact for oneself and others. By understanding our role in a more extensive and interconnected network of things, we should be able to grasp how we fit into the bigger picture. In doing so, our potential grows, and so do the rewards. Looking at myself, I feel both motivated and at ease knowing I am part of this ecosystem. Each person plays a unique role in the world, and understanding this should motivate us to make the most of our lives. When we see a task or activity with the bigger picture in mind, we allow ourselves to grow, reduce our stress levels and provide a better quality of life. As I move forward in my life, I will continue to remind myself to look at the whole picture, to understand how all of the pieces fit together. Whether it is in chess, running, science, music, or any other area of life, this mindset will continue to be the key to my success and happiness. It has made me appreciate the value of looking beyond the immediate goals and understanding their significance in a world where everything fits together.

H,185,"The first lesson I learned as a student pilot is that left and right don’t exist. Maybe driving on a highway or in a parking lot, left and right is precise enough to describe the location and movements of slow-moving bikers, pedestrians, and cars. But at 36,000 feet in the air in a steel tube hurdling almost 200 miles an hour? Left and right just don’t cut it. During one of my first flights in a small Cessna-182, my flight instructor ordered me to scan the horizon for approaching aircrafts. To my right, I caught a glimpse of one: another Cessna with maroon stripes, the sun’s reflection glinting off its windows. Gesturing vaguely to my two o’clock, I informed my flying instructor, “There’s a plane to the right.” “No, to your right. From his position, what direction does he see you?” From his angle, I was to his left. In that moment, I realized that perspective and precision of language is everything. The radio chirped: “Cessna One-Eight-Two Sandra, heading north to John Wayne Airport. Over.” I navigate using my compass’s north, east, south, and west directions because every pilot’s vantage point differs from each other both vertically and horizontally, creating opposite perspectives. My right was that pilot’s left. Through flying, I began to consider all points of view, regardless of my personal perspective. Perhaps it was my ability to scan the horizon to communicate a single story, uniting contrasting outlooks, that drew me to my love for journalism and the diverse melting pot that was my community. To me, journalism modernizes the ancient power of storytelling, filled with imperfect characters and intricate conflicts to which I am the narrator. As editor-in-chief for my school newspaper, The Wildcat’s Tale, I aim to share the uncensored perspective of all students and encourage my editorial groups to talk — and listen — to those with whom they disagree. Starting each newspaper edition with a socratic, round-table discussion, I ask the other journalists to pursue stories that answer the questions: why did this happen and where will it lead? Expanding beyond the perspectives of my classmates, I began writing articles for the Korea Daily, and later, the Los Angeles Times High School Insider. I schedule interviews with city council candidates, young and old voters, and mayors of my town, obtaining quotes and anecdotes to weave into my writing. My interviews with both Democratic and Republican voters have taught me to thoroughly report polarizing-opposite opinions through an unbiased lens. As a journalist, I realized I cannot presume the opinions of the reader, but instead simply provide them with the tools necessary to formulate their own conclusions. However, differences in perspective in my articles are not solely limited to politics. I found that in my suburban community, people love to read about the small-town hospitality of their own friends and neighbors. Quirky traditions, like our Fourth of July carnival clown and local elementary school’s Thanksgiving talent show, are equally as important to me as national headlines are. My favorite stories to publish are the ones taped onto fridges, proudly framed on the mom-and-pop downtown diner, or pinned into the corkboard in my teacher’s classroom. I discovered the size of my story does not matter, but the impact I leave on the reader does. In my time as both a student pilot and journalist, I grew to love these stories, the ones that showed me that living life with blinders, can not only be boring, but dangerous. Whether I was 36,000 feet in the air or on ground level, by flying and writing, I realized that the most interesting stories of life come straight from the people most different from me.",1,2.66844471,3.241842933,3.525140227,3.684235457,3.434775694,15.4,20.8,24.2,28.0,21.5
C0,186,"As I sat in the cramped airplane seat, I couldn't help but feel enthralled by the world outside the window. Below me were rolling mountains, wide open fields, and a sprawling metropolis. It was a view that made me feel both insignificant and powerful. Powerful because I had the privilege of seeing so much of the world in such a short time, and insignificant because the world was so vast that it seemed impossible to explore it all. It was in that moment that I understood the connection between flying and journalism. As a senior in high school, I have always been fascinated by journalism. I enjoy writing and telling stories, but more importantly, I believe in the power of journalism to inform and inspire. Journalism is a way to connect people to the world around them, and it is a way to hold those in power accountable. But what does this have to do with flying? Well, the two are connected in a way that might seem surprising at first. Flying allows us to see the world in a way that is impossible from the ground. It allows us to witness the beauty and diversity of the world, but also the destruction and devastation that exist in many parts of the world. As a journalist, it is my job to write about these things. To tell stories of both the good and the bad in the world. But before I can do that, I need to see them for myself. I need to witness the world from above, to truly understand the scale of the issues we face. Flying is not just a mode of transportation; it is a tool for understanding. This idea first came to me on a family vacation to Europe. As we flew over the Atlantic Ocean, I was struck by the enormity of it all. The ocean seemed to stretch on forever, and the tiny plane flying over it seemed insignificant in comparison. But as we flew closer to the coast of Europe, I saw the cities and towns below. I saw how people lived their daily lives, and I realized that the world was both vast and intimately connected. It was a moment of clarity that only flying could provide. Since that trip, I have been on many more flights, and each time I have been struck by the power of the view from above. Whether it was flying over the Rocky Mountains or seeing the lights of New York City below me, each flight has provided a new perspective on the world. And as I have pursued journalism in high school, I have come to understand the importance of that perspective. The world is a complex place, and it is often difficult to fully understand the issues facing our communities and our world. But by seeing the world from above, we can begin to understand the scope and scale of these issues. We can see how they are connected, and we can begin to write about them in a way that truly captures their impact. For me, flying and journalism are intertwined. They are both tools for understanding and experiencing the world. And as I look towards college and my future career in journalism, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. I am excited to continue exploring the world from above, and to use my experiences to tell stories that matter. But more than anything, I am grateful for the perspective that flying has provided me. It has allowed me to see the world in a way that few people get to experience, and it has given me a unique understanding of the world around me. It has taught me that the world is both vast and interconnected, and that our actions have far-reaching consequences. As I sat in that cramped airplane seat, looking out the window at the world below me, I realized that flying is more than just a way to get from one place to another. It is a way to understand the world, and a way to tell stories that matter.

C1,187,"Flying high above the earth, it's easy to feel small and insignificant. However, as a young pilot, I learned that precision and perspective are everything. You can't just say 'left' or 'right' when flying a plane because the direction changes depending on the pilot's position. By always considering all points of view, regardless of our personal perspective, we can unite our contrasting outlooks, making us better writers, journalists, and ultimately, better people. As a senior in high school, I have a passion for journalism. I love the power of storytelling, connecting people to the world around them, and holding those in power accountable. But, how does flying fit into this passion? Flying affords us the unique opportunity to see the world from above, to witness the vast beauty and diversity, as well as the destruction and devastation. Seeing the world from above, from a different perspective, can help us understand the issues we face better. Flying is not just transportation — it is a tool for understanding the world. Once I realized this connection, I delved into journalism with renewed vigor. As editor-in-chief of my school newspaper, 'The Wildcat’s Tale,' I encourage open and honest discussions where we can hear the voices and take into account the perspectives of every student. I seek out stories that answer the essential questions of “why did this happen and where will it lead?” From the city council candidates to the young and old voters, to the mayors of my town, I schedule interviews and share the uncensored perspectives of all students, which are not limited to politics, but also quirky traditions and small-town hospitality, that are as important to me as national headlines.

Differences in perspective in my articles show that the world is a complex place, and by using perspectives from the air and ground, we can begin to understand the world's issues. For me, flying and journalism are intertwined. As I prepare to attend college, I am excited at the possibility of continuing to explore the world from above and writing about the issues that matter. The world is vast, but it's also intimately connected. The perspective that flying provides is powerful, and it has helped me see and understand the issues both close to home and globally. Through my writing and my experiences, I want to inspire readers to see the world from a different point of view, to appreciate and learn from differences, and ultimately help create a world that is better for everyone. In conclusion, whether flying or writing, perspective matters. It is not just a matter of knowing what direction is left or right, but understanding how each individual perspective fits into the bigger picture. It's important to seek out different perspectives, listen to diverse voices and understand that everyone has their valuable story to tell.

C2,188,"The sound of the engine is thunderous, vibrating through the thin metal walls of the cockpit. I throttle up the engine, and we begin our ascent. The runway painfully fades away as we become airborne, suspended between earth and sky. Looking out over the wing, I feel completely at one with the world. It doesn't matter what's happening down below; up here, we're free. These are the moments that remind me why I love flying. It's not just about the thrill of being in control of a machine that defies gravity, but the ability to see the world from a whole new perspective. Up here, everything seems so small and insignificant, yet so interconnected. It's that interconnectedness that has always fascinated me. As a journalist, it's my job to tell stories that connect people and events, to show how even the smallest local event can have repercussions that reach far beyond our little community. That's the power of perspective, and it's something that flying has taught me to appreciate. When I first started flying, it was as a hobby. I was just a teenager with a dream, spending countless hours studying and practicing until I finally got my license. But as I navigated the skies, I began to see the world in a whole new way. I started to appreciate the beauty and diversity of the earth below, but also the fragility. As a journalist, I have sought out stories about people who are making a difference in their communities, from activists fighting for environmental justice to local heroes who are working tirelessly to help the homeless. These stories are not about tragedy or despair, but about hope and resilience. They are about people making a difference, one small step at a time. That's why I believe that flying and journalism are so intertwined. Both give us a new perspective on the world, helping us to see things that we might otherwise miss. Both require us to be open-minded and curious, to seek out stories that matter and to share them with honesty and integrity. One such story comes to mind. I was flying over a small town when I noticed a group of people gathered in the main square. Curious, I circled down for a closer look. They were protesting against a proposed fracking site, something that could have significant environmental consequences. I landed my plane and spoke to some of the protesters, hearing their concerns and fears about the future. Through writing and sharing their stories, I helped spread awareness of the issue beyond their small community. People who had never even heard of fracking were suddenly talking about it, and the group received nationwide attention. While the fracking site still went ahead, the story showed how speaking out and taking action can make a difference. It's those kinds of stories that motivate me to be a journalist. They remind me that even the smallest voice can make a difference, and that a new perspective can change everything. In conclusion, flying and journalism may seem like two very different passions, but they are both about perspective. Whether you're soaring high above the earth or writing a story about a local hero, it's important to remember that every perspective matters. By combining these two passions, I hope to bring a unique voice to the world, sharing stories that matter and helping to create a more informed, connected, and compassionate society. As I prepare for college, I'm excited to continue exploring the world from above and sharing the stories that matter. From climate change to social justice issues, there are so many stories that need to be told, so many perspectives that need to be heard. With a love of flying and a passion for journalism, I believe that I can make a difference, and I can't wait to see where these passions take me.",0,2.294858625,2.626426571,2.820219989,2.986213901,2.748581074,11.0,15.0,19.0,21.6,17.0
H,189,"Whether I was blowing out candles, writing a letter to santa, or waiting for the clock to turn 11:11, my one wish growing up was not for something, but for someone. I wanted a sibling. I would always look to my friends and think how lucky they were to have brothers and sisters to play with, while I was stuck at home alone with my parents. However, these sentiments soon changed and my life was transformed, when my parents came home with my new sister, Mia. And while Mia was a furry, Lhasa Apso dog, rather than the human baby sister or brother I dreamed of, she helped me accept and even cherish my life as an only child. I came to realize, however, that it would take much longer for me, and much more than a dog, to accept the other ways I felt alone within my group of friends and my community as a whole. Living in a predominantly white town and attending a school with a population of about 75% white students has had a huge impact on the way I view my Filipino self. While my friends ate turkey and cheese sandwiches at lunch, I would secretly pick at the traditional adobo chicken my mom had sent me that day. I stood by as my classmates made jokes stereotyping and generalizing Asians into one category, even though I knew there were vast differences in our cultures. During social studies classes, I noticed that I learned more about the ancestry of my friends, rather than my own. Consequently, I began to accept the notion that my heritage was of less importance and something to be ashamed of. I masked the pungent aromas of the Filipino delicacies my immigrant parents made with pasta and hamburgers when my friends came over, I laughed off incidents when parents or teachers would mistake me for the only other Filipino girl in my grade, and I recognized that learning solely about European and East Asian history in world history classes was the norm. I started to believe that assimilation was the only pathway to acceptance, along with the only way I could feel less alone within my community. It was not until I entered high school that I realized how wrong I was. Although I did not encounter an increase in diversity in terms of ethnicity, I saw an increase in the spectrum of perspectives around me. Through electives, clubs, and activities, the student body I was met with since my freshman year was open-minded, as well as politically and culturally active and engaged, and I immediately joined in. At speech and debate tournaments, I talked with students from across the globe, while at discussions between the High School Democrats Club and Young Conservatives Club at my school, I enjoyed listening and being exposed to different viewpoints. Suddenly, I was no longer willing to feel defeated and instead began to feel confident in displaying my Filipino pride. I introduced my friends to an array of Filipino dishes from lumpia to toron, I asked my social studies teachers questions about the history and current state of the Philippines, and I no longer saw myself and my background as what differentiated me from others and caused my feelings of aloneness, but as something that I should embrace. I changed my narrative from “alone” to “unique,” and I strive to spread the message that being different can and should be the norm to my peers. I would not be who I am without my Filipino background, and although the community I live in is what previously made me feel alone, it is also what gave me the potential to learn, grow, and broadened my appreciation for what made me unique.",1,2.896386515,3.096079314,3.200289396,3.547589242,3.152198669,20.0,26.0,31.0,38.0,27.0
C0,190,"Growing up in America as a Filipino-American was a unique experience. I was constantly caught between two cultures, two identities, and two ways of life. At times, it felt like I was living in a limbo where I couldn't fully identify with either culture. However, as I’ve grown older, I’ve come to embrace my Filipino heritage and recognize the beauty that comes with balancing two identities. As a Filipino-American, I was always surrounded by Filipino culture, whether it was through our family traditions or our community events. Whenever we gathered as a family, we would always cook traditional Filipino dishes, like adobo or pancit, and we would speak Tagalog, our native language. I remember when my grandmother would visit from the Philippines, I would sit with her for hours listening to her tell stories about our family's history, culture, and heritage in the Philippines. But outside of our home, I was constantly faced with a different culture that I wasn’t always familiar with. At school, I was often asked questions about my background as people tried to understand where I came from. I always felt the need to fit in, and sometimes that meant downplaying my Filipino heritage. I was scared of standing out and being different. As I became older, however, I realized that my culture isn’t something to hide or be ashamed of, but something to embrace and celebrate. I began attending Filipino events and festivals in my community, like the Filipino Cultural Festival, where I met other Filipino-Americans like me. I even started taking Tagalog classes so that I could communicate better with my family and friends in the Philippines. It was through these experiences that I learned to embrace my heritage and became proud of my Filipino identity. Unfortunately, many Filipino-Americans still struggle to embrace their culture in America. I often hear stories from my family about how they were once told to “fit in” or not to speak Tagalog in public. These experiences stem from the idea that in America, the dominant culture is the “right” culture, and those who don’t conform are seen as outsiders. But what many don’t realize is that America is a country of diverse cultures and backgrounds. We should celebrate and embrace those differences because it's what makes us unique. By disregarding or downplaying one's culture, we miss out on the richness and diversity of life. Embracing my Filipino heritage has given me a unique perspective that I believe would enrich a college community. My background has taught me the importance of cultural humility and awareness, as well as the value of hard work and perseverance. Growing up, my parents strived to provide me and my siblings with everything they didn't have. My mother, a nurse, worked endless hours to provide for our family, while my father worked as an Uber driver to help us afford our private school education. Their sacrifices have taught me the importance of education and that with hard work, anything is possible. These values have not only shaped me as a person but have also influenced the way I view and contribute to my community. I have become heavily involved in my school’s Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) committee, where I work to promote diversity and cultural awareness within my school. I have also volunteered with local organizations that work towards improving the Filipinx community, such as the Pilipino-American Unity for Progress. In closing, embracing my Filipino heritage has allowed me to appreciate and understand the importance of cultural diversity. I’ve learned that it's okay to be different and to celebrate who you are, even if that means embracing two different cultures. This experience has shaped me into the person I am today, and I’m excited to bring my unique perspective and experiences to college. As a Filipino-American, I can bring a different voice to discussions, one that values humble pride in one’s roots, sees the beauty in diversities and differences, and considers individual experience as crucial to understanding life. Embracing my heritage has brought me closer to my family, my roots, and the countless stories that make up my history.

C2,192,"The sound of sizzling garlic and rice coming from the kitchen, the vibrant colors of the Philippine flag hanging on the wall, and the smell of the familiar scent of cocnut oil all symbolized a big part of my childhood.

However, as I’ve gotten older, I've learned to celebrate my heritage and embrace my identity as a Filipino-American. For as long as I can remember, my Filipino culture and traditions were always present in my household.

Despite being raised in a Filipino household, I was also exposed to American culture outside of the home. However, it wasn't always familiar to me. People couldn't understand my background, and the cultures that were dominant in America sometimes felt foreign to me. To fit in, I sometimes downplayed my Filipino heritage to feel accepted. It wasn't until high school that I realized that being a Filipino-American should be celebrated. I started attending Filipino events and festivals in my community, like the Filipino Cultural Festival, where I met other Filipino-Americans like me. We share a unique experience of living in two cultures and the sense of belonging to two different worlds, defined by different morals and values. Through those events and festivals, I learned about the importance of embracing my culture and feeling proud of my identity. This experience has taught me to appreciate and understand the importance of cultural diversity.

H,193,"Oreos. On the exterior, a firm chocolate crust; however, when opened, a creamy white center awaits. Unbeknownst to me, a social meaning awaited behind an Oreo that left a lingering poor taste in my mouth. From the seductive, powerful attacks within a tango melody to the upbeat, peppy nature of Top 40 hits, I find myself within a new story with each note. Ballroom and pop music, while vastly different styles, have been interconnected since I was a little girl listening to both Hans Zimmer’s ‘Discombobulate and One Direction’s Kiss You. In high school, when I shared my musical taste with my black peers, I received confused stares back. “Faith, that is the whitest thing. You are such an Oreo!” a friend exclaimed. I didn’t recognize the connection between two seemingly different commodities until I later learned that an Oreo means a black person who displays characteristics typically associated with white people, therefore betraying their black roots. I never saw ballroom and pop music belonging to a certain race, but the negatively charged implications behind ‘betraying’ introduced new guilty sensations. Should I embrace my musical interests and face social alienation from those who share my skin tone? Or set aside my so-called white core and conform to the expectations of an African-American woman that have been placed upon me? I didn’t cut music completely out of my life. Being a clarinet player in my band meant being exposed to various musical styles each day. During my freshman year, I decided to challenge myself and perform a solo for the county solo & ensemble festival. Lyrical Composition No. 6 was a piece for which I could play the notes, the rhythms, and everything else on the page. To me, that was all I needed to do, but my band director thought otherwise. “You’re great at playing the right note at the right time. But where is your interpretation? What can you do to add to this piece?” At first glance, all I saw were measures of black ink permanently etched into the sheet – resistant to change. How do I add to a composition that exudes such a definitive nature? Then at second glance, I looked below the measures. Beyond the notes, beyond the rhythms, I noticed white space – unblemished and waiting for me to create my own contribution. Once I stopped and determined what I wanted someone to feel from this composition, I picked up my pencil and wrote in crescendos, decrescendos, breath marks, and other musical markings that I felt needed to be included. I didn’t want to simply regurgitate the black ink, but rather take the audience on a dynamic journey that reaches a climactic precipice. This realization made the distinction between style and stereotype clear. Being categorized as an Oreo was jarring because the documented definition couldn’t simply be erased. Most stereotypes are never fully expunged because they are deeply ingrained in how society views certain races. While I cannot easily change the minds of the many, I can change the mind of my own. I am my own music maker. I will celebrate the intricacies of ballroom music and belt out a One Direction tune as a proud black woman. That is my style. That is my choice of expression. If allowed, stereotypes can snowball until I am completely consumed by my desire to become the black woman society expects. But I refuse to be held down by its grip because I decide my definition of the black experience. My musical interests are not a betrayal that isolates me from my roots, but rather a beautiful addition that enhances my ever-evolving character. Am I an Oreo? Yes, but by my own design. The creamy white center does not represent a betrayal, but rather a blank canvas patiently waiting for my own input. With pencil in hand, I will not hesitate to make my mark.",1,2.024709372,2.507303038,2.91250326,3.22069541,2.717678569,6.0,15.0,19.0,22.0,17.0
C0,194,"Music has always been a significant part of my life. From singing along to nursery rhymes as a toddler, to mastering classical pieces on the piano, and finally to jamming to indie-rock with friends, music has helped me find my place in the world. However, I have constantly been faced with the challenge of stereotypes constantly surrounding different genres of music. The assumptions and prejudices that come with certain musical interests have often made me feel like I cannot fully express myself, and I believe this is a problem that needs to be addressed. Most people instantly associate different music genres with particular stereotypes. For example, many people assume that people who listen to classical music are stuffy, pretentious or even boring. Similarly, people who enjoy hip hop are often stereotyped as being aggressive or violent. These stereotypes can be quite limiting, as people are much more complex than the perceived generalizations surrounding them. I have always found the assumption that classical music listeners are boring particularly annoying. As a pianist, I have heard this stereotype repeatedly. In fact, it took a while for my friends to believe that I actually loved playing classical music because they assumed that only ‘nerds’ played classical music. Once they actually listened to some of the music I played, they realized that it was both beautiful and complex. I remember one friend told me, “I didn’t know classical music could sound like that. It’s not like elevator music at all.” Another common stereotype is that rap or hip hop is only for angry or violent people. As someone who enjoys hip hop myself, this stereotype is particularly problematic. In reality, hip hop can be a medium of expression for people from all walks of life. Sure, there is hip hop that might glorify violence, but there is also hip hop that is about empowerment, love, and social justice. I remember feeling particularly emotional when Kendrick Lamar released the song “Alright” after the shooting of Michael Brown. The song spoke to the pain and anger that many black Americans were feeling at the time, and turned their pain into a message of hope. It showed me the power of music to take on important social issues, and the importance of not limiting a genre to a single stereotype. Despite the prevalence of stereotypes, I have realized that certain genres of music actually have an equalizing power. For example, when I started playing piano duets with a friend who had very different musical taste, I discovered that music was a way to bridge the gap between us. Instead of focusing on our differences, we found a common ground in the music we played together. We were able to appreciate the beauty of each other’s musical preferences, and we even challenged each other to explore new styles. Music has the ability to bring us all closer together if we can move past stereotypes and appreciate each other’s musical preferences. When we approach music with an open mind, we allow ourselves to expand our horizon beyond the confines of a single genre. It is not necessary to like every genre out there, but it is important not to judge people based on their musical preferences. I understand that breaking down stereotypes around different genres of music is not an easy task. The music industry has long played a role in defining genres and positioning them with certain stereotypes. However, I believe that it is important to be educated about the history and evolution of different genres, and to challenge ourselves to look beyond the generalizations. In conclusion, music has the power to connect us all in ways that we might never have imagined. By breaking down the stereotypes that surround different musical genres, we can appreciate each other’s preferences and come together as a community. Music has been an essential part of my life, and it has helped me break down barriers and find my place in the world. I urge others to challenge the stereotypes they might have about different genres of music and embrace the transformative power that this universal language can bring.",0,2.546951678,2.804002662,2.905487459,3.101707048,2.876101928,15.6,18.0,22.0,25.4,19.0
C1,195,"Finding ourselves in the midst of stereotypes can be daunting. Stereotypes can easily take control of our lives and dictate who we ought to be, what we ought to do, and even what we ought to feel. Stereotypes that surround musical preferences are particularly limiting, as people often judge us based on what type of music we listen to. The assumption that people who listen to country music are all racists or that people who listen to R&B and Hip-hop are lazy and violent have been shown to be false, and it is high time that we stop judging people based on their musical interests. Music is more than just a sound; it is an extension of who we are. People are complex, and they can connect with different genres of music for a variety of reasons. For me, music has always been an escape. Whether I am listening to laid-back indie rock or jiving to up-tempo pop songs, I am always transported to a different world. I never want to limit myself to only one genre of music because that would mean that I am limiting the stories that I am exposed to. From heartbreaks to joys, from war to peace, every genre of music has a story to tell. Despite my love for different genres, I have often found myself facing ridicule from others. One time, while driving with a group of friends, I had the aux cord and was playing my favorite playlist which happened to have songs from various music genres. When a country song came on, one of my friends quipped, “Oh no! Not this song. I thought we were friends, but I cannot be friends with someone who listens to country music.” The comment stung, but it was not the first time someone had judged me based on my musical preferences. Society has made us believe that we cannot enjoy different genres of music, and when we do, we are branded as outsiders. It is time to change this narrative, and I found my voice when I challenged my own biases. As a communication studies student, I learned to communicate effectively with others and to always listen intently. I started having conversations with my friends about their musical preferences, and I was shocked to find that some of them liked genres that were not usually associated with them. I think that this was possible because I did not judge them but allowed them to express themselves freely. We cannot let stereotypes limit us; instead, we must embrace our differences, understand each other, and support the music that speaks to us. I am making it my personal mission to explore different genres of music and encourage people to discover their musical selves. Music brings us together, and just like our taste buds, we should appreciate the variety of music that is available to us. Whether we are listening to Jazz, Gospel or techno, our lives and experiences are being shaped and molded by the sounds that fill our ears. In conclusion, it’s time to dismantle the perception that surrounds different genres of music. We must be intentional about our biases and challenge ourselves to be open to different sounds. Let us not limit ourselves to one genre and conclusion, and rather appreciate the diversity of music. We can create a new narrative that focuses on the beauty of music and how it speaks to all of us in different ways. As Maya Angelou once said, “Music was my refuge. I could crawl into space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.” Let music be our refuge as we learn to appreciate the different musical preferences that make each one of us unique.",0,2.499295049,2.684308792,2.852627131,3.01936568,2.734397983,14.8,17.0,22.0,27.0,20.0
C2,196,"The sound of the guitar strums echoed through the room, and I could feel my body swaying back and forth as I listened to my favorite indie rock band. The bass guitar thumped deep in my chest, and I couldn't help but smile in appreciation of the sound. Music has always been more than just a sound to me. It has been a safe haven and a refuge. It has been an escape from the mundane realities of life and a reminder that life is beautiful and worth living. I remember the first time someone mocked me for listening to country music. It was in high school, and I had just discovered Taylor Swift. I was playing her album on my phone, and my classmates overheard it. One of them muttered, 'Country music? Yuck! I didn't take you for a hick.' I felt embarrassed and ashamed. Was it wrong to like country music? Was I really a hick for liking it? It wasn't until later on in life that I realized how ridiculous those stereotypes were. Music is an extension of ourselves, and it doesn't define who we are as individuals. Just because someone likes country music doesn't mean they are a hick, and just because someone likes heavy metal doesn't mean they are aggressive. I've always been fascinated by how music has the ability to evoke emotions in us. The sound of a violin can make us feel sad or melancholic, and the sound of a trumpet can make us feel triumphant and victorious. Music has the power to connect us, to heal us, and to inspire us. It doesn't matter what genre it is; what matters is how it makes us feel. One of the best memories I have is the time I went to a music festival. I had never been to one before, and I was ecstatic to experience it. The moment I stepped onto the festival grounds, I could feel the excitement in the air. There were different sounds coming from every corner, and each one was as beautiful as the last. I walked around, taking everything in, and I knew that this was where I belonged. It was a celebration of life, of music, and of unity. I believe that the power of music can unite people from all walks of life. It doesn't matter where you come from or what language you speak; the sound of the music is universal. I've been lucky enough to travel to different parts of the world, and wherever I go, I always make sure to listen to the local music. It's a beautiful way to immerse yourself in the culture and to understand the people. In conclusion, music is a beautiful thing that has the power to bring people together. It's time to break down the stereotypes that surround different genres of music and to appreciate the beauty in each one. We should celebrate our differences and learn from each other.

H,197,"It was a wet and dreary October evening. I shook off the dirt from my cleats on the concrete with frustration. Click, clack, click. The sound echoed through my head until I finally rested my heavy legs on the wooden bench in front of my locker. Up until that practice, I had done everything just the way I had the year before in the Netherlands, yet I still did not reap the same successes. At home, I relished being on the national under 15 field hockey team, consistently having high grades, and knowing just about everyone. At Deerfield, however, simply doing my best at practice, finishing my homework and socializing did not yield the same results. Looking down, I began to wonder why I had ever moved to Deerfield and traded my field hockey gear for muddy soccer cleats. In search for answers, I decided to tell Deerfield’s field hockey coach about my tough transition. But instead of an answer, Ms. McVaugh offered me to join a girls’ field hockey practice. I felt thrown off by the unusual opportunity at first, yet I quickly relished a warm rush of excitement surging through my veins as I imagined putting on field hockey cleats again. When I set foot on the turf the following day, however, my initial anxiety rejoined my exuberance. I felt more eyes turning towards me with each step I made. “Boys do not play field hockey,” I could hear the girls think. As I trailed behind the girls during the warm-up, the thought of quitting seemed more tempting with each second of silence that passed. But when the whistle blew and the ball was finally in play, I was surprised to see how quickly the gender barrier vanished. Where there was silence and separation at first, I could now see the shared fanaticism through our red faces and hear the emotion in our clamor. At the end of practice, I felt a burning glow of joy overtake my body as I caught my breath on the bench. In that moment, I gradually realized how I should not let obstacles, like gender boundaries in field hockey, hold me back from exploring new opportunities. Realizing the joy I had found in trying the unconventional, I took this experience to the soccer field to take on its new athletic challenges once again. Rather than agonizing over playing time or titles, I simply redirected my focus on the joy and beauty of the sport. Within days, I noticed the same atmosphere of sweat and screams from the turf take hold of the soccer field. Over time, this helped me take in feedback more readily, ask questions about tactics, and try out new skills. With each new improvement I made through this, I slowly began to grasp the value of my new approach to the sport. As a result, I decided to bring the same open, curious, and risk-taking mindset with me to the other opportunities that boarding school holds. In the classroom, I began asking deeper questions to fully comprehend new material. Back in the dorm, I turned the cultural differences between my peers into opportunities to learn from and contribute back to. From truly grasping nucleophile-electrophile reactions in organic chemistry to sharing Dutch ‘stroopwafels’ with my hall, such moments remind me of why I sacrificed my field hockey gear to go to Deerfield; even as my new mindset gradually led to the grades, friendships, and even athletic achievements I sought before, I realized that I value the exploration, growth and joy behind such successes far more. Now, before I put on my cleats, walk into the classroom or enter my dorm, I do not worry about the successes I might fail to reach or the obstacles that might hold me back. Rather, I pour my heart into such opportunities and take their experiences with me.",1,2.637239653,3.004531655,3.12185288,3.262213479,3.065817963,13.8,20.0,22.4,25.2,21.5
C0,198,"It was the summer before my freshman year in high school, and I was eagerly browsing through the sports tryouts to find my niche on a team. I grew up playing every sport imaginable with my brother and his friends, so I was confident in my ability to compete against anyone. But as I looked closer, I realized something alarming: there weren't any sports offered for girls during the fall season. I was shocked. How could this be possible in this day and age? I kept searching, double-checking to make sure I hadn't missed anything. But alas, I was right - the only sports for girls were offered during the winter and spring seasons. I knew right then and there that I had to do something about it. I decided to take matters into my own hands and start a movement to bring girls' sports to the fall season. But I wasn't prepared for the barriers I would have to overcome. I started researching Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in any education program or activity receiving federal funding. I learned that, theoretically, schools were required to provide equal opportunities for girls to participate in sports. But in reality, many schools didn't comply with the law or actively worked against it. Boys' sports often received better funding, more equipment, and better facilities than girls' sports, which perpetuated the belief that boys' sports were more important. I was determined to change the narrative. I started by writing a proposal and presenting it to the school board. I argued that girls deserved the same opportunities as boys to play sports during any season, not just in the winter and spring. I researched the benefits of girls' sports, such as improved self-esteem, physical health, and teamwork skills. The school board seemed receptive at first, but soon, I realized that I was facing an uphill battle. Some members were openly hostile to my proposal, arguing that girls were simply not as interested in sports as boys. Others claimed that girls' sports were unprofitable and therefore not worth the investment. Despite my best efforts, the proposal was ultimately rejected, and I was crushed. But I wasn't one to give up easily. I reached out to other girls in my school and formed a club called 'Girls in Sports' to advocate for equal opportunities for girls to participate in sports. We organized rallies, wrote letters to lawmakers, and educated our peers about Title IX and the importance of girls' sports. We even held a fundraiser to raise money for new equipment. Slowly but surely, our club gained momentum. Girls from all different sports joined, and we became a force to be reckoned with. We started to see a shift in attitude among our peers and the school administration. More girls were signing up for sports, and the school began to invest in girls' sports by buying new equipment and funding improvements to the facilities. Looking back on my experience, I know that I didn't just fight for girls' sports during the fall season. I was fighting against the systemic gender barriers that exist in sports and society as a whole. Girls are often told that they can't be as good as boys in sports, that their interests should lie elsewhere, or that their bodies aren't built for physical activity. But I reject that notion entirely. Girls should be encouraged to play any sport they want, in any season they want, without facing gender discrimination or stereotypes. Girls' sports are just as important as boys' sports, and they have the potential to empower girls in ways that nothing else can. As I look toward my future at Yale or Harvard, I am excited to continue breaking down gender barriers in sports in new and innovative ways. I want to be a role model for young girls everywhere who dream of playing sports but feel like they can't because of their gender. I want to inspire other girls to speak up and fight for what they believe is right, even when faced with opposition. Ultimately, I know that my fight for girls' sports during the fall season wasn't just about sports - it was about justice, equality, and the power of young people to effect change. I am proud of what my friends and I accomplished, and I know that we made a difference. As I enter a new chapter of my life in college, I am excited to see where my passion for social justice and my love for sports will take me.",0,2.418466956,2.754689172,2.945762206,3.288653267,2.873653007,12.2,16.4,20.0,24.0,18.5
C1,199,"As a high school senior, I have learned that the greatest obstacles are often the ones that challenge your beliefs and question your identity. And for me, that obstacle was discovering the harsh reality of gender discrimination in sports. I have experienced the struggle of trying to fit into a new environment. However, my struggle revolved around gender barriers in sports, and I had to overcome this obstacle to pursue my passion for soccer. Just like any other athlete, I have always been competitive and eager to explore new opportunities. But when I moved to the United States, I was taken aback by how different the sports culture was. In my home country, soccer was a sport enjoyed and played by both boys and girls. However, in the United States, there was an unspoken but evident gender divide in certain sports, soccer being among them. At first, I didn't give it much thought. But soon, I realized that girls' soccer was not taken as seriously as boys' soccer. Girls' teams were not given as much recognition, and the quality of the equipment and facilities were inferior. It was a harsh reality to realize that gender discrimination still existed, even in such a developed country like the United States. But I refused to be a follower of this unjust system. I started to research the history of women's soccer in the United States, and I discovered the incredible journey of the United States Women's National Team. The struggles, the fights, and the victories they had to overcome to gain recognition and equal pay, inspired me to take action. I started by talking to my coach, who was very supportive of girls' soccer. Together, we planned a fundraiser to buy new equipment, promising to change the culture of girls' soccer in our school. And to our surprise, it worked. We gathered enough funds to buy new equipment, and the school administration started to take girls' soccer seriously. But the fight was not over. In my senior year, girls' sports was once again threatened because of budget cuts. However, this time, my team and I were ready to fight back. We started a petition on social media, reaching out to our peers and parents. In less than two weeks, we had over 10,000 signatures, causing a social media uproar. Even local news outlets started reporting on our efforts. And once again, our voices were heard. Our team's budget was increased, securing opportunities for more girls to play sports. As I reflect on my four years in high school, I realized that my fight was not just about soccer, but about advocating for gender equality in sports. I have learned that sports are not just about winning or losing but about challenging societal norms and inspiring others to break the mold. In my next chapter of my educational journey, I believe that my experiences will serve as a stepping stone to bring change to society. I want to continue fighting for gender equity in sports, challenging people to see the bigger picture, and realize the tremendous potential that girls' sports have in empowering young women. In conclusion, gender barriers in sports are real and continue to be a problem. But the real power lies in the individual's will to make a change. As the future leaders of tomorrow, it is our responsibility to challenge social norms and fight for a more equitable future. By doing so, we can break down gender barriers in sports and empower young girls everywhere to follow their dreams.",0,2.368697057,2.761875501,2.972535392,3.067761126,2.895935524,12.8,14.6,18.4,22.0,16.0
C2,200,"The sound of cleats tapping against the field, the smell of fresh-cut grass, and the sight of my teammates in motion were what I lived for. The roar of the crowd after my team scored a goal was the ultimate feeling of satisfaction. But behind the exhilaration were the gender barriers in sports that threatened to block my path. It was a hot summer day when I first stepped onto the soccer field in the United States. I could hear the cheering of parents and the whistles of referees mixed in with the sound of soccer balls bouncing off the walls of the indoor facility. As I approached the field, I noticed there were only boys' teams practicing. I looked around for a girls' team, but there was none. I asked my coach where the girls were practicing, and he told me that they didn't have a team. My heart sank. In my home country, girls' soccer was a common sport, and I couldn't imagine a world where girls' soccer wasn't taken seriously. But that was the harsh reality in the United States - gender discrimination still existed, even in sports. As the weeks went by, I trained hard with the boys' team, determined to show that girls can play just as well as boys. But discrimination still lingered. I didn't get as much playing time as my male counterparts, and the quality of equipment was noticeably inferior to what the boys' team had. I knew that I couldn't give up on my dream, even if society tried to tell me that I didn't belong in the field of play. I researched the history of women's soccer in the United States and discovered the struggles of the United States Women's National Team. Women who were once told that they couldn't play professionally fought for their rights, and against all odds, emerged victorious. I found my inspiration and started to take action. My coach saw my passion and dedication and decided to help me start a girls' soccer team. We called a meeting with the girls in our school who were interested in playing, and to our surprise, we had more than enough players to form a team. But starting a team was only the beginning. We didn't have the support of our school administrators, who still viewed girls' soccer as a 'second-class' sport. My teammates and I felt discouraged, but we were determined to fight back. To make our voices heard, we organized a fundraiser to buy new equipment. We reached out to local businesses and parents, asking for support. The response we received was overwhelming. We raised enough funds to buy new gear, and slowly, the school administration started to take girls' soccer seriously. But we were far from done. Years later, there was another issue that threatened girls' sports - budget cuts. Our team was once again at risk of losing funding, and we knew that we had to take action. My teammates and I rallied together, starting a social media campaign and a petition. We asked our peers and parents to sign the petition and support girls' sports, and to our surprise, we had over 10,000 signatures in less than two weeks. Our campaign went viral, and even local news outlets reported on it. The message was clear - girls' sports were important, and our voices mattered. Our team's budget was increased, and more opportunities opened up for girls to play sports. Looking back at my high school years, I realized that my fight was not just about soccer, but about advocating for gender equality in sports. I discovered the power of teamwork and how the support of others could make a difference. But most importantly, I realized that sports have the power to break down gender barriers and empower young women to pursue their dreams. As I move forward to the next chapter of my life, I know that I will continue to fight for gender equity in sports. My experiences have taught me that even when the odds seem against you, the fight for what you believe in is always worth it.

H,201,"– 3 tablespoons butter – 2 eggs, whisked – 2 medium carrots – 1 small white onion – 1/2 cup frozen peas – 3 cloves garlic – salt and pepper – 4 cups cooked and chilled rice – 3-4 green onions – soy sauce (to taste) – 2 teaspoons oyster sauce (optional) – 1/2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil I bet you didn’t read those numbers. I’ll let you in on a secret – I didn’t either. The ingredients above were copied and pasted from the first Google search result for “fried rice recipe.” But, without any disrespect to the recipe’s owner, I can tell you it’s wrong. The only true fried rice recipe is no recipe at all. There are no measurements, no exact instructions, no timer for how long something should sizzle in the pan. There are only smells and feelings and memories. I learned to cook fried rice on the rickety stool covered in Blues Clues stickers, surrounded by the scents of my nainai’s Minnie Mouse apron, my yéyé’s cashmere sweater, or my mama’s Pantene shampoo; in the comfort of our cozy condo and our sweltering Hángzhou apartment; by watching the eggs crack over delicate china bowls, tossed and stirred in woks using slanted wooden spatulas. We used however much leftover rice we had, however many eggs we found appropriate, and a combination of anything and everything or nothing sitting in the fridge. Yet- I’ve always been more of a baker than a cook. I enjoy recipes – I enjoy the process of being exact and finding details, tweaking and leveling and weighing. Other people will have recipes passed down from their great-grandparents; I will have memories, held dear, but no way to pass anything on besides the recreation of childhood moments. From a young age, I found solace in the meticulous baking recipes found in Western cookbooks. This coveting of all things exact doesn’t flow into the rest of my life. My mom will tell you my desk is a mess – I call it “room for creative license.” My mom will tell you my closet is also a mess – I call it “fashionably curious.” My mom will tell you my life is sometimes, you guessed it!, a mess. I call it MAPWIFOWISTBSIDMOTBOML, also known as “my-artistic-phase-where-I’m-figuring-out-who-I’m-supposed-to-be-so-I-dumped-myself-out-to-be-organized-much-later.” That’s a mouthful, so I shorten it, obviously. On the flip side, I like measuring the liquid in my graduated cylinder from the exact bottom of the meniscus. If your text message has a typo in it, I feel the nagging urge to annoyingly correct you. If the origami swan I folded has an uneven tail, I will take it apart and start over. (This was certainly detrimental to my life during my middle school’s mission to fold 3,000 paper swans.) But I understand the beauty of spontaneity and organic creation. There’s something special in realizing that no two recreations of my grandpa’s fried rice will ever be the same, and really, isn’t that what life is? Creation, without recipe? It’s funny. This may contradict everything I’ve written thus far, but the more I bake, the more I realize perhaps baking is spontaneous too. I don’t always need to weigh my flour beforehand in order to get perfect cookies, nor do I really need to add the copious amounts of sugar the recipe calls for. My signature food is brownies, but I challenged myself to use a different recipe every time. You’d be surprised at how different brownies taste when you add an extra egg, and you’d be especially uncertain about my baking skills if you tried my brownies that had wayyy too much baking soda (trial and error…). I’m learning to love improvisation. It’s not mutually exclusive with loving precision, and it’s such an integral part of my culture, I’d be missing out otherwise. Coming to terms with and embracing the unknown is scary and definitely a process, but I assure you: One day, I’ll master my own fried rice.",1,2.323669507,2.5112632,3.015777273,3.195009098,2.807589036,11.0,16.6,20.4,29.4,18.0
C0,202,"As a child, one of my favorite dishes was homemade fried rice. I would always beg my parents to make it for dinner, and the aroma of the cooking rice and sizzling vegetables would fill the house with a sense of comfort and warmth. As I grew older, I learned to make the dish myself, but eventually found that the recipe I had grown accustomed to following didn't satisfy my desire for true creativity and exploration in the kitchen. I wanted to create my own unique version of fried rice, one that didn't rely on a recipe or set of instructions. Thus, began my journey in creating the perfect, recipe-free fried rice. The key to creating great fried rice without a recipe is to start with experimentation. I began my journey by testing different rice varieties, ranging from jasmine rice to short-grain brown rice, to determine which absorbed the flavors of the dish best. I found that the brown rice, although a bit more challenging to cook, gave a nutty flavor and a firmer texture that complemented the vegetables and spices I planned to include. After cooking the rice, it was time to add a range of vegetables, spices, and sauces. I decided to add the traditional diced carrots, onions, and peas, but also experimented with more unconventional vegetables like zucchini, bell pepper, and kale. I also found that the combination of soy sauce, sesame oil, and sriracha sauce gave the dish a perfect blend of salty and spicy flavors. My recipe-free fried rice quickly became a staple in my diet, a dish I would make for friends and family when they came over for dinner. However, this dish became more than just a meal for me; it became a metaphor for life itself. Like creating the perfect fried rice, life also requires experimentation and creativity. Throughout my high school years, I’ve discovered the importance of exploring new opportunities and challenging myself in all aspects of life. Remembering the lessons from my recipe-free fried rice, I’m constantly trying new things from participating in student-led organizations to traveling abroad to explore new cultures. I’ve found that, similarly to the process of creating the perfect fried rice, it’s important to take risks and try new things to discover what works best for you in life. This mindset has led me to become a passionate leader in my school community, a driven competitor in academic and artistic endeavors, and an advocate for social justice and equity. Additionally, creating the perfect fried rice is a reminder that success doesn't always come from following a set of rules or instructions; sometimes it’s in deviating from the norm that we truly stand out. Too often, we’re taught to strictly follow a predetermined path, whether it be in academics, extracurriculars, or even societal expectations. But those who challenge the norm and embrace their unique qualities often find the most success and fulfillment in life. As I reflect on my journey in discovering the recipe-free fried rice and the metaphor it provided for life, I realize that life is much like a canvas, and each of us has the potential to create our own masterpiece. The beauty of life is in the ability to experiment and try new things, just as I did in my pursuit of the perfect fried rice. While the recipe-free fried rice may seem like a small accomplishment in the grand scheme of life, it has taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of creative exploration and taking risks to create something truly unique. In conclusion, the recipe-free fried rice has not only become a delicious staple in my diet, but it has also provided me with a metaphorical lesson for my approach to life. It has taught me the value of experimentation, creativity, risk-taking, and deviating from the norm to create something truly unique. As I embark on my next journey, applying to prestigious universities like Yale and Harvard, I’ll take the same approach I did in the kitchen, creating a unique representation of who I am, without relying on a set recipe or instructions. I’m excited to see what I can create, both in the kitchen and in the future.",0,2.826874022,3.13530262,3.397801873,3.668508946,3.297721471,16.8,21.8,26.2,31.6,25.0
C1,203,"As an individual who grew up with immigrant parents, I was accustomed to fried rice as a regular dish that was often prepared in our household. It served as a quick solution for busy weeknight dinners or to utilize leftovers. As I grew older, I expressed an interest in learning how to cook the dish myself, but I quickly realized I was not interested in following rigid recipes. Instead, I enjoyed experimenting with different flavors and ingredient combinations to create a unique version of fried rice. To many, cooking without a recipe may seem overwhelming or even unattainable, but for me, it’s liberating. I use this opportunity to be creative and express myself through the food I make. In the case of fried rice, I relish the opportunity to follow my taste buds on this culinary journey. One of the things I like about fried rice is its flexibility. You can use any type of rice you prefer and readily add protein sources or veggies to your ideal liking. One of my preferred dishes for fried rice is a spicy shrimp and vegetable fried rice. Firstly, I prepare the rice separately in a rice cooker. While the rice is cooking, I heat up my wok with a few tablespoons of cooking oil. Once heated, I add diced onions, carrots, and bell peppers for an interplay of colors and textures. After a few minutes, I toss in a handful of raw shrimp and cook them until pink. Next, I move the veggies and shrimp to one side of the wok and crack in a couple of eggs on the other side. I let the eggs cook before gently scrambling them into the rest of the ingredients. This adds a creamy and velvety texture that envelops each grain of rice. Once the eggs are integrated, I add in the cooked rice and continue to mix everything together. That is where I introduce my secret ingredients – a spoonful of sambal chili paste and a dash of soy sauce. The chili paste gives the dish a kick of heat, while the soy sauce adds more flavor and saltiness. I usually estimate the amount of sauce I use and adjust it based on my taste buds. At this point, the entire kitchen fills up with the aroma of the frying rice. It's a beautiful medley of flavors that creates an almost addictive bite of textures and tastes. Lastly, I add in a handful of chopped green onions and give everything one final stir. The satisfaction in preparing fried rice without a recipe goes beyond the delightful flavors. It's also the sense of achievement I experience after successfully creating something unique. I take pride in knowing I didn't need to depend on a recipe, but relied on my intuition and taste buds to create something special. Cooking without recipes may seem like a random act, but to me, it's a form of artwork that equally emphasizes intuition and knowledge. Every time I prepare fried rice, I’m creating something brand new and unexpected. I find it thrilling that I can modify ingredients to produce new flavors and never stick to the same recipe. This way of cooking has clear parallels to my personal life; I’ve become more confident and adaptable in other facets of my life because I embraced taking risks and trusting my instincts. Whether it's experimenting with different extracurricular activities or applying to schools that seem out of reach, having faith in myself has opened up multiple life possibilities. As I depart towards college in the fall, I know cooking will continue to bring me happiness and enthusiasm, regardless of whether it’s for myself or others. I’m aware that having faith in my taste buds will guide me in the future. I may not always have a recipe to follow, but I am aware of something even more imperative- my intuition and sense of adventure. Ultimately, cooking without a recipe gives a sense of accomplishment to the skills and knowledge that accompany intuition and experience. There’s always an opportunity to try out different ingredient combinations and flavors to create something unique. I’ll continue to explore more fried rice dishes and experiment with different ingredients to discover new flavors. Above all, cooking without a recipe illustrates the importance of taking risks and being adaptable- important virtues for a successful life.",0,2.774568045,2.821886372,2.959334258,3.076653418,2.882950112,15.0,17.0,18.8,23.4,17.0
C2,204,"Growing up in my small town in northern Maine, winter seemed to last forever. The frigid air was heavy, and it always felt like a chore to simply leave the warmth of my home. But the one thing that seemed to make the bitter winter months a bit more bearable was the sound of snow crunching beneath my boots. As a child, I would spend hours playing outside in the snow, creating igloos or snowmen with my sister. I can still feel the sting of the cold air on my cheeks and the warmth of my breath as I exhaled deeply. The snowflakes that fell from the gray sky often melted on my tongue, and their distinct taste is still something that resonates with me to this day. The snow transformed our small town into something magical, and everything seemed to stop for a moment. But as I've grown older, the winters have become harsher, the snowstorms more frequent. Shoveling the driveway was now seen as a burden, and the glistening snow that once brought joy was now a sign of more work ahead. It seemed like winter was never-ending, and my desire to stay inside grew increasingly stronger. However, one particular winter, I discovered something that reignited my love for the season. One night, as I was shoveling the driveway, I watched as the snow caught the light of the full moon. Everything around me was transformed into an enchanted forest. The trees were silvery and the snow sparkled like diamonds. It was as if everything was covered with a special coating, creating a world unlike anything I had ever seen before. The following evening, I returned to the same spot, and the sight was just as magical as the night before. It was as if the snow was beckoning me to venture further, towards the woods, to discover what lay beyond. That's when I decided to take a stroll through the woods. As I walked, I was astounded by the tranquil beauty of it all. Pine trees towered over me, and their branches were coated in a thick layer of snow, as if they were wrapped in a blanket. The air was crisp and clean, and everything was so quiet that I could hear my footsteps crunching beneath my boots. As I arrived at my favorite spot near a creek, I noticed the ice glistening on the surface. A small, but frozen, waterfall seemed suspended in time, with icicles clinging to the rocks surrounding it. The sound of the creek burbling beneath the ice filled me with a sense of serenity I had never felt before. The world had slowed down to a peaceful, slow pace and I felt completely calm and untroubled. As I gazed at the beauty of the icicles, I realized something. No matter how harsh the winter could be, there was always something of beauty to be found. From the snowflakes melting on my tongue as a child to the frozen waterfall before me now, the harshness of winter had a certain beauty to it. In life, we often wish away difficult situations or anxious times, wishing for them to be over quickly. We overlook the potential beauty hidden in the tough situations we face before the rewards of the eventual thaw. That winter changed my perspective entirely. It helped me understand that even in the dark and cold times of life, there's always something to admire, something that can warm and lift the heart. Whether it's the sound of snow crunching beneath your feet, the beauty of an icicle hanging from a tree, or the stillness of a frozen waterfall, there's always something to appreciate. As I venture towards Yale or Harvard in the coming fall, I'll try to remember the lessons that the winter taught me. I'll keep my heart open and seek out the beauty in every situation, no matter how harsh or difficult it seems. So for now, as I write this essay from my cozy bed, I can almost taste the snowflakes on my tongue, feel the sting of the cold air on my cheeks, and hear the sound of snow crunching beneath my boots. The winters have transformed from a harsh and intolerable season to a time of beauty and awe, filled with hidden treasures waiting to be discovered.",0,2.647276403,2.816033863,2.946093067,3.165791049,2.853282058,14.0,18.0,20.6,24.8,20.0
H,205,"I could still hear her words, the words my teacher said as she handed me the packet, “This is a challenge. But I think you’re up for it.” I held the math packet in my hand. On the cover, the title ‘Mission Possible!’ screamed at me. I could feel my fingers tingling, and the goosebumps rolling up my arms. I stared at the black italicized letters of the title as I walked home. They seemed to stare back, alluding to the mysteries that lay underneath them. As soon as I got home, I ran to the top bunk where I slept, grabbed a pencil, and signed a mental contract with the packet: “I, Zerubabel, promise to prioritize you, put you above all else in my life, not rest, and not eat until all the problems that lay in your pages are solved.” I was a pretty dramatic 11-year-old. This is but one example of the many challenges I’ve faced throughout my life. My love for challenges and the tenacity with which I approach them was instilled in me through observing my family and through my own experiences. Ten years ago, my family and I packed our belongings, sold everything we had, and flew across the Atlantic to our new home in America. During our first year in Minnesota, we were faced with the omnipresent challenge of money. My sister, rather than having the comfort of her crib, was forced to share a bed with my mom and I. My dad was forced to sleep on a makeshift bed my mom made for him every night, using cushions from a torn and scratchy old sofa. My mom was forced to wake up early and stay up late working, at home, and her minimum wage job. My parents never complained. To them, this was just another stage of life, another challenge to overcome. They worked tirelessly-my mom providing stability by maintaining one job while my dad, the creative one, was always switching between multiple in his pursuit for better pay. With each day, the consequences of their hard work showed; one bed became two, the second bed split into a bunk, and within that little room, each of us had a bed to sleep on. I now reflect on this, and many other challenges my family and I have faced during our ten years in America. I realize that it is through observing how my parents never slowed down that I learned the value of perseverance, through watching my mom’s devotion to a single job that I learned the value of commitment, through my dad’s consistent job switches that I learned the value of ambition, and through observing my sisters willingness to live with less that I learned the value of sacrifice. Through my own experiences, I learned I can apply these values and overcome any challenge that comes my way. My 11-year-old self figured this out after a grueling two months of working on the packet, finishing with all the questions answered. Throughout my time in middle and high school, my value of ambition has led me to take the most challenging courses available at my school. In my community, my value of commitment has allowed me to serve at my church for the past five years. These learned values have molded me into the person I am today and will continue to guide me as I pursue my goals in life. It is because of these values and the way they were instilled in me that I have decided to pursue a career as a surgeon; I know it is through the guidance of these values and the people who first showed them to me that I will be able to achieve this goal.",1,2.421956271,2.705705376,2.948115523,3.268296647,2.881585559,14.0,20.0,22.0,26.0,21.0
C0,206,"As a child, I was an avid reader of adventure novels. Nothing was more exciting to me than following the protagonist on their wild quest to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles. These stories fueled my imagination and made me believe that challenges were merely opportunities for growth and advancement. However, as I grew older and faced challenges of my own, I realized that the true value of challenges lies not in their ability to catapult us to success, but in the values they instill within us. One of the greatest challenges I ever faced was moving to a new country when I was thirteen years old. My parents had decided to leave behind everything we knew in our home country to seek better opportunities in the United States. I was excited at first, thinking that living in a new place with new people was going to be an adventure. But as soon as we landed at JFK airport and started our new life, I quickly realized that challenges were not always fun and exciting. For months I struggled to adapt to this new way of life. I battled homesickness and made embarrassing social faux pas, all while trying to keep up with my schoolwork. The language barrier was also a huge obstacle for me. I had never learned English before, and all of a sudden I was expected to speak it fluently. I remember the feeling of utter helplessness I felt when my teacher asked me a question and I couldn't even understand what she was saying. But as difficult as these challenges were, they taught me invaluable lessons about perseverance, resilience, and the power of hard work. In those early days, I had no choice but to keep pushing forward, even when everything felt overwhelming. I started to make connections with people, to learn the language, and to embrace the differences of my new surroundings. Over time, I discovered that I was capable of more than I ever thought possible. I had developed grit and determination that would serve me well in other areas of my life. In many ways, my experience of moving to a new country was a microcosm of the journey we all take through life. Challenges are inevitable, and it is up to us to decide how we will respond to them. We can either shrink back and let them defeat us, or we can use them to become stronger and more resilient. The latter approach requires us to focus on the values that matter most to us - perseverance, determination, and a commitment to personal growth. This focus on values is what truly sets successful people apart from those who remain stuck in a cycle of defeat. It is not enough to simply face challenges head-on; we must do so with a clear understanding of what we stand for and what we are fighting for. For me, this has meant prioritizing my education and my personal development above all else. I have made a commitment to work hard every day, to challenge myself to grow and learn even when it feels uncomfortable. Of course, this is not always easy. There are still days when I feel discouraged or overwhelmed, when the challenges seem too great to overcome. But in those moments, I remind myself of the values that have propelled me this far. I think about the lessons I learned when I first moved to the United States, and I draw strength from knowing that I have faced difficulties before and come out on the other side. Ultimately, the value of challenges lies not in what they can do for us, but in what they can teach us. It is through our struggles that we learn to cultivate resilience, determination, and a deep appreciation for the values that matter most to us. As I look ahead to my future - to my college years and beyond - I am excited to face new challenges and to continue growing as a person.

C1,207,"Challenges are a way of life, and we learn about them from an early age. As children, we are taught that we should face our fears and tackle our problems. The idea of successfully overcoming a big problem can be thrilling and satisfying. As we grow older, we find that life can be hard, and we are faced with even bigger challenges. Nevertheless, it is through these trials that we strengthen our character and grow into the people we aspire to become. My love for difficulties and my determination to overcome them was cultivated early on in my life. I distinctly remember the day when I was in the 6th grade and my math teacher handed me a packet of problems that she said “were not for beginners.' I was excited at the thought of taking on such a difficult challenge. I viewed it as a mental battle that I wanted to win. I took that packet home and devoted myself to it until every problem had a satisfactory solution. Throughout my life, my belief in solving problems has been reinforced. When my family and I moved to the United States, I was challenged in countless ways. My parents worked hard to make ends meet, and I felt the weight of their financial uncertainty. But it was how my parents faced these challenges that left a lasting impression on me. They showed me that through hard work and determination, we can overcome the most formidable obstacles. Through these experiences, I learned that challenges are not just about solving problems, but also about the values that we hold that help us face those challenges. For me, those values are perseverance, commitment, ambition, and sacrifice. These values are what guided me through my struggles, and what will continue to motivate me in the future. They have become the foundation of my character and the driving force behind my goals. Looking forward, I aspire to become a surgeon. I know that this career path will require me to advocate for my patients, to dialogue with my colleagues, and to strive constantly to improve my skills. To meet these challenges and achieve my ambitions, I know that I will have to rely on the values that guided me thus far. I will need to be perseverant as I work towards my degree, committed to my studies, ambitious in my pursuit, and willing to sacrifice to achieve my goals. In many ways, I view the challenges we face in life as opportunities to grow, much like the math packet that challenged me to become a better problem solver. The skills and values that we develop as we face these difficulties are the same skills and values that we will rely on throughout our lives. It is with this mindset that I approach the future: as a series of challenging, yet rewarding, opportunities to grow into the person I aspire to be. In conclusion, challenges play a significant role in shaping who we are. They can be used to build character and fortitude, to improve our problem-solving skills, and to help us define the values that matter most to us.

H,209,"My eyes widen. “It’s all Greek to me,” I whisper under my breath. Sure enough, The Apology by Plato is in Greek. My eyes dart across the page, looking for a word or phrase to grasp onto. Unable to find a familiar word, I take a deep breath. The Greek letters jumble into incoherent words and I am left to the mercy of an incomplete translation. I shake my head, unsure of what to do next. My eyes drag from one word to another, heavy with defeat. Upon the sixth word, however, they stop. My initial scan of the text left me negligent of a simple word meaning “number.” Passion overwhelms my senses. “Number” becomes the most important word of the clause, providing context to the adjacent words. I turn to the lexicon and search for words that fit into a coherent translation. With the last word, I feel satisfaction and pride. The whirlwind of emotions repeats: Confusion, passion, satisfaction. Before the bell rings, I finish translating 20 lines of The Apology. I was fifteen when I successfully translated The Apology, and soon after, I fell in love with translation. Through translation, I learned the value of perseverance and hard work; it even helped me convey ideas in different mediums such as figure skating. On a bright January morning, cold wind slapped against my face, chastising me for falling again. I stood up and brushed thin sheets of ice off of my knees. A shock of pain went through my body as I lightly touched a new bruise. I contemplated defeat. In the midst of choreographing my next program, I speculated the translation of music into skating. I yearned to convey every pitch and emotion in a visual performance, so I listened to Chopin once again and closed my eyes. Upon hearing the cadenza, I went back on the ice, picked up speed and turned my body. Leaping from the ground, I wrapped my arms around my torso and spun one, two, three times. My body descended and a sharp skid sounded the air. I smiled, waiting in anticipation for the next jump. That day, I translated every note into a jump until my body understood the music. Translation has become my frame for viewing life and now I am using it to translate passion into activism. In July 2018, part of my activism was conservation focused. Recognized as a Discovery Guide Leader, I was chosen to lead a Mugwort removal cleanup at Meadow Lake. The tedious logistical process of scheduling a time, obtaining a permit, and learning the proper removal process made July a strenuous month. Still seeking to translate my plan into action, I persevered with the importance of conservation in mind. Finally, the day came. Twenty pairs of eyes watched me as I pointed out Mugwort along the shore. The hot sun hit my back as I pushed the shovel deeper in the soil. The ground released its hold on the plant and I picked it up by the stem. I walked throughout the shore and helped each person learn the proper removal technique. Together we were able to eliminate 4.2 pounds of Mugwort. I was proud of everyone and myself. I learned the benefits of conservation, translated that knowledge into a productive plan to remove an invasive species, and spread that knowledge by leading my eager group of volunteers. Despite translating The Apology by Plato years ago, the lessons I learned from translation continue to thrive in my actions today. Just as I translated texts from Greek to English, I will convert more songs into programs, and I will change more plans into action. Although there are still many things in the world that are all Greek to me, I strive to learn and translate my knowledge into action that creates change.",1,2.187000095,2.575264407,2.865276296,3.035031566,2.746883078,9.6,13.2,15.8,18.4,15.0
C0,210,"As a child, I was fascinated by languages. Growing up in a multilingual household, I was exposed to various languages and cultures, each with its own unique flavor. I loved listening to the different languages spoken around me, and I was always curious about the meanings behind the words. As I grew older, my love for languages deepened, and I began to explore the art of translation. My first experience with translation was when I was fifteen years old. I had just started learning ancient Greek in school, and my teacher assigned us a passage from The Apology by Plato to translate. At first, I was intimidated by the dense text, filled with unfamiliar words and phrases. But as I began to read and re-read the passage, something clicked. I realized that translation was not just about finding the right words to convey a message, but about understanding the deeper meaning behind the words. As I worked through the passage, I began to see how the words and phrases fit together to create a larger picture. I learned the value of perseverance and hard work, as I struggled to find the right words to convey the meaning of the text. And when I finally found the right words, I felt a sense of satisfaction and pride, knowing that I had captured the essence of the text. From that moment on, I was hooked on translation. I began to explore other languages and texts, searching for the perfect words to convey the beauty and power of each one. And as I delved deeper into the art of translation, I discovered that it was not just a tool for communication, but a way of seeing the world. Translation, I realized, was a frame for life. It allowed me to see the world through multiple lenses, to explore different cultures and perspectives, and to find connections between seemingly disparate ideas. And as I looked at the world through the lens of translation, I began to see the power of language in a new way. Language, I realized, was not just a tool for communication, but a way of shaping our understanding of the world. Each language had its own unique way of expressing ideas, and by exploring different languages, I could expand my own understanding of the world. I began to see the beauty in each language, from the intricate grammar of Latin to the flowing poetry of Arabic. As I continued to explore the world of translation, I began to see how it could be used to create change. In my own life, I used translation to convey ideas in different mediums, such as figure skating. I would listen to music and translate each note into a jump, trying to capture the essence of the music in my performance. Through this process, I learned the value of creativity and perseverance, as I struggled to find the right movements to convey the emotions of the music. But I also saw how translation could be used to create change in the world. In the summer of 2018, I became a Discovery Guide Leader, and was chosen to lead a conservation-focused cleanup at Meadow Lake. The process of scheduling the cleanup, obtaining a permit, and learning the proper removal process was tedious and time-consuming, but I remained focused on the importance of conservation. On the day of the cleanup, I led a group of eager volunteers in removing 4.2 pounds of Mugwort from the shore, and I felt a sense of pride and accomplishment in spreading knowledge about conservation and leading a successful cleanup. Through translation, I learned the value of perseverance, hard work, and creativity.

C1,211,"In a world that often feels divided, translation has been my constant source of unity. Growing up in a multilingual household, I was no stranger to code-switching and code-mixing. Yet, it wasn't until I began translating for my grandmother that I fully realized the power of translation. By simplifying complex medical jargon into layman's terms, I was able to ease her fears and ensure that she received the care she needed. This experience taught me that translation is much more than just bridging the gap between languages; it's about breaking down barriers so that people can connect. Since then, translation has been at the forefront of my academic and personal pursuits. As a high school senior, I have translated for a variety of organizations, from local nonprofits to global humanitarian groups. Each experience, whether it involved translating a legal document or a marketing brochure, has taught me something new about language, culture, and the power of communication. But what I find most fascinating about translation is its potential as a vehicle for change. Time and time again, I have seen how translation can bring awareness to a particular issue, mobilize communities, and effect real-world change. Here are just a few examples: - Translating for Political Causes: Whether it's translating for a political campaign or a non-profit organization, translation can be a powerful tool for advocating for change. By making content available in multiple languages, organizations can reach a wider audience and inspire action. - Translating for Social Justice: Through my work with local nonprofits, I have had the privilege of translating for a variety of social justice causes, from immigration reform to criminal justice reform. In each case, translation has played a pivotal role in making information accessible to marginalized communities, empowering them to take action and effect positive change. - Translating for Health Access: Translation has the power to save lives, especially in the realm of healthcare. By providing patients with translated materials, medical professionals can ensure that they understand their diagnoses, medication instructions, and treatment options.

C2,212,"As I sit down to write, my fingers tapping against the cool, smooth surface of my laptop, my mind drifts back to the summer when I translated The Apology by Plato. The memory is still vivid in my mind, as if it happened yesterday - the scent of freshly mowed grass wafting through the air, the sound of the cicadas singing in the trees. It was a sweltering afternoon, and I had been sitting in the same spot for hours, poring over the Greek text and the accompanying English translation. To an outsider, the process might have seemed tedious or even monotonous. But to me, it was a thrilling exercise in mental agility and artistic expression. With each turn of phrase, each subtle shift in tone and diction, I felt myself growing more and more immersed in the text. I marveled at the way in which Plato was able to convey complex philosophical concepts through the artistry of language, and I felt a deep sense of admiration for the translators who had worked to make this text accessible to a wider audience. As I reflect on that experience now, I realize that it was not just an exercise in language or translation. It was a lesson in empathy, in the power of words to connect us to one another across vast distances of time and space. It was an invitation to explore the nuances of another culture, to appreciate the complexity and beauty of a literary tradition that was not my own. This lesson has stayed with me, informing my worldview and my approach to education and life more broadly. Whether I am working on a piano piece or facilitating communication between individuals from different linguistic and cultural backgrounds, I am guided by a commitment to empathy and connection. This commitment is especially relevant today, as we navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected world. The ability to engage with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives is more important than ever, as we seek to understand and address the pressing social, political, and economic issues of our time. For me, translation represents an opportunity to bridge these divides, to find common ground with those who may seem vastly different from ourselves. Through translation, we can learn to appreciate the nuances of language and culture, to cultivate empathy and understanding, and to build lasting connections that can withstand the challenges of time and distance. As I look to the future, I am excited by the many ways in which I can continue to explore this philosophy of translation.

H,213,"I’m Stone’s sidekick, friend, and mentor. Stone created me with Legos back in his fifth-grade robotics lab, and I’ve been with him since. Unlike my noisy colleagues in Toy Story, I’m a silent observer and have watched Stone mature over the years. Given my keen eye and experience, I can confidently say that Stone’s life is closely revolved around me–his robot. In eighth grade, we had to wave goodbye to our founding robotics club since Stone moved to Taiwan. There came our first transition: the new robotics club required me to be built with metal instead of Legos, and Stone had never even laid hands on a wrench before! To my relief, he didn’t stagnate; he shadowed veteran members during meetings, asked questions whenever possible, and stayed for long hours after school to hone his power tool skills. By year-end, Stone had amassed enough knowledge and successfully assembled me a sporty all-metal body. Before we could relish our success, Stone’s family moved once again from Taiwan to Texas. Stone started high school and joined the new robotics club, where a new challenge brewed. Armed with his mechanical experience, freshman Stone was confident in his approach to designing robots, making him both assertive and at times “bossy.” In fact, he developed hearing issues—other members’ ideas would enter his right ear and immediately exit through his left ear. However, his colleagues still respected his dedication, and overlooking his shortcomings, elected him as President at the end of tenth grade. Now responsible for the entire club’s future, Stone realized he must regain his ‘hearing’ and change his leadership strategy to successfully lead the teams. Stone grew cognizant of his approach to leadership as he swayed from authoritative to participative. In discussions, he worked hard to shut up and listen. When assembling me, he encouraged others to take the screwdriver. He even sought feedback from his teammates during carpools. These actions instilled a sense of team spirit and collaboration amongst the members, which transformed me into a robot forged with everyone’s ideas. Through their diligence and (mostly) my skillful performance, we advanced past leagues, regionals, and achieved a place amongst the top teams in the State—an unprecedented accomplishment for The Pastabots. Not that there wasn’t drama along the way. As if obeying Murphy’s Law, my body became limp two days before the State Championship. Sighs and headshakes filled the lab as I pitifully failed at tasks that I had performed flawlessly the day before. After examination, Stone diagnosed me with “terminal launcher jam;” if untreated, we would be lucky to place second to-last. Then, the team discussed my treatment—a complete rebuild or just a patch-up? With the clock ticking, Stone chose to patch me up. Wrong decision: after 4 hours of “quick patch-up,” my metal frame still refused to budge. Some members collapsed on the futon and others stared at the clock. Stone gazed at me while holding his wrench, his incisive brown eyes searching for a solution. Suddenly, he announced, “I’m sorry guys. My decision was wrong, but we can’t give up now! Let’s rebuild the launcher.” This resolve reinvigorated the members, and the operation recommenced. Like performing a surgery, overhead lights brightly illuminated me and the surrounding mechanics. With screwdrivers replacing scalpels, and safety goggles in place of surgical headlights, the team succeeded in assembling a new launcher. With it, I scored points with ease. Drowned in everyone’s cheers, Stone came to understand that failure is a part of life but the will to rectify his mistake serves as a motivation to embark on many more ventures in life. Indeed, from the clicking of Legos to the clanking of metal, Stone has laid many stepping stones for the journey ahead. Although it is filled with obstacles, we will face it with optimism.

H,217,"Ever since the first grade, Dmitri Mendeleev has been my hero. When I first saw the periodic table, I was in awe; the colors, the patterns, the symmetric shape—everything mesmerized me. Ever since that moment, the periodic table has defined the way I live. Just as Mendeleev put together a seemingly random assortment of elements to form the now infamous periodic table, I loved putting together the seemingly random jumble of words and numbers in word problems to formulate a solution. Math has always been a channel for my creativity and passion. In fact, it was through math that I first unearthed my love of discovery. I still vividly remember the rush of joy that I felt when I finished struggling through my first word problem and triumphantly waved it around in the air. As I progressed further and further up the insurmountable mountain of math and began to encounter more foreign concepts, it only got more interesting. No longer was I in a world saturated with numbers; instead, letters and symbols began to enter the mix too. My curiosity was insatiable. And then, I picked up my first calculus textbook. While many remember this moment as one of severe anxiety or trepidation, I remember looking at the strange, archaic symbols, bewildered, thinking where did the numbers go? Because this was in third grade, I didn’t fully understand the intricacies behind the mathematical notation. Nonetheless, it was at that point that I decided to pursue mathematics. But, the more I researched, the more questions I had. As I dug deeper into the inviting, yet mysterious abyss of number theory, I saw math morph into shapes and patterns and I came to the realization that math is more than numbers; mathematics represents a field of patterns, representations, models that lay the foundation for the way our universe works. That’s when it dawned on me: I loved math for the same reason I loved the periodic table. The rush of discovery, the love of patterns, the joy of exploration—everything was the same. As I explored my love for math further, I began to realize that the joy that I experienced when discovering something new was not only because of that “Eureka!” moment; rather, it was utilizing the tools that mathematics provided to apply the intangible concepts so prevalent in textbooks to the world that surrounds us. The duality of the periodic table—the cold, hard numbers mixed with the reassuring, steadfast patterns—has manifested itself in every aspect of my life. While the patterns of the periodic table drew me towards mathematics, it was the systematic, ordered way of bringing math into science that pulled me into coding, first making websites with HTML, then writing programs with Java. My passion for programming grew. The world of coding presented itself to me as a way to bring the patterns I loved into the world in a way I could see them. But something was still missing. After years of refining my analytical interests, I still yearned for that element of science that I had grown to love as a first grader. I was still missing that feeling of success after persevering through a difficult word problem or struggling through memorizing the first 100 digits of pi. It was then that I discovered biology. As I explored various research studies that not only furthered scientific understanding but also helped millions around the world, I knew that this was what I wanted to do. Medical research, specifically in cellular biology and genetics, condenses my passion for mathematics, biology, and discovery into one distinct goal.

H,221,"Standing in front of the kitchen counter, my small hands are placed on the cool granite top and my eyes rest on the empty bowl set out in front of me. On one side lies a pack of masa harina and on the other, a pitcher filled with water. Tortillas are considered to be somewhat of a staple food in Guatemala and in Central American cuisines. Whenever my mom asks me to make tortillas, I groan internally; not because I dislike tortillas, but because I simply cannot make them. What should come naturally as a Guatemalan native is foreign to my small hands. My hands are unable to form the perfectly sized circles because they are trying to decide what dominates more—my Guatemalan roots or the American culture I grew up in. Minutes pass and I have done absolutely nothing. Finally, I extend my hesitant arm to pick up the pack of masa harina and proceed to pour it into the bowl. As I pour the masa harina, I cannot help but think about how much it resembles my journey to America. When I moved, I brought my Guatemalan heritage with me into the massive bowl that is the United States. Continuing with the recipe, I gradually add water to the masa harina and knead it until it becomes the desired texture. Assimilating into American culture and the American way of life was no easy feat for me and I struggled at first, but I found ways to manage. Although my parents were not fluent in English, I was able to learn English with the help of Dora the Explorer, Barney, and my surroundings. Little by little, American culture poured into my life, intermingling with my Guatemalan roots. My next step is to grab a small amount of masa in my hands and begin to roll it into as much of a perfectly shaped sphere as I can. Flattening the ball of masa between my hands, I begin to shape it into a tortilla. Similar to how I have a preconceived notion of how I want the tortilla to turn out, I tend to idealize how I want my life to turn out. Regardless of my efforts, I can’t help it if my tortilla tears as I attempt to shape it. Just like the cracks and tears in my tortilla, I face obstacles in life. However, I have learned to not let them bring me down or keep me from continuing to try. For instance, I come from a low socioeconomic background, but I have never let that stop me from pursuing my aspirations. It is not just about the tortilla that I am making right in front of me. It is about me, my life, and what kind of tortilla I will end up being. Will I be a tortilla that looks like every other one? Or will I be a tortilla, uniquely made in the most perfect imperfect shape? Despite my many failed attempts at making tortillas throughout my life, I have discovered the key ingredient to the tortilla recipe, and ultimately the recipe of life: persistence. If trying to make tortillas has taught me anything, it is that: it’s not about the shape of the tortilla, it’s about how the tortilla faces the hot griddle of life.",1,2.543713473,2.871691922,3.023211582,3.33311145,2.947068763,14.4,18.0,21.0,27.8,19.0
C0,222,"As I walked into my abuela's kitchen, I was enveloped in a familiar aroma of freshly made tortillas. The sound of the dough slapping against her palms and the sizzling sound as they hit the hot comal were music to my ears. Although I’m a third-generation Mexican-American, I knew that the food I ate and culture I lived in were unique and unparalleled. Assimilating and understanding the culture that my family and I have come to love has taken time, patience, and a lot of tortillas. Growing up, I was always surrounded by “American” culture. My friends would talk about their favorite football teams or TV shows, but I never found myself fitting in with their conversations. It's not that I didn't understand them, but my passion lay somewhere else. Instead of watching the newest episode of the hottest TV show, I found myself in the kitchen with my abuela, eagerly learning and replicating her techniques for making tortillas. Tortillas have been a fundamental part of my family's culture for generations. My abuela learned how to make them from her mother, who learned from her mother before her. The recipe has been passed down orally, with no written instructions to guide us. Every family celebration and gathering without fail involves tortillas, either part of the meal or served separately with a variety of condiments. They are a symbol of love and unity within our family, and every time I make them from scratch, I feel a deep sense of pride. Despite our love for tortillas, I struggled to reconcile my family's culture with the world outside. In a predominantly white neighborhood and school, being different shaped many of my experiences. My identity felt fragmented, having to present different versions of myself depending on where I was. I changed my name's pronunciation and tried to tone down my food's spiciness to fit in better. But as I grew older, I began to realize the flaw in my thinking. If I wanted to be accepted for who I am, I had to embrace my identity fully, tortillas and all. It wasn't an easy journey. Fitting in with those around me was still a priority, but over time, I learned that assimilation shouldn't come at the expense of losing myself. Every time I made tortillas, I gained a deeper understanding of my heritage and the beauty of my culture. The recipe's steps were about more than measuring ingredients; they were about devotion and hard work, each step building on from the one before it. It was through tortillas that I learned about the importance of perseverance and determination- as every attempt to get the perfect round shape or even thickness was a test. Sometimes the tortillas would be hard and crusty, but I'd try again until I got it right. Beyond the recipe, tortillas were a vision of a past that connected me to my culture's roots. My grandparents often shared stories about their life in Mexico, of simple pleasures, and hardships overcome through resilience. Tortillas represented this sense of unity as a way of bringing family together through shared meals and memories. Cooking them felt like creating something meaningful, something that honored my ancestors and their struggles. When I began to embrace my identity more authentically, I found that my love for tortillas was a source of pride rather than shame. I would pack tortillas for lunch at school, and my friends would ask for one, wanting to know more about my culture. It opened doors to conversation, understanding, and mutual respect. It was a way of bridging the gap between cultures, creating a space for dialogue and celebration. Ultimately, assimilating to my culture was more about understanding and embracing it on my own terms. I'm still learning and discovering new aspects of it, but the journey has been rewarding. Tortillas will always have a special place in my heart, a symbol of love, unity, and pride. They've allowed me to celebrate our differences, connect to my family, and be proud of the unique culture that makes me who I am today. As I gear up to apply to Ivy League universities, I am confident in my journey to self-discovery and the role tortillas played in that. I see myself as a growing student who has taken on a challenge of embracing a cultural identity that is unique and diverse. And while the journey has been arduous, the rewards have been tremendous- as I've learned to celebrate myself and serve as an ambassador of what it means to be a Mexican American. I hope that my experiences will speak to others and serve as a roadmap for those who are embarking on the same journey. Ultimately, it is a story of discovery, adaptation, and growth — but, of course, it is also a story about tortillas.",0,2.756016346,2.895111418,2.997861199,3.116879847,2.936982369,15.0,17.0,21.0,24.0,18.0
C1,223,"As I stand at the threshold of one of the most significant decisions of my life - choosing a college to attend - I reflect on the journey that brought me here. Tortillas hidden away in my mom's pantry have taught me invaluable lessons about perseverance and resilience, which are not only necessary ingredients for tortilla-making but also some of the essential qualities that college life requires. I have spent the last few years exploring and celebrating my heritage, which has profoundly informed my self-discovery and my outlook on life. The winding road to accepting my Mexican heritage was a journey through my taste buds, and tortillas were my passport to understanding my cultural identity fully. Now, I realize that I have always been a tortilla-maker in a metaphorical sense; that is, every aspect of who I am and who I represent is born of persistently cooking up cultural identity and authenticity. Growing up in a predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood was like feeling like an outsider, despite our common Latin heritage. Puerto Rican food and culture were celebrated, but my Mexican heritage was little more than an afterthought. When my mom would take out the bag of masa harina and begin to teach me how to make tortillas, I was confronted with the realization that there was something genuinely remarkable and meaningful about my heritage. Tortillas became less about food and more about understanding my past, present, and future. When I attempted to press the masa and shape it into the perfect circle, I could not help but consider how every time I made them, I was conscientiously embracing my identity. I was challenging the status quo and defying those who said my heritage is less important than others. Moreover, tortillas taught me, above all else, about persistence. Every time I messed up and created a lumpy, misshapen tortilla, I had to start over - a single-minded and steady approach that required unwavering focus and determination. Every time I got it right, it felt like a deeply personal achievement. This sense of achievement came from dedicating myself to the technique and incorporating the knowledge and expertise passed down to me. This unbreakable tenacity and perseverance that tortilla-making has taught me have become the foundation of my personal and academic life. I learned to embrace challenges and never give up on my dreams, no matter how elusive or difficult they may seem. I have the same focus and dedication when researching, preparing for tests, or writing essays. Whether I'm in the kitchen making tortillas or in a classroom writing a research paper, I know that if I keep at it, practice, and consistently refine my technique, I can accomplish anything. As I prepare for the next chapter of my education, I know that my journey is far from over. Choosing the right college is one of the most challenging decisions of my life, but tortillas have taught me that every failure is an opportunity to grow, and all success is predicated on persistence and the ability to learn from mistakes. I am confident that with hard work, determination, and perseverance, I will gain admission to either Yale or Harvard, and with that comes the added bonus of sharing my love for tortillas with a broader audience. In a world where diversity and global perspectives are becoming essential for students, I know that my love of tortillas and Mexican heritage will create a unique and original perspective, which will distinguish me from other applicants. Finally, the tortillas, which were once an afterthought, now lie at the heart of my cultural identity. And, through the long journey of discovering my cultural identity, I have learned the value of perseverance in every aspect of my life. From the chilly mornings when I stumbled into the kitchen to make tortillas with my mom, to the warmth of a perfect tortilla fresh off the comal, and now as I write this essay, tortillas have been a lesson in patience, perseverance, and persistence.

C2,224,"The sun beat down on me as I walked down the dusty streets of my hometown. The sounds of mariachi music floated through the air, mixing with the aromas of street tacos and lumpia. As a Mexican-Filipino American, I was used to the cacophony of different cultures blending together. Growing up, I had never fully understood the complexity of my identity. It wasn't until I got older that I truly appreciated the diversity that had shaped me. And it wasn't until I learned to embrace that diversity that I realized just how powerful it could be. My journey towards accepting my identity began in high school. I had always known that I was different, but I struggled to put my finger on why. As I talked to more people and made more friends outside my bubble, I realized that my upbringing was unique. Not only did I blend two cultures, but those cultures had blended with each other long before I was even born. My Mexican father and Filipino mother both brought their own traditions and languages into our home. We spoke a combination of Spanish, Tagalog, and English. We ate adobo and tamales on the same table. We celebrated Dia de los Muertos and All Saints' Day. But our family's story was also intertwined with those of others. My great-grandfather had come to the United States from the Philippines to work alongside Mexican laborers. His daughter, my grandmother, had married a Mexican man and started a family. My father had grown up in a predominantly Mexican American neighborhood, but the influence from his Filipino neighbors and friends could not be ignored. So when people started asking me where I was from or what I was, I struggled to answer. Was I Filipino? Mexican? American? It wasn't until I made a conscious effort to embrace my cultural fusion that I began to feel at home in my skin. In college, I became more involved in cultural organizations. I started attending events and learning more about the histories and traditions of both cultures. And as I dug deeper into my own family's story, I began to see how the different elements had come together to create something truly beautiful. Like a mosaic made up of individual pieces, my identity was the sum of all its parts. Mexican and Filipino cultures had intertwined to create a unique perspective that was entirely my own. And as I engaged with more people from different backgrounds, I found that my ability to connect with them only grew stronger. It wasn't always easy, of course. There were times when I felt like I didn't quite fit in anywhere. But as I learned to celebrate the different parts of myself, I began to see how they could be used to bridge divides and create a better world. Now, as a young adult, I continue to explore and celebrate my heritage. I want to visit the Philippines and Mexico, to see firsthand the places that have shaped my identity. I want to use my experiences to help others feel comfortable in their own skin, to build bridges between cultures and communities. Because ultimately, my Mexican-Filipino American identity is more than just a label. It's a reflection of the connections and relationships that have shaped me. It's an emblem of the beauty that comes from cultural fusion. And it's a reminder that when we embrace our differences, we have the power to create something truly special.",0,2.448425583,2.606707223,2.852949468,3.066952991,2.756874522,10.0,13.0,16.0,19.4,16.0
H,225,"“These people are just confused,” Emily whispered to me as she stared out the car window at the gay couples walking down the rainbow streets of the Castro. I was utterly offended by her statement, but I replied calmly, “Let people be who they are.” Emily and I grew up in Texas together as inseparable friends. For twelve years that was our beautiful home, and we enjoyed every moment together. Last summer, Emily visited my new home of five years, San Francisco, for the first time. It felt like no time had passed. We still laughed until our faces turned tomato red. We still screamed our favorite Taylor Swift songs as if there was no tomorrow. Nothing could get in between the love we had for each other, even our vehemently opposing opinions. Emily’s visit sparked a period of growth in which I improved respecting values of those with an opposite viewpoint. That challenge especially reflects the stagnant state of the current political climate in the United States. Extreme polarization is preventing collaboration that could resolve any issues. Even in my daily experiences, I notice the extreme dichotomy. My friends in California stereotype my friends in Texas. My friends in Texas stereotype my friends in California. During debates in history class or jokes during lunch, I observe that these toxic assumptions produce an atmosphere of mistrust. I find that abhorrence exhausting, especially considering that I experienced the beauty on both sides beneath the stereotypes. Disagreement between opposing perspectives is healthy in creating a functioning balance. However, when the fine line between argument and hatred blurs, resolution seems impossible. So, I try to listen with an open mind, even when that feels extremely difficult. Sometimes, pure adrenaline rushes through my body, making me want to bang my hands on the table out of complete anger towards an opinion. I have learned, though, that suppressing my emotional side during a time of disagreement and instead responding with calmness gets my point across more effectively. When that irritation begins to overtake my ability to concentrate on another person’s outlook, I always try to draw from my experiences of living both in the South and in the West. People come from different backgrounds. They are surrounded by different cultures and experiences. I don’t necessarily have to find validity in everyone’s viewpoints to at least listen to their reasoning. The more I remain nonjudgmental, the more my own beliefs develop and become nuanced. I have nothing to lose when I listen to my peers. I extract small pieces of their perspectives in order to enhance my own. If I completely disagree with their opinions, I use their counterargument to articulate a more potent version of my position. The value in telling my story is just as important as hearing another. I love group projects in school, where ideas and creativity flow between people. I adore the end of a cross country race when all the girls from different schools hug and laugh with one another. I cherish being on a soccer team, where the bond between my teammates and me is essential for achieving success. Appreciating uniqueness and connecting to different characters augments my own maturity and depth. I want to meet new people. I want to be challenged by new ideas. I want to experience new places. Despite our differences, Emily and I have a healthy relationship in which we are able to learn from one another; the acknowledgement of our individual value allows us to avoid bitterness. I strive to continue improving my ability to be comfortable with disagreement in order to learn more from my peers. I may not always send up agreeing with Emily, or other people I care about, but I should at least try to understand a different perspective. Only then can I create a bridge that connects two different ideas, allowing for a more harmonious world.",1,2.347827157,2.636382622,2.891495101,3.064078801,2.81749,9.0,13.0,17.0,20.0,14.0
C0,226,"As someone who grew up in a divided household, I have always been familiar with the concept of disagreeing with those who hold different viewpoints. My parents are complete opposites in terms of their political beliefs, and their arguments can turn dinner into a shouting match. However, despite their many disagreements, they have always been able to respect each other’s viewpoints. Witnessing this has taught me the importance of being able to see things from different perspectives and appreciate those who hold opposing beliefs. Respecting opposing viewpoints requires humility and an ability to listen. It is easy to get lost in our own ideas and dismiss those who disagree with us as ignorant or misguided. But the truth is, anyone who holds a different opinion from our own has a unique set of experiences and reasons that have led them to that position. By listening carefully to their arguments, we can begin to understand their perspective and why they feel the way they do. For example, I have always been an advocate for human rights and social justice issues. I am passionate about making the world a better place and fighting against inequality. However, I have come to realize that not everyone shares my same views. Some people believe that certain groups should not have the same rights as others, and this has led to clashes with those who hold these views. Instead of immediately dismissing them as “bigots” or “racists,” I have learned to ask questions to try and understand their perspective. It turns out that many of these people come from vastly different backgrounds and have had their own set of experiences that have informed their beliefs. By trying to understand their perspective, I not only learned a great deal about their reasoning but also gained a respect for their right to believe what they do. When we respect opposing viewpoints, it also means that we don’t have to agree with them. In fact, disagreeing with someone’s opinion does not automatically mean that we don’t respect them as individuals. We can acknowledge that another person’s opinion has value even if we don’t agree with it. This can be hard to do, especially when dealing with issues that feel personally important to us. But it is important to remember that respectful disagreement can lead to productive conversations where both sides can learn from each other. One of the most critical issues of our time is the looming threat of climate change. The future of the planet is at stake, and the consequences of inaction will be catastrophic. However, not everyone agrees on the best way to combat this issue. Some people believe that it is a hoax, while others believe that government intervention will do more harm than good. It can be tempting to demonize those who disagree with us on this issue, but that doesn’t solve anything. In fact, it only further entrenches these people in their positions. Instead, we need to acknowledge that everyone has a stake in this problem and work towards finding common ground. By respecting each other’s viewpoints, we can build coalitions of people who may not agree on everything but are willing to work together for the greater good. Respecting opposing viewpoints also means recognizing that just because someone has a different opinion than ours, it doesn’t mean they are our enemy. It is easy to fall into the trap of seeing those who disagree with us as “other” or “wrong.” But this kind of thinking only leads to division and conflict. Instead, we need to remember that we are all a part of the same community and that we share many of the same goals. By focusing on what unites us rather than what divides us, we can create a more productive and inclusive society. Of course, there will always be instances where it is difficult to respect opposing viewpoints. Some opinions are inherently harmful and go against our values as human beings. The line between respecting opposing viewpoints and condoning harmful behavior is a thin one, and it’s essential to understand where that line lies. However, even in these situations, it is essential to remember that respecting someone else’s viewpoint is not the same as giving them a free pass to act in ways that harm others. We can condemn actions without demonizing those who committed them, and by doing so, we can work towards a more just and equitable world. In conclusion, respecting opposing viewpoints is not easy, but it is a crucial skill to learn. It requires an ability to listen, to see things from different perspectives, and to acknowledge that other people’s opinions have value even if we don’t agree with them. It also means recognizing that we are all part of the same community and that we share many of the same goals. By focusing on our commonalities rather than our differences, we can create a more productive and inclusive society where respectful disagreement can lead to progress and change.",0,2.472836526,2.605263983,2.851333934,2.976955845,2.689568168,15.0,19.0,22.0,26.0,21.0
C1,227,"As someone who strives to be an excellent student and engage in meaningful extracurricular activities, I understand how essential it is to respect opposing viewpoints. In my experience in debate club, I have learned how we can respectfully exchange opinions and challenge each other to be better. This experience has taught me that to be a great leader or an essential contributor to society, I must continually develop my skills for respecting others’ perspectives, even if I don't agree with them. Respecting opposing viewpoints starts with an open mind. It's essential to acknowledge that every person has unique experiences and insights that have informed their opinions. It's necessary to consider each of these perspectives carefully and avoid making assumptions. To do this, I focus on active and empathetic listening. I strive to ask open-ended questions and actively engage with differing opinions. When debating a topic, it's not always beneficial to focus on who is winning; instead, it's important to focus on advancing our understanding. In my involvement in the Model United Nations club, I've learned valuable insights into how different people from different regions around the world view global issues. In these debates, I've often found myself speaking out of turn, arguing against participants with a louder voice than mine, or not listening convincingly. Intense dialogue within this club taught me to become more respectful of other viewpoints. It has taught me to study the countries' cultures and strive to understand the root of their opinions better. As a result, I became more effective in my efforts to present my own views because of my greater understanding of what other participants had to say. This approach allowed me in many instances to bridge our intercultural gap and find common solutions to global issues. It's also essential to acknowledge when my own opinions need refining. By taking an introspective approach to my beliefs, I can address blind spots and prejudices I might have developed over time. Acknowledging that there is always an opportunity for growth allows me to develop a more critical eye as I evaluate my own beliefs. Having more thoughtful and honest opinions leads to a more meaningful debate that everyone can benefit from. As I continue to grow my opinions and viewpoints, I become more equipped with knowledge and experience that helps me think critically, engage in meaningful discussions with colleagues, and make well-informed decisions. Respecting opposing viewpoints is fundamental to achieving progress. In today's world, many issues require collaboration and finding common ground. We can foster healthy dialogue that encourages inclusivity, collaboration, and the free exchange of ideas. Differing opinions can challenge us to think more critically and build better arguments. Dialogue between people with opposite opinions always results in a new perspective and learning opportunities. Different ideas are vital to progress because they raise new viewpoints, force us out of our comfort zones, and propel us towards change. In conclusion, respecting opposing viewpoints goes beyond being polite and courteous to others when they hold differing opinions. It goes to the heart of becoming a valuable participant and leader. With empathy, critical thinking, and self-reflection, we can appreciate other perspectives without compromising our own. In the process, we can make better decisions, establish more meaningful relationships, and contribute to a more just and equitable world. It is my hope that I will continue to develop my listening, critical thinking, and self-reflection skills to become a wholehearted participant in a global society that respects and values diversity of opinion.",0,2.588645995,2.762302871,2.914781165,3.058411171,2.827442314,12.0,15.0,21.0,24.0,18.0
C2,228,"As I sit in the bustling debate room, I can hear the echo of passionate voices discussing controversial topics that range from climate change to abortion. The sound of the papers shuffling as participants prepare their speeches feels like a rhythmic symphony that fills the room with a positive energy. I can see the passion and fire in their eyes as they argue their points, hoping to be heard and understood. In the Model United Nations club, I have learned to appreciate the diversity of opinions that different people bring to the table. I have found myself disagreeing with other participants on multiple occasions, but that has not stopped me from actively listening to what they have to say. Instead of being afraid of their contrasting opinions, I have allowed myself to approach the conversation with an open mind and heart. A conversation that was once filled with tension and opposing viewpoints could quickly become productive and enlightening. A significant example of practicing respect for differing opinions and unique exchanges that contribute to peaceful interactions occurred during a debate regarding climate change. The participant sitting opposite me was incredibly passionate about their stance that climate change was a myth created by the media. I felt compelled to challenge their viewpoint and asked politely how they came to that conclusion. The participant then shared their experience growing up in a family with a business tied to the coal industry. At that moment, I realized that their views on climate change were shaped by their experiences that I had never encountered before. This example shows that respecting differing opinions opens the door to understanding opposing opinions. To show you more about the importance of respecting differing opinions and how it can foster progress, I want to share a personal experience. Growing up, I struggled with math problems, and I dreaded asking for help because of the way my peers would react. I used to feel embarrassed for not knowing how to solve a problem and looked at my classmates who seemed to understand it all. With time and guidance from my teachers, I understood the importance of respecting diverse thought processes. This change in perspective taught me to focus less on the discomfort of not knowing and to ask for help when I needed it. I grew to appreciate the unique approaches and techniques that different students used to solve a problem. This newfound respect for other viewpoints created a supportive and productive environment that everyone could benefit from. When we respect differing opinions, we can unlock innovative and creative ways of approaching problems. We should aim to listen empathetically and learn from each other's perspectives to achieve shared goals. By doing this, we also promote diversity and inclusivity, key values in any community that promotes growth and progress. In conclusion, as far as building communication skills and character strength goes, it is critical to respect differing opinions. Open-mindedness, active listening, and introspection are essential attributes that help build mutually respectful environments. I have found that participating in clubs such as the Model United Nations has provided an excellent platform for skill-building and has taught me to become a participant who respects other viewpoints while enhancing my communication skills. It is my hope that if admitted, I will continue to develop these skills to promote and become a valuable asset to the college community.",0,2.777620824,2.883016858,2.995125988,3.080860744,2.95645959,16.2,19.0,22.0,24.0,21.0
H,229,"There I was, hanging from the precipice, muscles trembling, fingers aching, sweat dripping onto my spotter twenty feet below. He could see I was struggling, and shouted words of encouragement, but my head was pounding too loudly to make out the words. During the initial ascent, I felt strong and confident, though the intense scope of the route had begun to loosen my physical grip, as well as my grip on reality. I made it to the final hold, exhausting every drop of energy, unable to fathom lifting my arm again. The wall then became a towering mental blockade. I knew exactly where to put my hand next, yet I still didn’t feel as if I had the physical means of doing so. I screamed and shot my hand up in a final attempt to finish the climb. I was only hanging on by my fingertips and sheer determination, nevertheless I had made it to the top. My belayer celebrated and lowered me down. Weak and exhausted, I could barely unclip myself from the harness; however, mentally I had never felt stronger. It is during these experiences that the world falls away; all that is left is the rock face itself. I become one with the wall, solely captivated by the placements of its holds and the complexity of its challenge. Time ceases to exist. Rock climbing is a second language to me. I grew up scaling the tallest trees I could find, desiring the highest vantage point. Growing up in the uniformly flat state of Florida, I was limited in my upward journey. Luckily, I rekindled my love for climbing in high school, and now cannot imagine life without it. My passion for climbing is fueled by the adrenaline that pumps through my veins. At first, I was an impatient climber who would try and solve the wall before me, making split-second decisions. However, this strategy rapidly tired me out after beginning to climb. Clearly, this method wasn’t going to get the job done; I had to change my mindset. Now, when I approach a wall, I first draw the problem out in my mind, using my hands to examine the holds. Like a game of chess, I lay out an intricate plan of attack. If I am completely perplexed by a wall, I converse with other pro climbers to guide me towards the best route. Every time I interact with climbers better than myself, I learn a new technique and create new bonds. Being part of the rock climbing community has helped me develop my social skills. The best things about climbing is that there is no clear-cut way to climb a wall, and that there is always a new challenge. My climbing partners say that I take the most unorthodox routes when climbing, but ironically they’re the most natural and comfortable paths for me. I get lost in the walls and climb for hours, as time becomes irrelevant. I think of nothing else but reaching the last hold and forget all of my worries. Even when my friends beg to go home from fatigue, I insist on attempting another route. I don’t feel I’ve had a sufficient climbing session until my forearms are pulsing and the skin on my fingertips are raw. Patience, collaboration, and determination are all needed when climbing a wall, like in any field of research. I no longer say I can’t do something, instead approaching challenges with the utmost confidence. If one plan falls short, I reassess and approach the wall from another angle. I am comfortable making decisions, even when I don’t know what the outcome may be. Through this life-changing sport I have strengthened not only my body but also my mind, learning the beauty of problem solving.",1,2.530337409,2.74516011,2.850155111,2.980835756,2.783920902,14.0,16.0,18.6,21.0,17.0
C0,230,"I first stepped foot on a rock climbing wall in a local gym when I was only twelve years old. At the time, I had no idea how deeply rock climbing would one day become intertwined with my life. What started out as a fun pastime quickly evolved into a full-blown passion, and as I grew as a rock climber, I realized that I was also growing as an individual. Rock climbing is much more than just a physical sport; it requires a strong mental fortitude, a sense of focus, and the ability to overcome challenges. Every time I approach a new climb, I feel a mix of excitement and apprehension. What if I fall? What if I can’t figure out the right sequence of moves? But as I begin to climb, my worries fade away, and I am fully present in the moment. Every ounce of attention is focused on the task at hand, and the sense of accomplishment I feel when I reach the top of a climb is unparalleled. But rock climbing has also taught me invaluable lessons that extend far beyond the walls of the gym. For one, it has taught me the importance of perseverance. There are countless times when I have fallen off a climb or failed to complete a particular move, but I’ve learned that it’s not the failure itself that defines me; rather, it’s my reaction to that failure that truly matters. By approaching each setback as an opportunity to learn and grow, I’ve been able to push myself to new heights in both my climbing and my personal life. Rock climbing has also helped me develop a sense of trust in myself and in others. When climbing with a partner, it’s essential that you trust them to keep you safe while belaying, and that they trust you to lead the climb effectively. This trust extends beyond just the physical aspect of climbing and translates to other areas of my life as well. Through my experiences as a rock climber, I’ve learned to trust my instincts and to believe in my abilities. One of the most poignant lessons that rock climbing has taught me is the importance of community. While it may appear to be an individual sport, rock climbing is actually incredibly communal. Climbers share beta on routes, offer encouraging words to struggling climbers, and celebrate each other’s successes. The importance of this community became evident to me when I moved to a new city and felt alone and disconnected. But as soon as I started going to the local climbing gym, I was welcomed with open arms by a group of climbers who quickly became my close friends. The sense of belonging that I found within this tight-knit community has had a profound impact on my life, and I’m so grateful for the connections that I’ve formed through climbing. Furthermore, rock climbing has taught me the beauty of bravery. The climbs you encounter are always forms of chaos. The outcome is never set in stone, and anything can go wrong. Frankly, if you aren’t nervous, you’re not human. Even when you constantly confront your fears, bravery is not an absence of fear, but the decision to overcome it. You can learn a multitude of techniques and strategies to scaling the wall, but at the end of the day, it is your own bravery that will carry you up the mountain. Throughout my years of competing, I have experienced the elation of victory and the bitter disappointment of defeat. Yet even in the face of disappointment, my passion for rock climbing never wavers. Instead, it fuels me to work harder, to be more disciplined, and to become the best climber that I can be. While I cannot predict the future, I know that rock climbing will continue to play a central role in my life. It has taught me so much about myself, about the importance of community, and about the power of perseverance. As I begin to consider my next steps after high school, I know that I want to continue to pursue my passion for rock climbing. Whether that means competing in college or simply climbing for my own personal growth and enjoyment, I know that this sport will always be a part of who I am. In many ways, rock climbing has allowed me to see life as one big climb, full of ups and downs, risks and rewards, and the thrill of reaching new heights.",0,2.575004319,2.847179515,2.979923575,3.152316441,2.921302195,14.2,18.0,20.6,28.0,19.0
C1,231,"As I gazed up at the towering rock wall, I felt a familiar sense of anticipation and excitement. For years, rock climbing had been my passion, a way to push myself physically and mentally and to learn valuable lessons about perseverance, discipline, and the importance of facing challenges head-on. From my very first climb, I had been hooked. The feeling of hanging from the precipice, muscles trembling, fingers aching, sweat dripping onto my spotter below, was like nothing else I had ever experienced. Even when I was tired and sore, I couldn't wait to get back on the wall and try again. As I progressed as a climber, I began to appreciate the many lessons that rock climbing could teach me. Perhaps the most important of these was the importance of perseverance. No matter how skilled a climber is or how confident they may be, success is never guaranteed. Every climb presents a different set of challenges, and setbacks and failures are simply a part of the process. However, by staying focused and committed to my goal, I have learned that success is ultimately a matter of perseverance and determination. When I encounter an obstacle on the wall - whether it's a difficult move, lack of strength or a moment of panic - I take a deep breath, compose myself and try again. And again. And again, until I succeed. In this way, rock climbing has taught me the value of discipline and practice. Improving as a climber requires not only physical strength and skill but also mental focus and discipline. By dedicating myself to regular practice and training, I have been able to make steady progress and achieve goals that once seemed impossible. But perhaps the most profound lesson I have learned from rock climbing is the importance of pushing myself outside of my comfort zone. Just as each climb presents a unique set of challenges, so too does life. By continually pushing myself to attempt more difficult climbs and to live outside of my comfort zone in all aspects of my life, I have learned that there is no limit to what I can achieve. Even when I fail, I have learned that the experience of trying and pushing myself outside my comfort zone is a reward in itself. Beyond the lessons it has taught me, I have also been drawn to rock climbing because of the deep sense of community it provides. Climbing is certainly an individual sport, but it is also one that requires collaboration and support from others. As a result, the climbing community is a welcoming and supportive group of people who are always willing to lend a hand or offer advice. As I have progressed as a climber, I have come to appreciate the value of mentorship and the importance of cultivating relationships with experienced climbers who can offer guidance and support. Moreover, being a part of the rock climbing community has helped me develop my social skills. Climbers come from all walks of life and backgrounds, and by interacting with people outside of my usual social circles, I have learned to communicate more effectively and work collaboratively with others. Ultimately, rock climbing has been a life-changing experience for me in countless ways. It has helped me to cultivate discipline, perseverance, and a willingness to take risks and push myself outside my comfort zone. But perhaps most importantly, it has taught me the value of community and the importance of working collaboratively with others to achieve a common goal. As I prepare to apply to Yale, I feel confident that my experiences with rock climbing will serve me well in college and beyond. I know that I can bring the same focus, discipline, and willingness to take risks to my academic pursuits, and that my experiences with pushing myself outside my comfort zone will help me to thrive in unfamiliar situations. Looking back on my experiences with rock climbing, I am grateful for the many lessons it has taught me and the profound impact it has had on my life. I know that I will continue to climb in the years to come, and that I will carry the lessons I have learned with me wherever life takes me.",0,2.634149122,2.837819461,2.995386174,3.168096694,2.910951854,14.8,19.0,24.0,29.0,22.0
C2,232,"The morning sun peeked over the horizon, casting a warm orange glow on the craggy mountainside that loomed in front of me. The sight of the towering rock faces never failed to send my heart racing with anticipation and excitement. As I set out on my hike, I inhaled the crisp, pine-scented air and felt a surge of energy coursing through my veins. It was another perfect day for rock climbing, my passion since childhood, where I learned the value of perseverance, discipline, and the importance of facing challenges head-on. As I began to gear up, I could feel the hard, cold metal under my fingers, smell the chalk on my hands, and hear the tinkling of the carabiners and climbing gear. Every climb brought a new challenge, a new set of obstacles to overcome. But with every success, every moment of triumph, came renewed confidence and determination that I could tackle any situation life throws at me. Through the years, I've taken every opportunity to push beyond my limits, to stretch the boundaries of what is possible. My climbs have taken me to the highest peaks, through the narrowest crevices, and over the toughest routes. The power of perseverance struck me when I remembered the time I climbed the long-sought-after El Capitan, the pride of Yosemite National Park. It took me and my climbing partner days to complete the climb, our muscles trembling and fingers aching throughout. But it was the sheer determination that kept us from giving up, even when the mountain seemed impossibly difficult. The climb was not without its setbacks, and we faced countless obstacles along the way. There were moments where the climb seemed too daunting, just out of our reach. But our mentor, a seasoned climber who had tackled this peak countless times, urged us always to keep going, to never give up, and that perseverance was the key to achieving our goals. The further we climbed, the more obstacles we encountered, and the more determined we became to overcome them. We pushed ourselves beyond our limits, both physically and mentally. The climb tested every aspect of our skill, but ultimately it was the strength from within that kept us driving forward. After finally reaching the summit of El Capitan, and looking back down the long trail we had trodden, I felt a great sense of achievement. Every inch of the climb had been a battle, but I had emerged victorious. As I reflect on my journey through rock climbing, I realized that the resilience it gave me was a reflection of the natural world. Every climb I've attempted was a symbol not just of my abilities, but of nature's perpetual motion. The grinding rock, the churning winds, and the roaring rapids all bear witness to nature’s natural resilience. Through rock climbing, I’ve come to understand the indomitable strength of nature and myself. In turn, I’ve come to value the collaborative spirit amongst the climbing community. It is a community that thrives on mutual support and fellowship, where strength of courage and character are celebrated. Climbing has taught me the importance of mentorship, and I’ve learned valuable life lessons from the experienced climbers in the community. Beyond its physical and philosophical values, rock climbing has also been instrumental in developing many of my social skills. The camaraderie established among the climbing crew makes communication with the unfamiliar easy. As I venture into the next phase of my life, particularly as I prepare to apply to top-tier institutions like Yale and Harvard, I am grateful for these lessons. I know that I can bring the same focus, determination, and willingness to challenge myself to my academic pursuits. Finally, it would be impossible for me to climb so far, so hard, and so high if it were not that the human spirit may possess the grit that could keep pushing to the top, with every step feeling like accomplishment, towards the sky. Although daring, climbing is not that different from life itself. Every day presents a new obstacle against the blue sky. I learned that every mistake, every failure is an opportunity for growth and progress. Climbing has taught me to savor the journey and to seek out, challenge, and overcome those obstacles to greater heights, and perhaps to one day inspire others to do the same.",0,2.627117615,2.963142691,3.055879344,3.455033493,3.026428581,14.0,18.0,20.0,24.0,19.0
H,233,"“If you had to choose one food to eat for the rest of your life, what would it be?” Having had this question asked of me many a time, I realize that such an inquiry must be considered practically. The correct answer would keep me happily sustained for the rest of my years, whereas the wrong choice could leave me tormented until I wither away from monotony. If I chose macaroni and cheese, per se, I’d be trapped consuming glutinous pasta, tacky milk-fat, yellow dye No.5, and copious amounts of sodium, forever. But if instead, I call upon my contentment understandings and assess my options accordingly, I may arrive at an indefectible conclusion. And after much deliberation, I believe that I have come to such a response: potatoes. These tubers are the perfect sustenance due not only to their nutritional qualities but, most notably, to their remarkable versatility. Potatoes may be prepared in a myriad of dishes. Creamy mashed-potatoes come first to mind, with their fluffy hills of whipped-bliss gracing one’s tongue so delicately. The thought of golden tater-tots follows; deep-fried potatoes cooked perfectly so as to create a slow crunch when chewed. Then are characteristic french-fries—shoestring or steak, skin on or off. Baked-potatoes, latkes, hash-browns, gnocchi—all respectable meals. And one mustn’t forget potato-chips when searching for alight snack. Oh potatoes, how I love you. And when asked what to eat exclusively for the rest of my life, I will enthusiastically respond “potatoes!”, for by picking one, I choose an abundance. To a casual onlooker, this question may appear inconsequential in its hypothetical nature, but as they say; you are what you eat. My inclination towards the varied is not contained to my food habits—it is a recurring theme throughout my life. I regularly switch from my mom’s house to my dad’s. I’ve moved twelve times. I have a fifteen-year-old sister and a two-year-old brother. I’m a dog and a cat person. This variation tends not to leave me with an aversion to commitment, but a disposition towards diversity. I am interested in many things. So one must understand how I have struggled, faced throughout my education with the question, “If you had to choose one subject to study, one occupation to pursue, one thing to do, for the rest of your life, what would it be?” I love to play viola; I get a rush communicating without-words to my quartet members in order to convey a musical message. I am at my happiest reading a good book; their complex stories captivate me and I aspire to write a novel of my own. I want to make laws that improve my country; all people should have a shot at the American dream. I am passionate about protecting the environment; reducing our effect on global-warming is of the utmost importance to me. I want to help those in need; people still don’t have access to clean water and I want to use my privilege to help change that. I strive to become fluent in Spanish; traveling the world is a dream of mine. Recently, I have discovered that I really like to code; I’m sure in the coming years I will explore things I didn’t know I was interested in. I don’t have an answer to what exactly it is I want to do for the rest of my life. I love English and political science, but I have yet to find such an all-encompassing response as potatoes. What I’ve realized though, is that I don’t have to sacrifice all for one. From each of my interests I learn things that contribute to who I am and shape how I see the world. Eventually, I will focus my path. And when I do have an answer, I will go forth with the knowledge I’ve gathered from each of my varied interests; and I will never stop learning.",1,2.303228618,2.614711347,2.864992225,3.120910685,2.744909828,9.0,16.2,19.4,25.2,19.0
C0,234,"As I stood in the bustling farmers market, my eyes were drawn to a pile of bulky, brown potatoes. They looked unremarkable, dirty, and unassuming. Nevertheless, I reached out and picked one up, admiring its unpretentiousness. Little did I know, this humble potato would help me realize why it is the perfect food. Potatoes are undoubtedly versatile. They can be boiled, mashed, scalloped, fried, and roasted in countless forms. You can boil a potato and savor it with a delicate sprinkle of salt; or you can bake it until it is crispy on the outside and stuffed with cheese, bacon bits, and sour cream on the inside. You can add them to stews, soups, or casseroles to make them heartier, or slice them up, skewer them, and pop them on the grill. The possibilities are endless. Potatoes, particularly the simple ones, pair well with a variety of flavors, making them an excellent ingredient to have in the kitchen. Potatoes are also a cost-effective option, making them ideal for anyone on a budget. They are available year-round, and because they are relatively easy to grow, they are always reasonably priced. You can buy a 5-pound bag of potatoes for less than $5, making them a go-to for low-cost meals. Potatoes are also filling, which means you can eat fewer of them and still feel satisfied. They have a high starch content, and when combined with a lean protein or vegetables, they make for a well-balanced and inexpensive meal. Additionally, potatoes are a nutritious food that can provide valuable health benefits. Firstly, they are rich in Vitamin C, which is a potent antioxidant that helps protect against cancer, heart disease, and other chronic illnesses. They are also high in potassium, a mineral that assists in maintaining healthy blood pressure and muscle functioning. Potatoes have fiber, which can promote gut health and aid in digestion. Furthermore, they contain resistant starch, which is a type of fiber that is not easily digested in the small intestine, leading to a lower glycemic response rate after consumption. This means potatoes can help regulate blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Contrary to popular belief, potatoes are not 'empty' calories; they can contribute to overall health and well-being when consumed as part of a balanced diet. However, the potato's appeal goes beyond mere utility or nutrition, as they can also be a conduit for creativity and exploration. Potatoes are one of the few vegetables that can be a straightforward and satisfying meal on their own. However, they are also amenable to more complex interpretations. Potatoes can be baked or fried in various shapes, sizes, and textures. French fries, tater tots, or hash browns are just a few of the exciting possibilities. When it comes to toppings, the sky's the limit. The classic ketchup or mustard always works, but they also pair deliciously with flavors like spicy curry, tangy yogurt, or caramelized onions. Potatoes can become a canvas upon which you can unleash your inner food artist and create a masterpiece that is yours alone. Above all else, potatoes are a food that invites us to reflect on our identity, history, and culture. Potatoes have been around for centuries and have played an essential role in the diets of numerous cultures worldwide. Potatoes had a transformative impact on Ireland's economy and culture, becoming a staple in dishes like colcannon and shepherd's pie that remain beloved today. However, potatoes are not only a symbol of Irish heritage; they can also provide insights into other cultures. For instance, the potato is a ubiquitous ingredient in Peruvian cuisine and was a staple of the Inca Empire. By exploring the origins and significance of potatoes, we can learn more about the people who have cultivated and celebrated them throughout history. In conclusion, the potato is undoubtedly the perfect food. More than just a humble root vegetable, it is an ingredient that is versatile, cost-effective, nutritious, creative, and culturally relevant. Whether you are a foodie or a budget-conscious shopper, a history buff or a nutrition enthusiast, there is something about this food that speaks to everyone. It is a food that can be enjoyed in countless forms, and its significance extends beyond the plate. For me, that dirty potato at the farmer's market represents something more than just a meal—it represents the culmination of all of these attributes that make it the perfect food.",0,2.538250918,2.734647774,2.973826736,3.290041118,2.868460107,12.0,17.0,19.0,23.0,18.0
C1,235,"The question, “If you had to choose one food to eat for the rest of your life, what would it be?” may seem trivial, but it does have practical applications. Choosing a food that can sustain you for a lifetime is imperative, and not to be taken lightly. While many foods may come to mind when answering this question, I believe that avocados are the food I would choose to eat for the rest of my life. The reasons for my choice are manifold. Firstly, avocados are one of the few fruits that are high in healthy fats. Unlike other fats, the monounsaturated fats found in avocado are good for the heart, improving heart health by lowering bad cholesterol levels. One medium-sized avocado has about 23 grams of healthy fats, which can keep you satiated for hours. This makes them the perfect food for someone like me who is always on the go. Secondly, avocados are also an excellent source of fiber, with each fruit containing about 7 grams of fiber. This is great for aiding in digestion and helping to maintain good gut health. Fiber also helps regulate blood sugar levels and aids in weight loss, making avocados an indispensable part of any diet. Thirdly, avocados are incredibly versatile and can be incorporated into almost any meal. Whether you enjoy them raw, spread on toast, in guacamole, on top of salads, as a dip for veggies, or even as a smoothie ingredient, the options for incorporating them into your diet are nearly endless. This means that you'll never grow tired of eating them. Lastly, avocados are also good for your mental health. They contain vitamins and minerals like folate, Vitamin K, Vitamin E, and Vitamin C, which are necessary for maintaining a healthy brain. Additionally, these vitamins and minerals can help fight depression, anxiety, and other mental illnesses. Furthermore, avocados are relatively inexpensive depending on where you live, which means that they are an accessible food for most people. However, choosing one food to eat indefinitely does not only apply to food but to the choices we make in our daily lives, like our career choices. Just like with food, it is essential to make the right choice when it comes to our careers. While some people have known what they wanted to do since they were kids, others, like me, need to explore their options before making a decision. I have always been interested in technology, and I know that's where I want to build my career. However, technology is such a vast field that I could spend a lifetime exploring it and still not know everything there is to know. Just like with the avocado, technology is incredibly versatile and can be applied to many things. Whether it's building apps, software, websites or working in cybersecurity, the possibilities are endless. I believe I can find my niche in technology by working in cybersecurity because it is a field that's challenging, constantly evolving, and has a significant impact on society. Just like with the avocado, I know I will never get bored with this choice, and I'm excited about the prospect of building a career doing something that I'm passionate about. In conclusion, choosing one food to eat for the rest of your life is not an easy task, just like choosing a career. However, I have come to the conclusion that avocados are the perfect food for me. They are nutritious, versatile, and easily incorporated into my diet. With my career choices, I know that I am interested in technology, and specifically cybersecurity, because it is a field that's constantly evolving and exciting. Choosing the right career is essential to live a fulfilling life, just like choosing the right food is critical to our health.",0,2.584886081,2.761494742,2.915364044,3.224334731,2.823171115,14.0,17.4,21.6,25.8,18.0
C2,236,"As I sit in my backyard on a warm summer day, I can hear the sounds of birds chirping and the gentle rustling of leaves in the wind. The sky is a bright blue, and the sun shines down on me, warming my skin. I take a bite of my avocado toast, and the creamy, buttery texture of the avocado makes my taste buds dance. With each bite, I'm reminded of why I chose avocados as the food I'd eat for the rest of my life. Growing up, food was always at the forefront of my family's life. We spent countless hours in the kitchen, experimenting with new ingredients and techniques. It was in those moments that my love for food blossomed, and I began to appreciate the beauty of healthy eating. My love for avocados began in college. One day, feeling particularly homesick, I decided to make myself some guacamole. As I gathered the ingredients from the grocery store, I marveled at the texture of the avocados. Their smooth skin and soft flesh made them stand out from the other produce. It wasn't until I took my first bite of the guacamole that I realized avocados were more than just a pretty fruit. The creamy texture combined with the salty tanginess of the lime and the heat of the jalapeño was like a symphony in my mouth. It was then that I knew I had found my lifelong food. As I matured in my culinary journey, I began to experiment with different ways to prepare avocados. One of my favorites is avocado toast, which has become a staple in many cafes and restaurants around the world. The buttery texture of the mashed avocado on top of a slice of crispy toast is a sensory experience that cannot be replicated by any other food. Avocado toast is not just a meal, it's an art form. From choosing the right bread to toasting it to perfection, to carefully smearing the avocado just right, it's all about the details. Every bite is like a nourishing hug that makes me feel happy and satisfied. As I sit here in my backyard, surrounded by the sights and sounds of nature, I can't help but draw parallels between avocados and life choices. Just like avocados, our lives are full of choices, and picking the right one can make all the difference. Growing up, I always had a fascination with technology. I was constantly tinkering with my gadgets, trying to understand how they worked. It was not until later years of education that I realized a career in cybersecurity was my calling. Just like my experience with avocados, my career path has been full of experimentation and exploration. Cybersecurity was a field of study that not only fascinates me but also has a considerable impact on society. The world is becoming increasingly technologically dependent, and the responsibility of keeping our data safe falls on cybersecurity experts. As I dive deeper into the field of cybersecurity, I am continually amazed at its versatility. The field is vast and ever-evolving, much like technology. With each passing day, there are new threats, new vulnerabilities, and new opportunities to solve complex problems. Much like an avocado, cybersecurity is abundant in potential. Identifying a vulnerability and patching it is often more rewarding than devouring the most delicious avocado toast. The feeling of accomplishment and the impact it can have on people's lives is nothing short of remarkable. When I compare my two passions, I realize that they have many similarities. Both are abundant in potential, and they keep my passion flame burning strong. Whether it's identifying new vulnerabilities or experimenting with new avocado recipes, both bring a unique sense of satisfaction. In conclusion, choosing one food to eat for the rest of your life may seem trivial, but it has helped me understand the importance of making the right decisions in our lives. Avocados are more than just a fruit, they are a symbol of versatility, nourishment, and creative potential. They have shown me that experimentation is key to finding our passions, and to enjoy life to the fullest.",0,2.564204479,2.727678466,2.940930146,3.101656125,2.864387744,12.8,16.0,18.0,21.0,17.0
H,237,"I looked up and flinched slightly. There were at least sixty of them, far more than expected. I had thirty weeks to teach them the basics of public speaking. Gritting my teeth, I split my small group of tutors among the crowd and sat down for an impromptu workshop with the eighth graders. They were inexperienced, monotone, and quiet. In other words, they reminded me of myself… I was born with a speech impediment that weakened my mouth muscles. My speech was garbled and incomprehensible. Understandably, I grew up quiet. I tried my best to blend in and give the impression I was silent by choice. I joined no clubs in primary school, instead preferring isolation. It took six years of tongue twisters and complicated mouth contortions in special education classes for me to produce the forty-four sounds of the English language. Then, high school came. I was sick of how confining my quiet nature had become. For better or for worse, I decided to finally make my voice heard. Scanning the school club packet, I searched for my place. Most activities just didn’t feel right. But then, I sat in on a debate team practice and was instantly hooked. I was captivated by how confidently the debaters spoke and how easily they commanded attention. I knew that this was the path forward. Of course, this was all easier said than done. Whenever it was my turn to debate, I found that I was more of a deer in the headlights than a person enjoying the spotlight. My start was difficult, and I stuttered more than I spoke in those first few weeks. Nonetheless, I began using the same tools as I did when I learned to speak all those years ago: practice and time. I watched the upperclassmen carefully, trying to speak as powerfully as they did. I learned from my opponents and adapted my style through the hundreds of rounds I lost. With discipline, I drilled, repeating a single speech dozens of times until I got it right. Day by day, I began to stand a little taller and talk a little louder both inside and outside of debate. In a few months, my blood no longer froze when I was called on in class. I found I could finally look other people in the eyes when I talked to them without feeling embarrassed. My posture straightened and I stopped fidgeting around strangers. I began to voice my opinions as opposed to keeping my ideas to myself. As my debate rank increased from the triple to single-digits, so too did my standing at school. I began interacting with my teachers more and leading my peers in clubs. In discussions, I put forward my ideas with every bit as much conviction as my classmates. When seniors began to ask me for advice and teachers recruited me to teach underclassmen, I discovered not only that I had been heard, but that others wanted to listen. At heart, I am still reserved (some things never change), but in finding my voice, I found a strength I could only dream of when I stood in silence so many years ago. Standing in front of the crowd of students, it was my hope that by founding this program, I could give them an experience that was as empowering as mine had been for me. As the weeks passed, the students inched past their insecurities and towards finding their voices, just as I had always wanted to do. On the last day of class for that year, I looked up and saw each of the students standing confidently, equipped and ready to speak their minds in whatever they wanted to do. They had come a long way from being the shy and stuttering novices that they were just thirty weeks before—I can’t wait to see how far they can go from here.",1,2.402404374,2.6501175,2.828572102,3.071073736,2.714347341,9.0,13.0,16.0,23.2,15.5
C0,238,"Growing up, I never realized that my stutter and lisp would become hurdles in my life. However, as I progressed through school, I came to understand the impact my speech impediments had on my communication abilities. It was not just a speech impediment, it was a barrier that prevented me from expressing my thoughts and ideas to the world. As I entered high school, I decided to take action and join debate, hoping to hone my communication skills. My first day in debate class was the beginning of a significant transformation in my life. I remember vividly my nerves as I stood in front of classmates trying to deliver my first speech. My words got stuck in my throat, and the silence in the room only made it worse. The sound of laughter made me feel even more embarrassed than I already was, and I stumbled through the rest of my presentation, barely able to muster the courage to finish. After class, I sat down with Ms. Rodriguez, my debate coach, and talked to her about my speech impediments. She listened intently and told me two things that I still hold on to this day: my speech impediments do not define me, and that with practice, I can improve my communication skills. Ms. Rodriguez became my mentor, and I appreciated her guidance as I worked hard to improve my skills. My first step was practicing speaking in front of a mirror. I would often practice alone while looking at myself, trying different techniques to see which worked best for me. I even started recording myself giving speeches and presenting arguments, going back and analyzing them to identify where I could improve. Through this method and intensive practice, I started to see significant improvements. The feedback from my coach helped me understand the points where I could improve, and with time, I grew more confident in my abilities. Joining my high school debate team was one of the best decisions I have made in my life. The experience was challenging but rewarding. During a debate, I would make extensive notes, prepare rebuttals, argue with logic and reason, and back up my claims with evidence, all while managing my stutter and lisp. I had to think fast, remain composed under pressure, and think critically about the issues at hand. All of these skills not only helped me in debate, but in all aspects of my life. Debate exceeded my expectations. I hadn't realized before joining that there was much to learn beyond having an opinion. I learned how to be a good listener, how to engage people in discussion, and how to build my arguments on real-world issues. I learned to respect different opinions, to recognize the value of fact-checking, and to think critically about the problems facing the world. As I gained more experience, I began to take part in public speaking assignments in class. I started to understand what it takes to be an eloquent speaker and communicator, and I implemented all these lessons in my speech. The fear and trepidation I once felt were replaced by confidence and certainty that I could speak with ease. I found it easier to present ideas in a persuasive, organized manner, and to convey meaning with such precision that I was able to communicate well to people from all walks of life. My debates in high school were my finest moments because I was able to use my speech impediments and turn them into strengths using unique ways that created a competitive advantage for me. With every debate, I grew bolder, and it helped me overcome many obstacles in my life that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. Debate may have started as an activity to help me better communicate, but it became something much more. It gave me the confidence to overcome every obstacle that came my way, instilled creativity in me, taught me how to be a great listener, and ultimately, helped me find my voice. As I reflect on my journey to overcome my speech impediments, I know that nothing is impossible. In overcoming my speech impediments, I found a new appreciation for my unique perspective on the world. It made me realize that what I thought was my biggest vulnerability is actually my biggest strength. The hard work and struggles that led me to where I am today prepared me for anything life throws at me in the future. Now, I am confident that I have the tools I need to make a meaningful contribution to society and the world at large. In retrospect, if I hadn't joined the debate, I don't think I would be where I am today. Debate gave me the platform to overcome my most significant challenge, and for that, I will always be grateful. It showed me the power of determination, hard work, and the resilience of the human spirit. I now know that I can accomplish almost anything, and I know without a doubt that whatever the future brings, I'm ready for it.",0,2.676749874,2.809803357,2.938836347,3.196472369,2.885334315,16.2,18.0,19.6,24.0,19.0
C1,239,"As a high school senior, I have faced many challenges, but the one that has impacted me the most is the journey to find my own voice. Growing up, I observed myself struggling to communicate with people, much like the narrator of a story I read during my childhood. The story had always resonated with me because I had struggled with a similar speech impediment. My impediment made communicating with others difficult and negatively impacted my self-esteem. But I refused to let it define me. I understood that the root of my speech impediment was my shyness and self-doubt, which had developed after years of being an introvert. Nonetheless, I knew that finding my voice was crucial to succeed in life. I couldn't afford to be silenced when everyone else was speaking up. I had to find a way to communicate with people and get my message across effectively. During high school, I explored different avenues to tackle my impediment. Even though it was challenging at the beginning, I knew that I wasn't going to give up on myself. I started by joining the debate team, inspired by the previous writer's experience. Here, I learned how to articulate my ideas and opinions more effectively, gaining the confidence to express myself both in and out of debate competitions. However, there was a problem that I encountered when participating in debates; it did not address my issue of public speaking when it was not structured within the context of a round. Therefore, that summer after my sophomore year, I embraced the opportunity to teach public speaking to a group of middle school students. I had to teach them how to be comfortable and confident when speaking in front of their peers. Seeing their progress from the first day to the last day of class was a rewarding experience, and I saw myself in these teens. I wished someone had done the same for me when I was their age, simply giving me the tools to speak effectively to a crowd. Throughout the classes, it was not just the students who learned. I began to understand how impactful teaching had been on my speech clarity as I would end up deconstructing and splitting up the basics of public speaking for them to understand, it helped me to refine my own communication skills. By my junior year, my speech had improved drastically, and I even won a few debates. I started feeling more confident about my communication abilities both at school and in social situations. I had come a long way since the days when people would mock my stuttering and garbled speeches. My voice was becoming clearer, my flow natural, and my confidence unwavering. My words could finally leave my mouth with ease. However, I knew that I wasn't done improving my communication skills. I wanted to challenge myself beyond debates, which is why I joined my school's choir. Becoming a chorister and perfecting harmony with others challenged me to explore more ways to improve my communication in everyday life. The experience taught me the importance of listening and taking cues from other communicators to compliment one another, something that debates couldn't have provided for me. In conclusion, communication is not easy, and I still have much to learn. Nonetheless, through a combination of debating, teaching public speaking to middle schoolers, and singing, I feel more confident than ever before about my communication ability. I have found my voice, and I am ready to use it. My journey to find my voice has helped me find who I am and what I am capable of, and I am grateful for every moment, every lesson, and every opportunity that has been presented to me. I am excited to join a college community where I will meet people with different perspectives and grow even more as an individual and a communicator. At the end of the day, what I have realized is that, to find your voice, you need to embrace challenges, commit, and practice.",0,2.461401877,2.843454561,2.971234835,3.185678984,2.893072547,12.0,16.0,21.4,25.0,18.0
C2,240,"The journey to finding my voice was like walking through a dense forest, where every step forward came with the risk of getting lost in unfamiliar terrain. Yet, I never lost hope for finding my voice, just like how the sun rays never gave up on finding their way through the darkest parts of the woods. Early on, when my confidence was low, communication seemed like an impossible feat. My stuttering and garbled speech made me feel like an outsider, like I was trying to break through a brick wall with my bare hands. Wishing I could communicate like others, I found solace in books and stories. One book, in particular, shared the story of a boy with a speech impediment. I read this book over and over again, always finding something new to relate to. My endeavor to communicate better started small; by reaching out to family and close friends whom I trusted to be patient with me. Nevertheless, my voice still felt like a butterfly caught in a spider's web; its wings tied and its body struggling to escape. I knew I needed to do more to strengthen my voice and communicate effectively with others. My journey to find my voice began when I joined the debate team. Our practice space was in a library with old, musty books lining the shelves. The rustling of pages and the sound of keys clicking on the computer keys was the rhythm that accompanied me as I prepared to debate. My palms were sweaty as I approached the chair to speak, but with each debate, my confidence grew. The more I observed other debaters' techniques and incorporated them into my own, the more my stuttering began to disappear into the background. Despite my successes, I still found myself unable to speak effectively within a more casual setting. That is when I discovered the power of teaching. The classroom was not unlike the forest that humans had fashioned themselves into. The students were like trees, each with a unique quality and sound, waiting to be heard. The sound of the chairs scraping the floor, pencils tapping against the desk, and the scattered colors of poster boards evoked memories of my own middle school days. As I taught each student, my voice became stronger, and I was better able to express myself. As I continued to hone my communication skills, I realized that finding my voice meant more than just speaking confidently; it also meant listening and embracing the unique sounds and harmonies of others. Joining choir was the moment I truly learned this lesson. When I walked into the choir room, I smelled the fading scent of perfume and saw the vibrant color of the choir robes. The soft whispers of choristers rehearsing their parts surrounded me. At first, it was daunting, trying to find my voice among everyone else's sound. But I soon learned that harmonizing was about listening, taking cues from others' sounds, and adjusting your voice to complement theirs. It was a metaphor for how communication is not just about speaking your voice but also hearing and appreciating others'. It's been a few years since I started this journey, and I've come a long way since my days as an introverted student. Sometimes, I still struggle with speaking to others, but now, I feel like I'm walking through the dense forest with a map in my hand. I am better equipped to navigate the twists and turns of conversations and hear the beauty in everyone's voice. When I speak, it's like the sun rays shining through the leaves to reach the forest floor, casting a soft and gentle light on everything around me. In conclusion, the journey to finding my voice was a winding path full of uncertainties and obstacles. But it was also full of golden moments, where memories of the sounds, sights, and smells around me guided me forward. It is because of the experiences that I've accrued along the way, from debating to teaching to choir, that I am able to communicate with confidence and find my voice. At Yale or Harvard, I hope to continue to build on this foundation and become the best communicator that I can be. My journey has taught me that the beauty of communication is the harmonious sounds and textures brought out by everyone's unique voice, and it is something that I wish to experience in the years to come.",0,2.666865437,2.821281972,2.995852286,3.279583653,2.861277585,14.0,17.0,22.0,25.0,20.0
H,241,"What does it mean to be an advocate? I didn’t find the answer in any sort of textbook. Not the anatomy textbook that lay across the foot of my bed, filled with Post-Its and half-drawn diagrams. Nor the chemistry textbook that sat on top of it, covered in streaks of blue highlighter. Not even Principles of Biology, overflowing with illegible notes and loose worksheets, had the answer. Yet, in a few years, I will be promising to do just that: be the ultimate advocate for my patients. My search for the answer began quite unintentionally. When I was initially recommended to serve on the Youth Council my junior year of high school, my perspective on civic engagement was one of apathy and a complete lack of interest. I couldn’t understand how my passion for the medical field had any correlation with serving as a representative for the students at my school and actively engaging within the political sphere. I knew I wanted to pursue a career as a physician, and I was perfectly content embracing the safety net of my introverted textbook world. But that safety net was ripped wide open the day I walked through the sliding double doors of City Hall for my first Youth Council meeting. I assumed I would spend my hour flipping through flashcards and studying for next week’s unit test, while a bunch of teenagers complained about the lack of donuts in the student store. Instead, I listened to the stories of 18 students, all of whom were using their voices to reshape the distribution of power within their communities and break the structures that chained so many in a perpetual cycle of desperation and despair. While I spent most of my time poring over a textbook trying to memorize formulas and theorems, they were spending their time using those formulas and theorems to make a difference in their communities. Needless to say, that meeting sparked an inspirational flame within me. The next Youth Council meeting, I asked questions. I gave feedback. I noticed what the students at my school were really struggling with. For the first time, I went to drug prevention assemblies and helped my friends run mental health workshops. The more involved I became in my city’s Youth Council, the more I understood how similar being an advocate for your community is to being an advocate for your patients. When I volunteered at the hospital every week, I started paying attention to more than whether or not my patients wanted ice chips in their water. I learned that Deborah was campaigning for equal opportunity housing in a deeply segregated neighborhood and George was a paramedic who injured his leg carrying an 8-year-old with an allergic reaction to the Emergency Room. I might not have been the doctor who diagnosed them but I was often the one person who saw them as human beings rather than patients. Youth Council isn’t something most students with a passion in practicing medicine chose to participate in, and it certainly wasn’t something I thought would have such an immense impact on the way I view patient care. As a patient’s ultimate advocate, a physician must look beyond hospital gowns and IV tubes and see the world through the eyes of another. Rather than treat diseases, a physician must choose to treat a person instead, ensuring compassionate care is provided to all. While I know that throughout my academic career I will take countless classes that will teach me everything from stoichiometry to cellular respiration, I refuse to take the knowledge I learn and simply place it on a flashcard to memorize. I will use it to help those whom I must be an advocate for: my patients.",1,2.569286056,2.957876447,3.413242001,3.73776235,3.148330762,11.4,18.0,26.0,32.0,22.0
C0,242,"As I walk into the hospital room, I take a deep breath and steel myself. I'm here to advocate for a patient who cannot speak for themselves. This isn't just a job or volunteer opportunity for me, it's a passion. Advocacy in patient care is a topic near and dear to my heart, and it's something that I hope to continue throughout my life. When I was six years old, my grandfather had a stroke. I remember going to visit him in the hospital, and how lost and alone he seemed. My family and I were there to support him, but we couldn't be with him all the time. It was then that I realized just how important advocacy is in patient care. Now, as a high school senior, I've had the opportunity to volunteer at a hospital and see firsthand how advocacy can make a difference in a patient's life. I've learned that being an advocate means more than just speaking up for a patient; it means understanding their needs and wants, and doing everything possible to ensure that they receive the care they deserve. One of the most important aspects of advocacy is communication. It's not just about speaking up for the patient, but also about listening to them. Patients are often scared and vulnerable, and they need someone who is willing to hear their concerns and address them in a way that is clear and compassionate. This has been a key factor in my success as an advocate – being able to connect with the patient on a personal level and make them feel heard. In addition to communication, advocacy also involves education. This means not only educating the patient about their condition and treatment options, but also educating the healthcare providers about the patient's needs and preferences. Healthcare professionals are busy and often overwhelmed, and it's easy for them to forget that they are dealing with a whole person, not just a set of symptoms. Advocates can help bridge that gap and ensure that the patient's voice is heard. I have seen firsthand how advocacy can impact patient care. One example that stands out to me involved a woman who was receiving chemotherapy. She was experiencing severe nausea and vomiting, but was reluctant to speak up about it because she didn't want to be a bother. I noticed that she seemed uncomfortable and asked her if she was feeling okay. She confided in me that she was experiencing these symptoms, but was afraid to tell her doctor because she didn't want to be seen as a difficult patient. I immediately brought this to the attention of the nurse, and we were able to work together to find a solution. We spoke with the doctor about adjusting her medications, and we also provided her with support and encouragement. In the end, she was able to complete her treatment with minimal discomfort, and she was grateful for the extra attention. This experience taught me that advocacy goes beyond simply speaking up for a patient – it means creating a safe and supportive environment where patients feel comfortable sharing their concerns. Through volunteering at the hospital and shadowing healthcare professionals, I have also learned that advocating for patients can be challenging at times. Some healthcare providers may view advocates as an interference, or may not fully understand the role that advocates play. I have learned that it is important to be respectful and mindful of others, but also to remain persistent in the face of challenges. By working collaboratively and respectfully with healthcare providers, advocates can help bridge the gap between patients and their care teams, ultimately leading to better outcomes. Advocacy in patient care is a topic that is increasingly important in today's healthcare landscape. With the rise of technology and the growing complexity of medical treatments, patients are facing a more challenging and sometimes overwhelming healthcare environment. Advocates can help provide the support and guidance that patients need to navigate this complex system. Looking to the future, I hope to continue advocating for patient care in college and beyond. As I pursue a career in healthcare, I know that advocacy will be an important part of my practice. Whether working with individual patients or advocating for systemic change, I am committed to improving the lives of those in need. In conclusion, advocacy in patient care is a passion of mine that has been sparked by personal experience. I believe that advocacy is critical in improving patient outcomes and providing compassionate care. It involves communication, education, and persistence, and it requires a deep commitment to the wellbeing of patients. I look forward to continuing this work in college and throughout my career, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to a greater cause.",0,2.58387435,2.816401697,2.994272442,3.103727699,2.858436834,14.0,16.0,21.0,25.0,18.0
C1,243,"The term 'advocate' is hard to define explicitly as it transcends definitions in a textbook. It is an art that requires a range of skills, including empathy, communication, and perseverance. As I prepare for higher education, where I hope to become a healthcare professional, I realize that being an advocate for my patients is a responsibility that I will have to take up with utmost seriousness. Through my experiences serving on the Youth Council and volunteering at the local hospital, I have seen how advocacy can reshape the healthcare industry, making it more compassionate and more all-encompassing. But it's not just healthcare that requires advocacy. Advocacy is a necessary attribute for many fields and situations. I've learned that advocacy takes on many forms, and a true advocate is one who knows the implications of their actions, the power of their words, and the empathy of their actions. Every advocate has a purpose or cause they believe in, and as I continue on my journey to advocacy, I find my purpose rooted in positively impacting others through healthcare. More than ever, the world needs consistent health care that prioritizes empathy, compassion, and patient well-being above all else. The doctor-patient relationship needs to be strong and nurturing. Professionals must provide their patients with the care and support they need, understanding, and addressing their emotional and mental needs in addition to their physical ailments. At the hospital, it was a guarantee that at least one patient would break down in tears or curl up into a ball from overwhelming pain. This spectacle left a deep impression on me. It was undoubtedly evident that at times, patients appreciate compassion and understanding far more than medical treatments. My experience has shown me that a doctor's job involves far more than prescribing medications and carrying out procedures. Effective advocacy can help to relieve a patient's anxiety levels and ensure their satisfaction in the healthcare system. Taking up the mantle of an advocate might bring challenging and uncomfortable assignments that demand urgency and immediacy. But that's the beauty of being an advocate; it molds us into speakers of truth and agents of change. Advocacy isn’t just about speaking up; it’s about listening as well. Hearing patients' stories brings us closer to their condition and fuses a sense of responsibility to their well-being. Hospital patients are often far from home, in unfamiliar environments, struggling with uncertain conditions. At the same time, vulnerable populations might feel overwhelmed and subject to systematic neglect. As I remember those patients' faces, the anguish in their eyes, the tears streaming down their cheeks, I know for certain that advocacy is the way to go. It’s what can brighten up the corners of their world and bring a much-needed glimmer of hope to their place. As I prepare to enter the next phase of my education, I am looking to combine my passion with a purpose. It is my ultimate goal to use the experiences that I have gathered through serving on the Youth Council and volunteering at the hospital, coupled with the resources provided within the walls of esteemed universities like Yale and Harvard to build a career rooted in effective advocacy. Advocacy is a versatile skill that is invaluable in driving change in any field, and I believe that this makes it an integral characteristic that I will need to be a successful healthcare professional. Ultimately, realizing my goal of becoming a healthcare professional will require more than grades and test scores. It will require a framework of empathy, the ability to put myself in another’s shoes, speak out on behalf of vulnerable populations, and embrace the challenges presented in the healthcare industry. I am committed to this path, and I believe that through serving as an advocate, I can contribute to creating a more comprehensive healthcare system that truly serves the needs of all patients.",0,2.701670012,2.992375647,3.148385598,3.515416002,3.084606253,14.0,18.0,20.4,31.0,19.0
C2,244,"The sound of the hospital intercom blares through the halls, signaling the start of another long day. A hint of antiseptic fills the air as I walk through the wards, steeling myself for what is to come. Behind every door is a patient, a person just like you and me, fighting a battle that they never asked for. I remember my first day volunteering at the local hospital. I had no idea what to expect, but I knew I wanted to make a difference in people's lives. My job was simple – to provide comfort and support to patients, to be there for them when they needed it the most. That day, I met a young boy with a heart condition. His parents were beside themselves, worried about their son's health and future. The boy was scared and confused, unsure of what was happening to him. I sat with him for a while, listening to his story and trying to alleviate his fears. In that moment, I realized that being an advocate meant more than just speaking up for others; it meant being there for them, offering a shoulder to cry on when needed, and being a source of comfort and support. As I continued my volunteer work at the hospital, I saw firsthand the importance of empathy in healthcare. Patients were not just bodies lying in beds; they were people with emotions, feelings, and fears. They needed healthcare professionals who would treat them as individuals, not just as a collection of symptoms. I met a woman who had been in a car accident and suffered multiple fractures. She was in excruciating pain and couldn't move without assistance. As I sat with her, she told me how helpless she felt, and how she missed her family. I could see the despair written on her face, and I knew that she needed more than just physical help. So, I sat with her for a while, listening to her story, and offering what comfort I could. In that moment, I realized that advocacy meant treating patients as whole individuals, not just their medical conditions. Advocacy requires us to be fearless, to speak out against injustice, and to fight for what is right. Healthcare professionals have a unique opportunity to advocate for their patients, to ensure that they receive the care and support they need. But it's not just about speaking up; it's about listening too. Patients have stories to tell, and their experiences are just as important as their diagnoses. I met an elderly man who had been in the hospital for weeks. He was lonely and scared, missing his wife who had passed away years ago. He would tell me stories about his life, and how much he missed his family. One day, I asked him if he wanted me to read him a book. He nodded, and I started reading to him. For a while, there was silence in the room, except for the sound of my voice. As I finished the book, I looked up, and tears were streaming down his face. In that moment, I realized that advocacy meant being there for patients, even when they didn't ask for it. As I prepare for higher education, I know that advocacy will be a vital part of my future career as a healthcare professional. I want to be the kind of doctor who takes the time to listen to her patients, to understand their fears, and to provide the support they need. I want to be the kind of doctor who fights for her patients, who advocates for their rights, and who ensures that they receive the care they deserve. Being an advocate is not just a responsibility; it's an honor. It's an opportunity to make a real difference in people's lives, to be there for them when they need it the most. And as I enter the next phase of my education, I know that I will face challenges along the way. But I am ready for them. I am ready to be an advocate for patients, to fight for their rights, to listen to their stories, and to make a difference in their lives. In conclusion, advocacy is a vital attribute in the healthcare industry, and it's not just for healthcare professionals. Everyone can be an advocate, whether it's for a family member, a friend, or a stranger. Advocacy requires empathy, perseverance, and a willingness to listen. It requires us to take a stand, to speak out against injustice, and to fight for what is right. As I prepare for higher education, I know that advocacy will be an integral part of my future career as a healthcare professional.

H,245,"Step 1: Get the ingredients On the granite countertop in front of me sat a pile of flour, two sticks of butter, and a bowl of shredded beef, just like the YouTube tutorial showed. My mind contorted itself as I tried figuring out what I was doing. Flanking me were two equally discombobulated partners from my Spanish class. Somehow, some way, the amalgamation of ingredients before us would have to be transformed into Peruvian empanadas. Step 2: Prepare the ingredients It looked easy enough. Just make a dough, cook the beef until it was tender, put two and two together, and fry them. What YouTube didn’t show was how to season the meat or how long you should cook it. We had to put this puzzle together by ourselves. Adding to the mystery, none of us knew what an empanada should even taste like. Step 3: Roll out ten equally sized circles of dough It would be dishonest to say everything went smoothly. I thought the dough should be thick. One team member thought it should be thin. The other thought our circles were squares. A fundamental truth about collaboration is that it’s never uncontentious. Everyone has their own expectations about how things should be done. Everyone wants a project to go their way. Collaboration requires observing the differences between the collaborators and finding a way to synthesize everyone’s contributions into a solution that is mutually agreeable. Step 4: Cook the beef until tender Collaborative endeavors are the proving grounds for Murphy’s Law: everything that can go wrong, will go wrong. The shredded beef, which was supposed to be tender, was still hard as a rock after an hour on the stove. With our unseasoned cooking minds, all ideas were valid. Put more salt in? Sure. Cook it at a higher temperature? Go for it. Collaboration requires people to be receptive. It demands an open mind. All ideas deserve consideration. Step 5: Fry the empanadas until crispy What does crispy even mean? How crispy is crispy enough; how crispy is too crispy? The back and forth with my teammates over everything from how thick the dough should be to the definition of crispy taught me a key ingredient of teamwork: patience. Collaboration breeds tension, which can make teamwork so frustrating. But it’s that very tension which also transforms differing perspectives into solutions that propel collaborative undertakings forward.

C0,246,"It was a warm summer day in Lima, Peru, and I was standing in the kitchen with three generations of my family, preparing to cook empanadas. With the smell of freshly chopped cilantro and the sound of my relatives laughing in the background, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unity and joy. Our family's recipe brought us together, and with each step of the process, I realized the importance of working together toward a shared goal. As I watched my aunt knead the dough with precise and practiced movements, my grandmother began to fill it with seasoned chicken and onions. Meanwhile, my uncle and I took turns sealing the dough and shaping the empanadas to perfection. Without even realizing it, we were in sync, each of us adding our own unique touch to the dish. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that cooking empanadas wasn't just about following the recipe. It was a way for my family to connect and bond, using our shared love for food as a starting point. As we worked, my great-grandmother told me about how she learned to cook empanadas as a young girl, using simple ingredients from their family farm. 'It was a way for us to make something out of nothing,' she said with a smile. 'And more importantly, it brought our family together.' For my family, cooking is much more than just a way to nourish our bodies. It's a way to honor our traditions and connect with each other. And in that moment, I knew that the same could be true for people all over the world. Whether it was through cooking or some other shared activity, there was something special about coming together as a team. As I thought more about this idea, I began to realize that working as a team wasn't limited to just cooking. It can be applied to every aspect of life, from academics to extracurricular activities. When we work together, we pool our strengths and ideas, creating something that's truly greater than the sum of its parts. Throughout high school, I've had the opportunity to work with many different teams, each with its unique personalities and challenges. From debate club to sports teams, I've learned that there's a certain magic that happens when a group of individuals comes together with a shared goal. While each team had its ups and downs, one experience in particular stands out in my mind. During my sophomore year, I was part of the robotics team at my school. Our goal was to design and build a robot that could compete in a national tournament. At first, the task seemed daunting. We had a diverse group of individuals with different skill sets and backgrounds. But as we began to work together, something clicked. Just like in the kitchen with my family, we found that each of us brought something unique to the table. Some of us were better at programming, while others were more skilled at mechanical design. But rather than letting our differences divide us, we used them to our advantage. As we worked long hours into the night, I began to see the same sense of joy and unity that I had felt in the kitchen with my family. Sure, we were exhausted and stressed at times, but there was something invigorating about the shared experience of working toward a common goal. In the end, our robot performed well in the tournament, and we were proud of what we had accomplished as a team. But more than that, I was struck by the power of teamwork and the sense of community that it can create. As I look ahead to college, I'm excited by the prospect of finding new teams to join and new challenges to tackle. Maybe it'll be a chemistry lab or a group dedicated to social justice. Whatever it is, I know that my experiences in the kitchen and on the robotics team have prepared me to work collaboratively and effectively toward a shared goal. So maybe the recipe for success isn't all that complicated after all. Just like cooking empanadas, it's about coming together with a shared passion and a willingness to work hard. And whether it's in the kitchen or the lab, the power of teamwork is unbeatable.",0,2.527708295,2.751792635,2.8490407,3.115495664,2.787008519,14.0,17.0,20.0,23.4,19.0
C1,247,"It was a typical weekday afternoon, and I found myself standing in front of a granite countertop with two classmates from my Spanish class. The countertop was covered with all of the ingredients we needed to make Peruvian empanadas, but neither of us knew what to do next. We were trying to follow a YouTube tutorial, but as we soon discovered, there was a lot the tutorial left out. We quickly realized that we didn't know how to season the meat or how long we should cook it. We didn't know how thick the dough should be, or what exactly 'crispy' meant in terms of frying the empanadas. We were completely lost. But rather than give up, we decided to figure it out together. We each had our own ideas about what to do, but we listened to each other and tried to find a solution that worked for everyone. It wasn't always easy - in fact, it was pretty contentious at times - but we persevered. As we worked, I thought about how this experience was similar to my family's tradition of cooking empanadas together. Just like my family shouted out opinions and suggestions, we also had to work through our differences and find a way to collaborate effectively. It wasn't always smooth sailing, but by the end of it, we had created something delicious and satisfying. Throughout high school, I've had many opportunities to work collaboratively, both inside and outside the classroom. Whether it was in group projects, sports teams, or extracurricular clubs, I've learned that teamwork is essential to success. It's not always easy, but it's always worth it. I think of my experience on the robotics team in my sophomore year, when we had to design and build a robot that could compete in a national tournament. In the beginning, it seemed like an insurmountable task. We had a diverse group of individuals with different backgrounds and skills, and we had to find a way to work together. At first, it was tough. We had disagreements, and some of us weren't sure we had the skills to contribute to the project. But as we worked together, something started to click. We all brought unique skills and strengths to the table, and as we shared our ideas, we began to understand how we could work together to accomplish something great. It wasn't always easy. We had long nights and challenging setbacks, but we stuck with it. In the end, we built a robot that performed well in the tournament, and we all felt proud of what we had accomplished as a team. Looking back, I realize that my experiences with teamwork have taught me a lot. I've learned the importance of listening to others, being patient and persistent, and most importantly, trusting the people around me. When working in a team, it's crucial to understand that everyone has something valuable to offer, even if it's not immediately apparent. As I think about the future, I know that I'll continue to encounter situations where teamwork is key. Whether it's in college, graduate school, or my future career, I know that I'll need to be able to work collaboratively with others to achieve success. But that's okay. In fact, it's something I'm looking forward to. Because when you work as part of a team, you're not just working to achieve a goal - you're also building relationships and forging a sense of community. And that's something that's truly valuable, no matter what your end goal may be. So whether it's in a kitchen in Lima, a robotics lab in high school, or a boardroom in a Fortune 500 company, I know that I'll be ready to tackle any challenge that comes my way.

C2,248,"I found myself walking down the street lined with bright yellow and green trees, their vibrant colors reminiscent of a Monet painting. The sounds of birds singing and children laughing filled the air as I made my way to the community garden where I volunteered every week. The garden was a haven amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. The raised beds were overflowing with a rainbow of colors - orange squash, red tomatoes, green kale, and purple eggplant. I could smell the herbs and flowers growing nearby, their fragrances mixing together in a delicate dance. I loved working in the garden because it was a chance to connect with nature and with other people who shared a passion for sustainability. We spent hours digging in the dirt, sharing stories and recipes, and learning new techniques from each other. One day, as we were harvesting some carrots, a woman named Mrs. Sanchez told me about her old family recipe for carrot cake. Her words flowed like a symphony, each step of the recipe sounding like music to my ears. I could almost taste the cinnamon and cream cheese frosting as she spoke. I realized that this was what was so special about working in a community garden - it was a chance to connect with people from all different walks of life and learn from their experiences. Whether we were transplanting seedlings, discussing the benefits of companion planting, or sharing our favorite recipes, we were building a sense of community and collaboration. This experience was not unlike my time as a member of the school's debate team. At first, I was intimidated by the prospect of standing up in front of a room full of people and arguing my point. But over time, I grew to love the challenge and the sense of camaraderie that came with working with my teammates to prepare for debates. As we worked together, I picked up different techniques from my teammates. The way one person structured their argument, or the use of a particularly powerful piece of evidence. We were always learning and improving, both as individuals and as a team. But debates were also about the broader context - the issues that we were passionate about and the ways in which we could make a difference. We had all chosen to be a part of the debate team because we wanted to engage with the world around us, and because we believed in the power of dialogue to create change. As I move on to college, I know that I will encounter many more opportunities to work in collaborative environments. Whether it's in the context of research projects or service groups or artistic collectives, I am excited to bring my skills and my passion to the table and to learn from others as we work towards common goals. Of course, I know that there will be challenges along the way. Not all teams are created equal, and some will be more successful than others. But I believe that even in the most difficult situations, there is always something to be learned or gained. Ultimately, I think that teamwork is about more than just individual successes or failures. It's about creating something that is greater than the sum of its parts - something that reflects the unique contributions and perspectives of each member of the team. It's about building relationships, forging connections, and learning from the world around us. As I think about the next chapter of my life, I know that I am ready for whatever challenges and opportunities come my way. Whether I am cooking in a kitchen, collaborating on a project, or debating a pressing issue, I will be there as a passionate and dedicated member of the team.

H,249,"Legends, lore, and comic books all feature mystical, beautiful beings and superheroes—outspoken powerful Greek goddesses, outspoken Chinese maidens, and outspoken blade-wielding women. As a child, I soared the skies with my angel wings, battled demons with katanas, and helped stop everyday crime (and of course had a hot boyfriend). In short, I wanted to save the world. But growing up, my definition of superhero shifted. My peers praised people who loudly fought inequality, who rallied and shouted against hatred. As a journalist on a social-justice themed magazine, I spent more time at protests, interviewing and understanding but not quite feeling inspired by their work. At first, I despaired. Then I realized: I’m not a superhero. I’m just a 17-year-old girl with a Nikon and a notepad—and I like it that way. And yet—I want to save the world. This understanding didn’t arrive as a bright, thundering revelation; it settled in softly on a warm spring night before my 17th birthday, around the fourth hour of crafting my journalism portfolio. I was choosing the best photos I’d taken around town during the 2016 presidential election when I unearthed two shots. The first was from a peace march—my classmates, rainbows painted on their cheeks and bodies wrapped in American flags. One raised a bullhorn to her mouth, her lips forming a loud O. Months later, I could still hear her voice. The second was different. The cloudy morning following election night seemed to shroud the school in gloom. In the mist, however—a golden face, with dark hair and two moon-shaped eyes, faces the camera. Her freckles, sprinkled like distant stars across the expanse of her round cheeks, only accentuated her childlike features and added to the soft feel of the photo. Her eyes bore into something beyond the lens, beyond the photographer, beyond the viewer—everything is rigid, from the jut of her jaw, to her stitched brows, her upright spine and arms locked across her chest, to her shut mouth. I picked the second picture within a heartbeat. During my career as a photojournalist, I lived for the action shots: the excited gestures of a school board member discussing plans, a rabbi preaching vividly, a group of teenagers chanting and waving flags downtown. To me, the most energetic photos always told the biggest and best stories. They made me feel important for being there, for capturing the superheroes in the moment to share with everyone else. The softer moments paled in comparison, and I thought of them as irrelevant. It took about one second to tear down one year’s worth of belief. The idea dawned on me when I was trapped within the distraught weight in the girl’s eyes. Sometimes the moments that speak the loudest aren’t the noisiest or the most energetic. Sometimes they’re quiet, soft, and peaceful. Now, I still don’t completely understand who I am and who I want to be, but really, who does? I’m not a superhero—but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to save the world. There are just so many ways to do it. You don’t always have to be loud to inflict change. Sometimes, it begins quietly: a snap of the shutter; a scrape of ink on paper. A breathtaking photograph; an astonishing lede. I’ve noticed the impact creativity can have and how powerful it is to harness it. So, with that, I make people think and understand those surrounding them. I play devil’s advocate in discussions about ethics and politics. I persuade those around me to think past what they know into the scary territory of what they don’t—so to make people feel. I’m determined to inspire people to think more about how they can be their own superheroes and more. See, that’s the kind of world-saving I do.",1,2.226518203,2.464433509,2.691054907,3.170015428,2.570934107,8.0,13.0,15.0,20.0,14.0
C0,250,"Throughout our lives, we often search for big moments that will bring about significant changes. We dream of getting accepted into our top choice college or landing the perfect job, thinking that these milestones will suddenly make everything fall into place. However, I believe that it is the small, soft moments that accumulate and ultimately bring about major changes in our lives. Growing up, my family always told me that kindness goes a long way. It wasn't until I began volunteering at my local homeless shelter that I fully understood the power of small acts of kindness. At the shelter, I met dozens of people who had hit rock bottom, lost everything, and were in desperate need of help. As a volunteer, I was tasked with serving food and cleaning up, but it was the conversations I had with the guests that left the largest impression on me. I remember one guest, Laurie, who sat by herself every night. We started chatting and I learned that her husband had recently passed away, and she had lost her job not long after. If she hadn't been fired, she would've been able to keep her apartment and have a roof over her head. But as luck would have it, she lost everything all at once. She was genuinely alone and fell into a state of deep depression. Serving her dinner and asking her about her day was a small act of kindness, but it quickly became the highlight of her night. Every person living in the shelter had a story, and every story reminded me that you never know what someone is going through. Being kind and gentle to Laurie and others made the biggest difference in my life. Listening to their stories and trying to help them in any way possible gave me an appreciation for small, soft moments of connection. It's not about expecting someone to throw a parade in your honor or delivering a ground-breaking speech to a massive audience. It's about the little nods of understanding or checking up on someone, that make a significant difference in their life, and in yours. As I continued volunteering at the shelter, I began to extend my acts of kindness beyond my role as a volunteer. I started by checking on Laurie every day and helping her rebuild her life. I contacted a friend of mine who owned a local diner and arranged for her to work there. It was a simple phone call that completely transformed Laurie's life. I quickly realized that the joy and happiness which flowed from these soft moments of compassion and support encouraged me to keep making small changes that had a big impact. Through these acts of kindness, I started to view my own struggles through a different lens. I came to understand that the moments that seemed small and insignificant, like showing up at a friend's wedding or saying hello to someone walking down the street, could have profound impacts. Soft moments are the foundation of social progress. Moments of powerful emotion that change the world only occur when we open ourselves up to those soft moments. One experience that solidified my understanding of this was when I attended a climate justice rally. The rally seemed immense, with thousands of like-minded people gathered in one place, all of us demanding justice and change. But in the midst of the noise and overwhelming emotions, I saw something truly remarkable. A young boy, no more than seven years old, approached the microphone to speak. His voice was barely above a whisper; you had to strain your ears to hear him. Nonetheless, he spoke with conviction and resolve, arguing that he didn't want to grow up in a world where people did not have any fresh water or air to breathe. This little boy’s soft yet impassioned tone transformed an atmosphere already fizzling with zeal, amplifying the urgency of the cause that we were all gathering for. It was this boy who made me realise that soft moments truly do make the biggest changes. We may not always realize it, but the moments we think are insignificant because they are not broadcast over the news, shared on major social media sites, or talked about by the entire nation or world may actually be paving the way for significant changes in our future. It is these moments that form the building blocks of long-lasting and enduring transformation. Whether it is a volunteer shift at a homeless shelter, a phone call to an estranged friend, or a brief speech before a climate rally, these small moments may seem fleeting, but they truly make more of an impact than we may realize. It's challenging to imagine all the tiny actions that contributed to the positive changes you see in the world today. We must pay closer attention to those small moments of compassion and connection, because they ultimately propel us forward. As I move on to the next stage of my life, I intend to continue to embrace the power of soft moments, taking small steps toward significant changes.",0,2.667026141,2.765967446,2.93924489,3.109148255,2.867238194,14.0,18.0,21.0,26.0,20.0
C1,251,"From peaceful protests, online petitions, social media campaigns, boycotts, and marches to direct action, people around the world have devised various methods to stand up for issues they consider valuable, including inequality, corruption, and other social injustices. However, as noise and crowds accompany many such forms of activism, I have always found them overwhelming, tiring and sometimes intimidating. Consequently, I have discovered the significance of quiet activism, whose impact often goes unnoticed, overlooked but effective. Quiet activism may not generate headlines, honors, massive support, or significant donations, but it provides the most effective solutions to problems often ignored by the world. The kind of activism that requires no grand gestures, just small intentional actions that accumulate over time, affecting our communities positively. This kind of activism often employs empathy, and dedication to well-thought-out actions that contribute to an overall positive impact. My conviction to embrace quiet activism came when I saw how much impact it could make to establish a tangible solution. I utilize this tactic to assist refugees who have migrated to my community as they seek to make sense of their surrounding environment. Most of them lack the necessary support to settle into their new locality and face challenges such as language barrier, lack of basic resources, and cultural shock. I volunteer my time to tutor their children and help them grasp fundamental concepts that go a long way to establish a solid foundation for their continued education. Every time the eyes of the children light up as they grasp a concept, it reminds me that small intentional actions bring a considerable impact, especially in society. Moreover, quiet activism ensures that everyone has the opportunity to participate regardless of their circumstances, and everyone has something to bring to the table. Whether it is a small donation, volunteering time, or sharing experiences, the smallest contribution can make all the difference for an individual or group. In this era where the world needs more innovative solutions to persistent problems, it is inspiring to embrace the kind of activism that requires empathy and understanding. Quiet activism establishes a conducive environment for dialogue, establishing common grounds, and understanding each other's perspectives. It takes an understanding of different perspectives and a willingness to work with others to create a sustainable solution. Rather than focusing on the speed at which things happen or the immediate impact, quiet activism prioritizes creating lasting sustainable solutions. Taking our time to understand and establish the root causes of the issues at hand will lead to solutions that are more robust and inclusive and, therefore, more impactful. In conclusion, quiet activism is often forged through simple acts of kindness and empathy, which go a long way in creating sustainable solutions over the long run. We all have the agency to make a difference, regardless of situation or platform. A willingness to listen, establish common ground and the ability to communicate with others is critical when fighting for what we believe in. I firmly believe that our collective effort towards quiet activism can lead to a significant difference in our society, and hopefully bring about long-term and sustainable change. All in all, quiet activism is just as valuable and powerful as any other form of activism, and we should celebrate and embrace it as a critical part of the larger movement for justice and lasting peace.",0,2.907986644,3.147041666,3.237654913,3.416969822,3.168457978,19.8,22.6,26.2,27.6,24.0
C2,252,"It was one of those lazy afternoons, and my phone was buzzing with notifications from social media. A rally was happening downtown, and I felt a pang of guilt for not being there. But then again, the loud cheers and crowds always made me feel disconnected from the message. It was only when I volunteered at a refugee camp that I discovered the potency of quiet activism. The camp was a cacophony of sounds, filled with children's laughter, women chattering, and men haggling over mundane matters. But amid the apparent chaos, I noticed a young girl, Bintu, struggling with her homework. She sat alone, her dark eyes scanning the pages of a book in frustration. I walked over and offered to help, and she lit up at my offer. As we delved into the work, I realized how powerful quiet activism could be. It was a small action, but it had immense significance for Bintu. The sense of accomplishment as Bintu finally understood the concept was akin to a victory cry in a football game. I realized that this small accomplishment held immense significance, not just for Bintu, but for her family and the rest of the community. Quiet activism may not have loud cheers, or visible impacts, but it is crucial in creating lasting, sustainable change. Subtle actions that accumulate over an extended period can be incredibly effective in bringing about change. From helping the elderly with their shopping to spending time with individuals who need emotional support, quiet activism is essential in creating an inclusive community. It requires individuals to be present and aware, and most importantly, empathetic. Quiet activism can provide an inclusive platform where everyone can contribute to the larger movement. Everyone has a voice, and even the most subtle contribution can make a considerable impact. From offering free transportation to refugees to donating food to a homeless shelter, every action contributes to building a better society. The constant feeling of uncertainty and insecurity refugees face often results in low self-esteem, depression, and anxiety. Volunteering my time to tutor refugee children helps provide much-needed stability and the promise of a brighter future. The look of hope in their eyes when they grasp a concept, the smile on their faces when they finally read fluently, is priceless. Quiet activism often prioritizes sustainable solutions that last for an extended period. Rather than focusing on the speed at which things happen, it focuses on creating positive, sustainable change. Sometimes, this may mean an individual making a small, conscious effort to turn off their lights when not in use to reduce the overall carbon footprint. It may only result in a minor impact, but it is not insignificant, and it can inspire others to do the same. In essence, quiet activism establishes a conducive environment for dialogue, understanding, and creating a sustainable solution. It takes the willingness to work with others, establishing common grounds, and being open-minded. Like a gardener, it requires patience and perseverance in creating an inclusive and equitable society. In conclusion, quiet activism is a testament to the power of empathy, kindness, and hard work. It is essential in creating an inclusive society, providing hope to the marginalized, and advocating for positive lasting change. It may not generate the most support or massive donations, but it is an authentic movement, built on the values of compassion and a deep desire for a better society. Quiet activism is just as valuable and powerful as any other form of activism, and we should celebrate and embrace it as a critical part of the larger movement for justice and lasting peace.",0,2.582020549,2.695784292,2.876597599,3.143342166,2.767289161,14.4,16.0,18.0,21.6,17.0
H,253,"“It’s a hot and humid day in Swat Valley, Pakistan A young student boards the school bus since walking is no longer safe She sits, chatting with her friends after a long day of exams A man jumps onto the bus and pulls out a gun The last thing the girl remembers is the sound of three gunshots BANG, BANG, BANG Her name is Malala and she was fourteen years old Shot for no reason other than her desire to learn We will FIGHT until girls don’t live with fear of attending school We will FIGHT until education is a freedom, a right, an expectation for everyone” This is the first stanza of a piece of slam poetry my friend and I wrote and performed at our school’s rendition of TED Talks. Over lunch one day, we discovered we shared a common passion—an insistence on equality in all forms, feminism in particular. We discussed the difficulty of combating social issues, but agreed that spreading awareness was one effective method. This casual exchange evolved into a project involving weeks of collaboration. We realized that together we could make a far greater impact than we ever could have individually, so we composed a ten-minute poem aimed at inspiring people to consider important issues. We began by drafting stanzas, simultaneously editing one another’s writing, and later progressed to memorization, practicing together until our alternating lines flowed and phrases spoken together were completely synchronized. The performance was both memorable and successful, but more importantly, this collaboration motivated us to move forward to establish the Equality Club at our school. Sophomore year, our club volunteered with organizations promoting gender equality, the highlight of the year helping at a marathon for recovering abuse victims. Junior year, we met with our head of school to convey our goals, outline plans and gain support for the coming year, in which we held fundraisers for refugees while educating students. This year we are collaborating with the Judicial Committee to reduce the escalating use of racial slurs at school stemming from a lack of awareness within the student body. From this experience, I learned that it is possible to reach so many more people when working together rather than apart. It also taught me that the most crucial aspect of collaborating is believing in the same cause; the details will come as long as there is a shared passion.",1,2.687262221,2.99474857,3.364020076,3.657577362,3.101327695,20.2,23.8,29.0,30.6,27.0
C0,254,"Collaboration is key to equality and activism. One needs the support and knowledge of diverse groups to make significant strides forward. In my life, I’ve often seen the impact of working together and actively seeking knowledge from a diverse group of people. This awareness of how collaboration enhances equality and activism has taught me the importance of engaging with people from all backgrounds. Growing up in a predominantly white, conservative town, I’ve always struggled with finding a sense of belonging. However, I’ve found that by immersing myself in diverse communities, I’ve found the strength to stand up for what I believe in. For example, during my sophomore year, my classmates and I organized a silent demonstration during the national anthem of our school’s football game. We stood with fists raised in the Black Lives Matter symbol to protest the injustices that black Americans faced daily. It was a powerful moment of collaboration, as people from different backgrounds and beliefs came together to support the cause. This moment had a significant impact on the school community, and it helped lead to more open conversations about social injustices. Since then, I’ve continued to pursue collaboration in hopes of making a difference. As a member of my school’s Young Democrats Club, I’ve worked with my fellow members to host voter registration drives and to canvass to promote a specific candidate or issue. Our efforts have led to the registration of dozens of new voters and helped in getting an equal number to show up and vote. However, my most significant experience with collaboration happened while attending a national march for gun control. I had tirelessly worked on this issue since the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, and was thrilled when I got the chance to take part in this event. I was there with a diverse group of people – adults and children, students and teachers – all collaborating to create awareness around the need for gun reform. It was amazing to witness the united effort and works of people who had never met before. Talking to others about their reasons for attending made me realize how collaboration enhances equality and activism by bringing varying views to the table, thus creating a well-rounded conversation. During the march, we talked to many lawmakers to explain why we were asking for stricter gun policies. One senator stood out to me. She listened intently to what we had to say, and we felt heard. She shared how she felt it was essential to advocate for the cause, even if it meant going against what was seen as popular. This motivated me to see how even someone with opposing beliefs can see the importance of collaboration in fighting for justice. Collaboration not only creates a broad range of views and opinions but also challenges one’s own beliefs. One’s experiences and beliefs may be informed by a specific background, culture, or environment. Still, when exposed to different opinions and worldviews, collaboration leads to a better understanding of issues and helps one gain empathy for the struggles of others. This is something I’ve experienced firsthand as a member of the National Honor Society. During the holiday season, our school hosts a charity event in which students participate in various activities to raise money for a chosen organization. At first, I was hesitant to participate because the chosen organization was new to me. However, I decided to take on the role of co-director and found myself leading a group of Nancy, a classmate from a different background. Working with her has made me appreciate the value of teamwork and working with those who have unique experiences. Collaborating with those who have dissimilar beliefs can be challenging, and personalities can clash. However, these debates can enhance discussion and inform one’s perspective. As a member of the school debate team, I’ve seen this firsthand. In one debate, I was paired with someone who had opposing views on a proposal for a bill. Although we had different viewpoints, we worked together to create compelling arguments and supported each other during the competition. This demonstrated how collaboration enhances equality and activism by creating space for discussion and encouraging individuals to work together despite their differences. Collaboration for equality and activism can create a more inclusive and diverse world where everyone’s voice is heard. Through my experiences, I’ve seen how collaboration brings in a broader range of ideas and experiences and helps shape a well-rounded perspective. This understanding of collaboration will continue to guide me in advocating for justice and equality, even in spaces where I may not feel they exist. I aspire to carry this understanding of collaboration as I apply to top-level institutions like Yale and Harvard, where diversity is celebrated and collaboration a valued aspect of education.",0,2.74818199,2.91439968,3.195178436,3.465944045,3.054725722,14.0,18.0,21.0,24.0,20.0
C1,255,"It was a hot August day in Swat Valley, Pakistan. Malala Yousafzai, a fourteen-year-old girl, was shot for the simple reason that she wanted to learn. Malala’s story, which we shared in a slam poem during our school’s TED Talk event, inspired us to take action for gender equality. As we worked on our poem, we realized that we could make a far greater impact together than we could individually. Thus, we founded the Equality Club at our school. Over the years, we have collaborated with a range of organizations on multiple projects. Our sophomore year, we volunteered with organizations that promote gender equality. In our junior year, we met with our school’s head and shared our goals, gaining the support we needed to make a difference. We raised funds for refugees while educating our fellow students about the issues they face. This year, we are working with the Judicial Committee to reduce the use of racial slurs, stemming from a lack of awareness within the student body. Our experience taught us that the most essential part of collaboration is sharing the same passion. We are all united by a belief in the power of education to create social change. Yet, we also recognize that gender inequality is just one aspect of a broader set of hurdles that marginalized groups face. In many parts of the world, girls still lack access to education and economic opportunities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Harmful traditional practices such as child marriage continue to plague certain regions, depriving girls of the chance to realize their full potential. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to gender equality is essential. Organizations like CARE International and UN Women have been working to empower women by providing access to education, skills training, and economic opportunities. CARE’s “She Feeds the World” initiative aims to promote gender equality in agriculture by providing agricultural training and markets for small-scale women farmers in the developing world. Collaboration between businesses, governments, and civil society can also help promote gender equality in the workplace. Corporations can work to eliminate gender biases and ensure equal pay, while governments can introduce legislation to hold businesses accountable for gender discrimination while providing support for families. Civil society can work to ensure that businesses and governments are held accountable and to promote gender equality in all areas of society. Similarly, the Women’s Empowerment Principles (WEPs) have given businesses a framework to promote gender equality and recognize the business case for empowering women. By signing onto the WEPs, businesses commit to eliminate discrimination against women and promote gender equality in hiring, promotion, and compensation. However, universal gender equality cannot be achieved unless intersecting forms of oppression, such as those experienced by marginalized ethnic groups or the LGBTQ+ community, are addressed. Creating an equitable society requires working to empower and uplift all marginalized groups. Intersectional feminist movements recognize that people can be subject to multiple forms of discrimination based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, and other factors. Organizations like Black Lives Matter, Freedom for Immigrants, and Queer Asian Social Club are advocating for diverse populations and creating safe spaces for marginalized communities. As a high school senior, I recognize that it takes a collaborative effort to create positive change. Whether we volunteer, voice our opinions, or attend rallies, we must continue to work together to promote gender equality and education, as well as eliminate all forms of discrimination. In conclusion, gender inequality is a global issue, and to combat it, we need a holistic approach that involves collaboration across multiple sectors. Education, economic opportunities, workplace equity, and intersectionality are all crucial components of a comprehensive strategy for gender equality. Through shared passion and collaborative efforts, we can create a better, more equitable world for all marginalized groups.",0,2.878349916,3.019695166,3.177907437,3.515166546,3.119770281,15.2,18.0,22.6,24.6,21.0
C2,256,"As I walked through the densely populated streets of my hometown, I marveled at the diversity around me. The sights, sounds, and smells of the bustling city painted a vivid and intricate picture of the multicultural atmosphere. The spices intertwined, melding into a unique aroma that would leave anyone feeling nostalgic for their familiar cuisine. The street performers played a symphony of melodies, with each chord tugging at the heartstrings of passersby. The honking of cars and the chatter of voices intermingled, creating a raucous and chaotic symphony of sound. Growing up in this environment, I learned the importance of collaboration, diversity, and creating positive change. It is through these values that I hope to one day attend an Ivy League institution, such as Yale or Harvard, where I can continue to foster my passion for social change and challenging my beliefs. One of my most significant examples of collaboration took place in my junior year of high school. I was part of a group of passionate students who were dedicated to promoting tolerance and understanding. We banded together, forming a task force that aimed to foster a more welcoming environment in our school. We organized events, facilitated discussions, and created spaces where people could voice their opinions freely. In the beginning, we had our fair share of skeptics, doubting the effectiveness of such a group. However, through persistence, hard work, and a continual effort to understand and collaborate with those who had opposed us, we were able to make a significant impact. Our group was instrumental in creating a culture that celebrated, rather than discriminated against, people of different backgrounds. Through this experience, I learned the importance of forging relationships with those who have different beliefs than my own. It helped me realize that working together, even with those who have conflicting ideas, can lead to a more profound understanding and a more substantial impact. I hope that the values of collaboration, diversity, and creating a positive change continue to be a cornerstone of my future endeavors. I strive to immerse myself in an environment where I can challenge my beliefs, collaborate with people of different backgrounds, and create a more equitable world. Furthermore, I envision using the values of collaboration and diversity to pave the way for a more inclusive society. For example, I am currently volunteering with a youth organization focused on promoting racial equality. I have seen firsthand the power of creating a space where children can discuss the complex topics of race, injustice, and privilege. Through collaboration and open-mindedness, the students gain a new understanding of the issues that they face. As I move forward to higher education, I hope to seek out a similar environment where I can continue to hone in on my skills as an advocate for justice and diversity. Harvard and Yale both possess the kind of intellectual and social atmosphere that would undoubtedly mold me to become a more culturally competent and socially aware individual. In conclusion, collaboration can go a long way in enhancing activism and promoting equality. It has taught me that working together, even with people of differing beliefs, can lead to a deeper understanding of an issue or topic. It is a powerful tool for fighting for justice and creating positive change in the world. As a prospective student, I hope the values of collaboration, and diversity can be found and nurtured within the walls of Yale or Harvard. I aspire to use these values to create bridges, elevate others' voices, and change the world for the better.",0,2.898064776,3.006516572,3.11770961,3.207163221,3.049662343,16.6,18.0,19.0,24.8,18.0
H,257,"The first board game I ever played was Disney Princess Monopoly against my mother. It was a shocking experience. My otherwise loving and compassionate mother played to win. Though she patiently explained her strategies throughout the game, she refused to show me any mercy, accumulating one monopoly after another, building house after house, hotel after hotel, and collecting all my money until I was bankrupt, despite my pleas and tears that I was her daughter and only five years old. I remember clearly the pain I felt from losing, but I remained eager to play and determined to one day beat her. Eventually, we left the princesses behind and graduated to the regular, then the deluxe, editions of Monopoly, and expanded to Rummikub. Every time we played, I carefully observed my mother’s moves and habits while considering my own options. Over the years, she continued to beat me in both games, but the contests became more competitive and my losses more narrow. Finally, at twelve, I won for the first time, at Rummikub no less, a game at which she claimed to be undefeated! I felt an overwhelming sense of pride, which was only magnified when I saw the same emotion in my mother’s face. I learned so much from these games beyond the obvious. I learned how to lose, and win, graciously. I learned to enjoy the process, regardless of the outcome. I learned how to take cues from other people but think on my own, both creatively and strategically. I learned how to cope with failure and turn it into a lesson. I learned that true victory stems from hard work and persistence. And I learned that the strongest and most meaningful relationships are not based on indulgence but on honesty and respect. This doesn’t mean that losses don’t sting. I was devastated when my hockey team lost the championship game by only one goal when I was the last one to control the puck. But I was still incredibly proud of my team’s cohesiveness, the fluid effort we put into the season, and my own contribution. More importantly, the camaraderie and support of my teammates is ongoing and something I will always cherish more than a win. I didn’t dwell over what could have been. Instead, I focused on what I was going to take with me into the next season. This past summer, I had my first substantive work experience interning at the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research, researching and writing about treatments and therapies. Working there was certainly not a game, but my strategy was the same: work hard, remain focused, be mindful and respectful of those around me, deal with the inevitable curveballs, and take constructive criticism to heart, all in pursuit of a meaningful goal. At first, I found it intimidating, but I quickly found my footing. I worked hard, knowing that what I took away from the experience would be measured by what I put into it. I studied my co-workers: how they conducted themselves, how they interacted with each other, and how they approached their respective jobs. I carefully reviewed redlines on my writing assignments, tried not to get discouraged, and responded to the comments to present the material more effectively. I absorbed the stories relayed by Parkinson’s patients regarding their struggles and was amazed at how empowered they felt by their participation in clinical trials. Through them, I discovered what it really means to fight to win. I have also come to understand that sometimes a game never ends but transforms, causing goals to shift that may require an adjustment in strategy. My mother and I still regularly play games, and we play to win. However, the match is now more balanced and I’ve noticed my mother paying much more attention to my moves and habits and even learning a few things from me.",1,2.263352806,2.711096215,2.999426484,3.320710093,2.823674947,10.8,14.6,21.0,22.4,18.0
C0,258,"Growing up, I was always drawn to board games. From the strategy and critical thinking required to the bonding and social aspects, board games have always held a special place in my heart. However, as I entered high school, I began to realize that board games were not just a way to pass the time with friends and family, but they also held valuable life lessons. One of the most important lessons that board games taught me is the importance of adapting to change. In the game of Monopoly, for example, players start out with a set amount of money and properties. However, as the game progresses, players are forced to adapt to a constantly changing board and economy. Similarly, in life, we are often faced with unexpected changes and challenges. It is not enough to simply plan and prepare for the future; we must also learn to adapt and be flexible in order to thrive. Another important lesson that board games have taught me is the value of teamwork. In the game of Settlers of Catan, for instance, players must work together to establish trade routes and build a thriving economy. This requires cooperation, communication, and trust. Similarly, in life, success often requires the ability to collaborate with others and work towards a common goal. Perhaps one of the most valuable lessons that I have learned from board games is the importance of perseverance. In the game of Risk, for instance, players must often face setbacks and defeat before ultimately achieving victory. Similarly, in life, success is rarely a smooth and easy road. There are often obstacles and challenges along the way, but it is the ability to persevere and overcome these challenges that ultimately leads to success. In addition to these more general life lessons, board games have also taught me important skills such as decision-making, critical thinking, and problem-solving. In games like Chess and Stratego, players must carefully consider each move and anticipate their opponent’s strategy. In games like Clue and Mystery Date, players must use deductive reasoning to solve complex puzzles. These skills are not only useful in board games, but also in real life situations such as decision-making in the workplace or problem-solving in personal relationships. While board games may seem like a frivolous pastime, they actually offer a myriad of important life lessons and skills. For me, board games have been a source of fun and entertainment, but they have also been a valuable tool for personal growth and development. One of my favorite board games growing up was Scrabble, which taught me the importance of language and communication. In Scrabble, players must use their vocabulary and language skills in order to create words and score points. This requires not only the ability to spell and define words, but also the ability to communicate effectively with others. Another game that has taught me important life lessons is the game of Life. In this game, players travel through a simulated life, facing challenges and opportunities along the way. This game has taught me the value of planning for the future, as well as the unpredictability of life. It has also taught me that success is not just about achieving material wealth, but about finding happiness and fulfillment. As I prepare to leave high school and enter college, I am grateful for the many life lessons that board games have taught me. Whether it is the importance of adapting to change, the value of teamwork, or the power of perseverance, these lessons and skills will undoubtedly serve me well in college and beyond. In conclusion, board games have played an important role in my personal development and growth. They have taught me valuable life lessons such as adapting to change, working as a team, and persevering through obstacles. They have also taught me important skills such as decision-making, critical thinking, and problem-solving. As I enter this next chapter of my life, I am confident that these lessons and skills will serve me well in achieving my goals and finding happiness and fulfillment.",0,2.761864135,2.845554885,2.981858285,3.207215805,2.888432627,14.8,18.0,20.0,24.2,19.0
C1,259,"Growing up, I have always been interested in games, specifically board games. Besides being able to have fun with friends and family, I gradually came to the realization that board games have taught me several valuable life lessons. One of the most important things I have learned from playing board games is the impact of communication and teamwork. When playing games like Settlers of Catan and Risk, players need to communicate with others and collaborate as a team to achieve their objectives. This has taught me that teamwork is crucial in achieving success in any aspect of life. Through playing these games, I also learnt that good communication is fundamental to success. The right approach to acquiring knowledge and working with others around us, enables us to advance in all areas of life, and communicate better. Another critical life lesson I have learned, is the importance of strategy and adaptation. In games such as Monopoly and Clue, players are often required to continually adapt to unexpected changes and challenges. This requires strategy and a clarity of thought, such that unexpected events could be handled with ease. In life, just like in games, we are often faced with unpredictable and difficult circumstances. It is only when we have an adaptable strategy, and we are agile, that we can navigate the challenges successfully. Board games have also taught me that persistence is key in achieving success. Games like Risk require players to keep playing through setbacks and losses, with the hope of ultimately achieving success. This aspect of board games is particularly useful in life, where one must keep pushing through setbacks and failures until they reach their desired goals. One must never lose sight of their objectives, and always strive to achieve the best possible outcome. To add to the above, board games offer essential life skills such as decision-making, problem solving and critical thinking. Games like Scrabble require strong vocabulary and language skills. These skills are fundamental in influencing our verbal exchange and our ability to articulate our ideas with others effectively, especially in diverse social contexts. Lastly, games like Mystery Date and Clue require players to think creatively and critically, to devise successful plans and solve complex puzzles. Such skills are relevant in real-life work scenarios where we may have to contend with complex situations and environmental changes. All these life lessons represented in board games have contributed to the person I am today. Be it in academics, relationships or work, I know that I can employ these life lessons, and my proficiency in board games to achieve any goals I have in mind. As I progress into college, I am also aware of the importance of finding balance between work and play. While academics are vital, work-life balance is essential in maintaining one's growth and keeping the motivation to learn. Board games can be a great way to unwind, have fun, and perhaps even sharpen some of the skills that were mentioned above. In conclusion, board games represent a meaningful part of my life. Through these games, I have learned several critical life lessons, including teamwork, strategy, persistence, decision-making, critical thinking and problem-solving. I appreciate the importance of working with others and communicating effectively, adapting to unexpected changes and strategically planning towards achieving set objectives. My time spent playing board games has been a great medium to learn, grow and develop vital skills that have found relevance in my academic, personal and professional life.",0,2.640653123,2.780997454,2.955012106,3.229936247,2.905704303,14.8,18.6,20.0,24.0,19.0
C2,260,"As I reflect on my board game journey, memories of playing Risk with my siblings come to mind. I can still recall the sounds of the dice rolling on the dining table's wooden surface as the three of us strategized to conquer the world. Our shouts of excitement and frustration filled the air, and the smell of freshly baked cookies wafted around us. I remember how we would pull all-nighters, taking turns to watch our territories, and pushing through the discomfort of exhaustion. More recently, I have been playing Settlers of Catan with a group of friends. The wooden pieces and colorful cards still amaze me. The feel of the clay roads and sheep cards ground me in the game, and I love the sense of building a community with my friends. During one intense game, I could feel my heart pumping as my friend and I bartered resources for the rarest of cards- the almighty knight card. I won the game, but only just. That epic game taught me that even though one may be down to their last resources, if they strategize and work hard, they can still thrive. On one particular occasion, I played Cluedo with my cousins in my grandmother's living room. It was a hot summer's day, and the doors and windows were open, letting in the humid air. In the game, we would move around the board, theorizing about who we thought the murderer was. Our voices echoed off the high ceiling, and I could see sweat on my cousins' foreheads. When my younger cousin solved the case, the room erupted in cheers and laughter, and we celebrated with ice-cold lemonade. Though these specific memories may seem insignificant, they are what have made my board game journey so meaningful. I am reminded of the importance of connection and community in my life. Games like Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Cluedo have brought my family and friends together, teaching us how to work together, strategize, adapt and persevere through challenges. I think that everyone can benefit from the lessons board games teach us. For example, in the game of Chess, the different pieces have different roles and work together to progress towards the goal of winning. Similarly, in life, we should acknowledge the diverse talents and experiences of those around us to promote teamwork and ensure collective success. In the game of Jenga, every player has a role in ensuring that the structure stays upright. In life, we have to decide if we are going to be a supporting factor or a detractor. Are we going to hold others up, or are we going to bring them down? In summary, playing board games has taught me several critical life lessons that will continue to be relevant and essential in all aspects of my life. Through games like Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Cluedo, I have learned about teamwork, adaptability, persistence, critical thinking, decision-making, and problem-solving. I have learned how to communicate effectively, build lasting friendships, and create exciting memories. These vital skills have carried over into my academic and personal life, and I am confident that they will serve me well in my future endeavors. I feel as though playing board games has allowed me to push myself to my limits, teaching me to think strategically and creatively, and provided valuable insights into the workings of my inner self. It has filled my life with laughter, friendly competition, and moments that I'll cherish for a lifetime. I appreciate board games' role in shaping who I am today, and I will always hold fondly to the memories and experiences they have brought me.",0,2.62496868,2.908691852,3.060450899,3.296908204,3.004141126,15.0,18.0,20.0,26.0,18.0
H,261,"The sound was loud and discordant, like a hurricane, high notes and low notes mixing together in an audible mess. It was as if a thousand booming foghorns were in a shouting match with sirens. Unlike me, this was a little abrasive and loud. I liked it. It was completely unexpected and extremely fun to play. Some instruments are built to make multiple notes, like a piano. A saxophone on the other hand doesn’t play chords but single notes through one vibrating reed. However, I discovered that you can play multiple notes simultaneously on the saxophone. While practicing a concert D-flat scale, I messed up a fingering for a low B-flat, and my instrument produced a strange noise with two notes. My band teacher got very excited and exclaimed, “Hey, you just played a polyphonic note!” I like it when accidents lead to discovering new ideas. I like this polyphonic sound because it reminds me of myself: many things at once. You assume one thing and get another. At school, I am a course scholar in English, but I am also able to amuse others when I come up with wince evoking puns. My math and science teachers expect me to go into engineering, but I’m more excited about making films. Discussing current events with my friends is fun, but I also like to share with them my secrets to cooking a good scotch egg. Even though my last name gives them a hint, the Asian students at our school don’t believe that I’m half Japanese. Meanwhile the non-Asians are surprised that I’m also part Welsh. I feel comfortable being unique or thinking differently. As a Student Ambassador this enables me to help freshman and others who are new to our school feel welcome and accepted. I help the new students know that it’s okay to be themselves. There is added value in mixing things together. I realized this when my brother and I won an international Kavli Science Foundation contest where we explained the math behind the Pixar movie “Up”. Using stop motion animation we explored the plausibility and science behind lifting a house with helium balloons. I like offering a new view and expanding the way people see things. In many of my videos I combine art with education. I want to continue making films that not only entertain, but also make you think. A lot of people have a single passion that defines them or have a natural talent for something specific. Like my saxophone I am an instrument, but I can play many notes at once. I’m a scholar and a musician. Quiet but talkative. An athlete and a filmmaker. Careful but spontaneous. A fan of Johnny Cash and Kill The Noise. Hard working but playful. A martial artist and a baker. One of a kind but an identical twin. Will polyphonic notes resonate in college? Yes. For instance, balancing a creative narrative with scientific facts will make a more believable story. I want to bring together different kinds of students (such as music, film, and English majors) to create more meaningful art. Understanding fellow students’ perspective, talents, and ideas are what build a great community. I’m looking forward to discovering my place in the world by combining various interests. Who I am doesn’t always harmonize and may seem like nothing but noise to some. But what I play, no matter how discordant, can be beautiful. It’s my own unique polyphonic note.",1,2.035500477,2.387157431,2.760368505,3.015226891,2.559765357,6.0,10.0,15.0,19.2,13.0
C0,262,"Music has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. As a child, I was introduced to classical music through my parents' love for it, but as I grew older, I started to explore other genres. From pop to hip-hop to indie, each type of music allowed me to uncover different facets of my identity. At first, I was hesitant to explore beyond classical music. I felt a deep loyalty to the genre, convinced it was the only type of music that could be truly intellectual. But as I started listening to more popular music, I realized how much more there was to the world of music. I loved the catchy hooks and repetitive beats that made pop music so addicting, and the raw emotion conveyed through the lyrics of hip hop songs. With each new artist and genre that I discovered, I felt like I was uncovering a new aspect of myself. When I listened to fun pop songs, I felt carefree and happy. When I listened to angry rap songs, I felt empowered and strong. And when I listened to introspective indie songs, I felt pensive and reflective. But it wasn't until I started playing music myself that I truly felt like I was gaining a deeper understanding of my multifaceted identity. I had always admired musicians, but didn't think I had any musical talent myself. Yet when I tried playing the guitar for the first time, I found that I had a natural knack for it. It was like a whole new world was opened up to me - I could now create music that was uniquely mine. As I learned to play more songs, I realized that each one allowed me to express a different part of myself. The happy chords of a pop song let me channel my carefree side, while the aggressive riffs of a rock song allowed me to tap into my anger. Even the simple fingerpicking of an acoustic ballad could bring out my rawest emotions. But it wasn't just my emotions that were being expressed through my music. As someone who straddles two cultures - my dad is from Singapore, while my mom is from the United States - I've often felt caught between two worlds. But when I started incorporating different cultural influences into my music, I found that I could create something that was uniquely my own. By blending the scales and rhythms of traditional Chinese music with the chord progressions of Western pop, I was able to bring together two seemingly disparate parts of my identity. Playing music has allowed me to explore all the different sides of myself - the joyful, the angry, the pensive, and the cultural. But it's also helped me realize that these different facets of my identity don't have to be at odds with each other. In fact, it's the combination of all these different parts that makes me who I am. That's why, when I went to Singapore to visit my dad's side of the family, I was eager to dive into the local music scene. I was blown away by how different the music was from what I was used to hearing in the United States - the scales and rhythms were unlike anything I had ever heard before. But as I listened more closely, I realized that there were also familiar elements - the catchy hooks and emotional lyrics that pervade pop music were present even in the most traditional of songs. As I watched local musicians play, I felt like I was seeing a reflection of myself - someone who is both Chinese and American, who loves both pop and traditional music, who is both joyful and pensive. And it was then that I realized that my multifaceted identity wasn't something to be ashamed of - it was something to celebrate. Music has allowed me to explore all the different parts of myself - as a musician, as someone caught between two cultures, and as a human being with a range of emotions. Through playing and listening to music, I've realized that all these different sides of me can coexist and even complement each other. It's this realization that has allowed me to feel more confident in my identity, both as a musician and as a person. As I prepare to go to college, I hope to continue exploring my multifaceted identity through music. Whether I'm playing guitar in my dorm room or attending concerts with newfound friends, I know that music will allow me to continue discovering new parts of myself. And while Yale or Harvard may seem like vastly different worlds from the suburbs of Colorado that I call home, I'm excited to see how music will help me bridge the gap between these cultures and forge new connections.",0,2.607760685,2.826219502,2.914172783,3.329598209,2.840115735,15.0,21.0,23.0,28.0,22.0

C2,264,"As the bell signals the end of my English class, I pack my things and head to the school's auditorium. A smirk forms on my face as I think about the reaction I'm likely to face from my peers regarding my after-school activities. Smiling aptly, I stroll towards my next adventure, a rendezvous with likeminded individuals who are obsessed with exploring an imaginary world. I stride to the corner of the auditorium where our school's tabletop gaming club is held, and open the door. I watch as people roll dice and trade verbal barbs all across the room, and can't help but breathe in the aura of acceptance that is palpable. The table in the back corner is my usual spot. I can quickly unfurl my campaign notes and get started, plunging my friends and I into the imaginary world of my creation. The sounds of dice rolling, character sketches, and the occasional laughter from a successful joke fill my ears, and it's music to my ears. This is no longer an experience where I feel like the odd one out with interests that others don't understand. Instead, it's a safe haven where we embrace our uniqueness without judgment. As I build up the game's theme and map, I think back on the many ways being a part of this club has transformed my life. I realize that my interests, which once felt like a liability, have become my strength. With age, I've realized the importance of embracing my individuality, my passions, and my values. I no longer feel out of place because I'm part of a club that has come to represent with both its branding and its culture- a celebration of the unconventional. As they say, individuality is the hallmark of genius, and I couldn't agree more. Just as tabletop gaming has transformed my life, music has added breadth to my existence. I'm listening to an indie band as I sit in the school library, and I often wonder why I enjoy songs and bands that others have never heard of. As the music hits my ears, the beats, the melody, the lyrics- all come together to create a perfect harmony of sounds that feels like art to me. I close my eyes, and I'm transported to a world where I'm understood, accepted, and celebrated for my uniqueness. Over the years, my eclectic taste in music has been my biggest cheerleader, urging me to embrace my individuality without trying to plug into the norms of society. With each new song, my sense of self is renewed, pulling me deeper towards the mysteries of the world. Music and games have done wonders for me, but I would be remiss if I didn't mention how this has been particularly uplifting as an immigrant. As a first-generation Filipino immigrant, I've encountered many difficulties, including not being able to identify myself fully with any one culture. There's a lot of confusion in my mind connected to my culture, but I also understand the importance of celebrating my heritage more and more each day. As I dance to the beat of the drums at the local Filipino festival, or listen to a beloved Filipino singer, I feel an intense connection to the culture of my birth, one that I'm elated to showcase. In retrospect, I've come to realize that my passion for music, gaming, and my culture are instrumental in my life and development. Embracing my individuality and standing up for what I believe in has taught me valuable skills, such as storytelling, critical thinking, and problem-solving. I realize how important unique interests are to drawing us towards commonalities with people we wouldn't ordinarily associate with. These skills have been invaluable to me both inside and outside of the classroom. Being unique isn't just about showcasing our differences; it's about creating a better, more diverse world. As I prepare myself to head off to college, there's no doubt that I'm taking my love for games, music, and culture with me. I'm excited to immerse myself in the diverse environment that a campus presents and find even more opportunities to explore my interests, combine domains, and create change. Once there, I'll be able to explore more widely and with more depth towards combining music, film, and the written word in the most significant ways possible. In conclusion, through my passions for gaming, music, and culture, I have learned that individuality is a beautiful force to be reckoned with. Our diversity is what brings us all together, all across the world. As a culture, we need to embrace our uniqueness and respect its worth because, in the long run, this is the key towards both societal development and individual happiness. By showing the world our uniqueness, we are telling it our stories in the most compassionate manner possible hence developing a more diverse, tolerant, and beautiful world.",0,2.771315329,3.035759204,3.167546836,3.262593948,3.108897095,15.2,20.4,23.6,27.0,22.0
H,265,"For as long as I can remember, one of my favorite pastimes has been manipulating those tricky permutations of 26 letters to fill in that signature, bright green gridded board of Wheel of Fortune. Every evening at precisely 6:30 p.m., my family and I unfailingly gather in our living room in anticipation of Pat Sajak’s cheerful announcement: “It’s time to spin the wheel!” And the game is afoot, our banter punctuated by the potential of either big rewards or even bigger bankruptcies: “She has to know that word—my goodness, why is she buying a vowel?!” While a game like Wheel of Fortune is full of financial pitfalls, I wasn’t ever much interested in the money or new cars to be won. I found myself drawn to the letters and playful application of the English alphabet, the intricate units of language. For instance, phrases like “I love you,” whose incredible emotion is quantized to a mere set of eight letters, never cease to amaze me. Whether it’s the definitive pang of a simple “I am” or an existential crisis posed by “Am I”, I recognized at a young age how letters and their order impact language. Spelling bees were always my forte. I’ve always been able to visualize words and then verbally string individual consonants and vowels together. I may not have known the meaning of every word I spelled, I knew that soliloquy always pushed my buttons: that -quy ending was so bizarre yet memorable! And intaglio with its silent “g” just rolled off the tongue like cultured butter. Eventually, letters assembled into greater and more complex words. I was an avid reader early on, devouring book after book. From the Magic Treehouse series to the too real 1984, the distressing The Bell Jar, and Tagore’s quaint short stories, I accumulated an ocean of new words, some real (epitome, effervescence, apricity), and others fully fictitious (doubleplusgood), and collected all my favorites in a little journal, my Panoply of Words. Add the fact that I was raised in a Bengali household and studied Spanish in high school for four years, and I was able to add other exotic words. Sinfin, zanahoria, katukutu, and churanto soon took their rightful places alongside my English favorites. And yet, during this time of vocabulary enrichment, I never thought that Honors English and Biology had much in common. Imagine my surprise one night as a freshman as I was nonchalantly flipping through a science textbook. I came upon fascinating new terms: adiabatic, axiom, cotyledon, phalanges…and I couldn’t help but wonder why these non-literary, seemingly random words were drawing me in. These words had sharp syllables, were challenging to enunciate, and didn’t possess any particularly abstract meaning. I was flummoxed, but curious…I kept reading. “Air in engine quickly compressing…” “Incontestable mathematical truth…” “Fledgling leaf in an angiosperm…” “Ossified bones of fingers and toes… …and then it hit me. For all my interest in STEM classes, I never fully embraced the beauty of technical language, that words have the power to simultaneously communicate infinite ideas and sensations AND intricate relationships and complex processes. Perhaps that’s why my love of words has led me to a calling in science, an opportunity to better understand the parts that allow the world to function. At day’s end, it’s language that is perhaps the most important tool in scientific education, enabling us all to communicate new findings in a comprehensible manner, whether it be focused on minute atoms or vast galaxies. It’s equal parts humbling and enthralling to think that I, Romila, might still have something to add to that scientific glossary, a little permutation of my own that may transcend some aspect of human understanding. Who knows, but I’m definitely game to give the wheel a spin, Pat, and see where it takes me…",1,2.763197244,3.025838492,3.255670721,3.423734178,3.125707002,14.0,19.0,27.0,34.0,24.0
C0,266,"As a high school senior, I have developed a deep love for words and science. At first, these two seemingly disparate fields seemed to have little in common. However, as I delved deeper into each subject, I began to realize how inherently intertwined they are. The scientific method and language both offer a way to explain the world and its inner workings. As a child, I was a voracious reader, often getting lost in fantastical stories or scientific discoveries. I loved the way words could make the impossible believable, and how science could explain the mysteries of the universe. Eventually, I found myself drawn to science fiction, which combined my love of words and science into fantastical tales of the unknown. I marveled at the way authors could create complex and intricate worlds and species, all adhering to the laws of science. As I grew up, my curiosity about the natural world only intensified. I found myself drawn to the sciences, particularly biology and chemistry. In these subjects, I discovered a new way to explore the world around me. Through experiments and research, I could gain a greater understanding of the intricacies of the living and non-living things that make up our world. Additionally, the methodical approach that science requires appealed to me as someone who loves structure and order. However, I soon discovered that the scientific process is not just about conducting experiments and drawing conclusions. Writing and language are integral to science as well. From lab reports to research papers, scientists must be skilled writers in order to convey their findings accurately and effectively. In my own experience, writing lab reports has taught me the importance of clarity and precision. Much like writing fiction, every detail must be carefully crafted to ensure a complete and accurate story is told. My love of words and science has led me to pursue unique opportunities that bridge both fields. As a member of the school’s Science Olympiad team, I have had the chance to write technical papers and reports on topics ranging from insect anatomy to environmental science. These assignments have allowed me to learn about scientific topics in depth, while also honing my writing skills. Outside of school, I have also taken creative writing classes to further develop my ability to craft compelling stories and characters. Through my experiences, I have come to see that science is not just a series of facts to memorize, but a constantly evolving field that requires creativity, imagination, and a certain amount of artistry. Science, like writing, is about exploration and discovery. It’s the pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the world around us. As Carl Sagan once said, “Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.” I believe that science and writing both offer a way to connect with something greater than ourselves, something that can help us better understand who we are and our place in the world. This is the perspective and passion that I intend to bring with me to college. As someone who loves words and science, I am excited to continue exploring the intersection between these two fields, and to discover new ways in which they can complement each other. At Yale or Harvard, I know I would find the resources and opportunities necessary to pursue such a unique path. Furthermore, I believe that my appreciation for both the artistry of language and the rigor of science would make me an asset to any academic community. My ability to write clear and concise reports, while maintaining a sense of narrative, is a trait that I am confident would serve me well in any academic or research setting. Additionally, my attention to detail and willingness to dive deep into complex subjects are skills that are crucial to success in both writing and science. In conclusion, my love of words and science has given me a unique perspective on the world and my place in it. These fields may seem vastly different at first glance, but upon closer inspection, they complement each other in surprising ways. I am excited to continue exploring this intersection, and to use my skills and passions to make meaningful contributions to whichever academic community I eventually join.

C1,267,"As a high school senior who has developed a deep love for both language and science, I am excited to pursue an undergraduate program that will allow me to further explore these two fields. My passion for words was first ignited through my love for word games and spelling bees, and over time, I have come to appreciate the beauty of language and the power of words to communicate complex ideas and emotions. In particular, I am fascinated by how letters, when arranged in certain ways, can create words that are greater than the sum of their parts. Reading books from a variety of genres and in different languages has allowed me to appreciate the depth and complexity of language, and has also given me insight into the different ways in which language can be used to convey meaning and evoke emotion. Through writing and creative expression, I have learned how to harness the power of language to tell compelling stories, communicate research findings, and inspire others. My love for science, on the other hand, was sparked by a curiosity about the natural world and a desire to understand the complexities of the universe. Studying biology and chemistry has allowed me to explore the intricacies of the living and non-living things that make up our world, and to understand how they function and interact with one another. Through laboratory experiments and research projects, I have gained practical experience in applying scientific concepts to solve real-world problems, and have learned to appreciate the creativity and innovation that are required to make new discoveries in the field of science. What excites me most about both language and science is their potential to transform the world and address some of the greatest challenges that we face as a society. As a future college student, I hope to explore ways in which these two fields can be integrated to drive innovation and create positive social change.

C2,268,"The sound of the turning page was one of the most satisfying things I could hear. I would immerse myself in the world of characters, letting myself be carried away by the ebb and flow of the narrative. Books were my refuge, my escape from reality. But they were also my pathway to knowledge and to a love of language. I remember vividly the first time I read J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. The rustling of the pages as I turned them, the scent of the ink on the paper, the feel of the thick hardcovers in my hands—it all contributed to the immersive experience of the wizarding world. The vivid descriptions of the characters, the spells and enchantments, and the storied Hogwarts castle itself brought the magic alive in my mind. Rowling's clever use of words conveyed the vivid imagery of the wizarding world so perfectly that it ignited my own imagination. In college, I pursued my passion for literature by participating in writing workshops and literature classes. In my memoir workshop, my classmates and I shared our own deeply personal experiences and slowly honed in on our own unique writing style. Each week, we would provide feedback to each other, exchanging knowledge and learning from each other's strengths and mistakes. The sounds of scribbled notes and exchanged laughter in the workshops were amplified by the sight of brightly colored pens and coffee stains on crinkled pages. While studying in Paris, I had the chance to enhance my French skills by studying at Sorbonne. What started as a meek attempt to speak a new language quickly became an insatiable desire to learn more. The floral perfume in the breeze, the chatter amongst students in the cobblestone streets became the foundation on which I learned how to read, write, and eventually converse in another tongue. In many ways, language is the bedrock of human civilization. We use language to share ideas, express emotions, and connect with one another. A nuanced message can be lost without the right language, the right tone, and the right inflection. Language brings people together, even when understanding is not easily attainable. In a world where language barriers can sometimes cause fractures, we must find ways to connect through the power of words. I hope to use my passion for language to bridge divides between nations and cultures. Whether through my own writing or by learning new languages, I strive to connect with people from all walks of life. Conversations on the streets of Paris with the locals taught me that understanding a language helped me to understand more about French culture and beyond. Words opened doors I never thought possible. In the end, my love of language is more than a simple hobby. It is woven into the fabric of my life, connecting me to the wider world and inspiring me to understand it more deeply. And as I move forward into the future, I am excited to see where this love of language will take me, what new experiences and opportunities it will open up, and what new connections it will help me create. As I turn the last page of a novel, and a final smooth sound shears the gloss off the paper, I am thankful for the invaluable gift of language that enables us to connect in a world that keeps evolving.",0,2.441096972,2.805098509,3.212848953,3.457268493,2.884374254,13.0,16.8,21.0,24.6,19.0
H,269,"“No, no, no, you’re all doing it wrong! The secret to developing realistic drawings lies in your ability to study every nuance of the object in front of you,” my art teacher advised. “Try sketching with one eye closed; it’s all about perspective, people!” My classmates accepted his advice and I watched as they attempted to make sense of the lifeless apples and pears that lay on the desk in front of them. I, too, clamped my left eye shut, pretending that this technique altered my view in the same manner it affected my peers. It didn’t. With one eye closed, my fruit appeared precisely the same as it had with both eyes open. As a result of a Retinoblastoma diagnosis at two years old, my world, which my parents dotingly refer to as “Jillian’s world,” has always appeared slightly different from that of others. I have no recollection of having binocular vision, so depth perception has always been a non-existent ability. For the majority of my childhood, I felt ashamed by my prosthetic eye, purposely pushing my hair toward the left side of my face and avoiding all eye contact that surpassed ten seconds. I hated that my eyes did not appear the same, and constantly worried how others would perceive my abnormality. It was not until last summer, when I received a government scholarship to study Hindi in India, that my perspective regarding “Jillian’s world” was altered by one unlikely symbol: the swastika. I encountered it upon entering my host-family’s home for the first time. It was plastered directly on top of their front doorstep in between two mosaic footprints. I had seen the swastika millions of times in history books and documentaries, but blatantly confronting it in person was an entirely different story. My heart started to sting as images of skeletal bodies and families torn apart raced through my head. The swastika was the face of the bigotry and discrimination that I strongly denounced. I could not wrap my head around the fact that I was about to spend my summer with people who displayed a hate symbol in front of their home. Within a matter of days I discovered that my host-family was the complete antithesis of the negative characteristics I had originally associated with the swastika. They took me to lavish weddings and temples and taught me how to cook Indian cuisine. My host-mom showed me traditional techniques to create art and we shared many laughs at my many failed attempts at bargaining with market shopkeepers in Hindi. By the mid-way point in my program I had fallen in love with my host-family and their vibrant culture. It was then that I realized that I needed to take another look at the swastika through my host-family’s lens. One afternoon, I asked my host-mom what the symbol meant in her culture, informing her that it was an infamous hate symbol in the United States. Her response is forever ingrained in my memory. With wide eyes and a furrowed brow, she answered, “A hate symbol? No no, we believe the swastik is a symbol for peace and good fortune. Why is it hateful?” When I mentioned the Holocaust, she appeared even more confused. After further researching the symbol, I found that the swastika, known as the swastik in Hindi, had been a Hindu symbol of peace thousands of years before it was ever a symbol of evil. We sat across from each other, both amazed at how our views of one symbol could oppose one another, yet be equally valid in their own respect; this was the beauty of perspective. Since returning from India, I now push my hair away from my face with headbands and my fear of sustained eye contact has vanished. My disability does not limit “Jillian’s world,” but rather, gives me the ability to see far and wide, apples and pears included.",1,2.681102983,2.887182226,3.135189435,3.445091359,3.094110665,14.0,18.0,24.0,29.0,20.0
C0,270,"When I was eight years old, my father gave me a necklace that had been passed down through his family for generations. It was a small, gold locket with intricate engravings on the front, and inside there was a tiny photograph of my great-great-grandmother, whom I had never met. As a child, I wore it occasionally and thought it was a pretty trinket, but I didn't fully appreciate its significance until much later. As I got older, I began to understand the weight of family history and the value of tangible reminders of those who came before us. My great-great-grandmother, I learned, was an immigrant who came to the United States from Poland in the early 1900s, fleeing persecution and seeking a better life for her family. She worked tirelessly to provide for them, and her resilience and determination became a source of inspiration for me. But it wasn't until I started volunteering at a local refugee center that the true meaning of the locket revealed itself. I was nervous at first, unsure of how to communicate with people who spoke different languages and came from vastly different backgrounds. But as I spent more time with the families who came to the center seeking assistance, I began to feel a sense of empathy that I had never experienced before. One day, I met a young girl who reminded me of myself at that age. Like me, she was shy and reserved, but she had a mischievous glint in her eye that hinted at an inner strength. We bonded over our shared love of books and our struggles with learning a new language. As I helped her with her homework, I noticed that she was wearing a necklace that looked remarkably similar to mine. It was made of simple, tarnished metal and seemed to have been crafted by hand. Curious, I asked her about it, and she told me that it had been given to her by her grandmother before they fled their war-torn country. It was a symbol of hope and a reminder of the love that had guided them through their journey. Suddenly, the locket around my own neck took on a new level of significance. It was not just a pretty trinket anymore; it was a tangible link between my own family's story of perseverance and the stories of countless other families who had faced similar challenges. Through my experiences at the refugee center, I began to understand the power of symbols in forging connections and building empathy. Each person who came through our doors had their own unique story, and many of them carried tangible mementos of their past that held great meaning for them. As I listened to these stories and saw the hope and resilience of the families around me, I realized that I had a responsibility to use my own privilege and resources to help create a more just and equitable world. In my own small way, I began to collect symbols of my own. I started wearing the locket more regularly, as a reminder of the sacrifices that my own ancestors had made and the obligation that I felt to honor their legacy by working towards a brighter future. I also started collecting pieces of art and jewelry made by refugees and immigrants, knowing that each one held its own story and its own message of hope and resilience. As I prepare to enter college and pursue my own path, I carry these symbols and these stories with me. I know that I am fortunate in many ways, and I am humbled by the strength and resilience of those who have faced far greater challenges than I have. But I also know that I have an opportunity to use my own experiences and resources to create positive change in the world, however small that change may be. The locket that my father gave me so long ago has become a symbol of much more than its physical form. It is a symbol of hope, perseverance, and empathy—a tangible reminder of the values that guide me and the connection that I feel to all those who have come before me and all those who continue to fight for a better future. And though it is just one small object, I know that it holds a power and a significance far beyond its size.",0,2.757046507,2.938392929,3.068121656,3.395378548,3.051606254,19.0,21.6,25.4,29.2,22.0
C1,271,"Growing up, I always knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world. As a high school student, I am keenly aware of the myriad challenges that face our society today, from climate change to social inequality to political polarization. But I also know that there are no easy solutions to these complex problems, and that effecting meaningful change requires more than just good intentions. Throughout my academic career, I have sought out opportunities to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to become an effective agent of change. Whether it was conducting research on refugee resettlement policies or organizing student-led protests against police brutality, I have always been driven by a deep sense of empathy and a commitment to stand up for what I believe is right. But it was not until I participated in a study abroad program in India that I fully recognized the power of 'small acts' to create meaningful change. During my time in India, I was struck by the enormity of the challenges facing the country: extreme poverty, rampant corruption, and a deep-seated cultural divide that seemed almost impossible to bridge. But I was also inspired by the countless individuals and organizations working tirelessly to address these problems, from small grassroots nonprofits to international NGOs to innovative social entrepreneurs. One day, as I was walking through the streets of Delhi, I saw a young boy huddled under a bridge, his clothes tattered and his face smudged with dirt. I approached him tentatively, unsure of how to communicate with him, but I soon found that a smile and a few words in Hindi were enough to break down the barriers between us. We talked for a few minutes, and as I listened to his story, I was struck by the deep sense of resilience and hope that he possessed, even in the face of overwhelming adversity. As I continued on my journey, I encountered countless other small acts of kindness and generosity that underscored the power of individual actions to effect change. From the woman who sold chai on the streets to support her family to the community activist fighting against caste discrimination to the young girl who shared her lunch with me, I was reminded time and again that even the smallest acts of compassion and understanding can make a world of difference. Since returning from India, I have carried this lesson with me in everything that I do. I have come to believe that creating meaningful change requires not just grandiose visions or sweeping policy reforms, but also small acts of kindness, compassion, and empathy that can foster connections and build understanding between disparate groups. As a high school senior applying to top-tier universities like Yale and Harvard, I know that I am part of a privileged and elite group. But I also know that I have an obligation to use my privilege and my education to effect change in the world, no matter how small that change might be. Whether it is through volunteering at a local shelter, organizing a community service project, or simply lending a listening ear to someone in need, I believe that each of us has the ability to make a difference in our own small way. In my personal essay, I hope to convey not just my academic achievements or my extracurricular activities, but also my deep-seated commitment to making a positive impact on the world. I want to highlight the small acts of kindness and empathy that have guided me throughout my journey, and I want to demonstrate how these acts can be harnessed to create meaningful, lasting change in even the most challenging of circumstances. I believe that Yale and Harvard, with their rich histories and traditions of excellence, are uniquely positioned to help me achieve my goals. Through world-class faculty, innovative research programs, and a rich and diverse student body, I know that these institutions can provide me with the knowledge, skills, and resources to make a meaningful difference in the world. And I am eager to take advantage of every opportunity that these universities have to offer, from collaborating on cutting-edge research projects to engaging with local communities to sharing my own experiences and insights with fellow students. In the end, I am reminded of the words of Mahatma Gandhi, who once said, 'Be the change that you wish to see in the world.' I believe that this sentiment captures the essence of my own journey and my own aspirations. By embodying the values of empathy, kindness, and compassion, I hope to create a ripple effect of positive change that can extend far beyond my own individual efforts. And I know that, with the support of institutions like Yale and Harvard, I can make this dream a reality.",0,3.153472099,3.388260005,3.565714144,3.770141579,3.433830436,23.4,27.0,30.0,36.6,28.0
C2,272,"As I sit down to write my college essay, I am struck by the overwhelming sense of gratitude and humility that I feel. Growing up in an affluent suburb of New York City, I have been privileged in ways that I am only now beginning to fully appreciate. I have had access to top-notch educational opportunities, supportive family and friends, and a wealth of resources that many others can only dream of. And yet, despite these advantages, I am acutely aware of the many challenges facing our society today, from economic inequality to racial injustice to environmental degradation. That is why, as a high school senior, I am more committed than ever to using my privilege and my education to make a positive impact on the world. One experience that has shaped my worldview in profound ways was my participation in a service trip to a rural village in the Dominican Republic. The contrast between the luxurious lifestyle that I am accustomed to and the poverty and hardship that I witnessed there was jarring, to say the least. As I worked alongside local residents to build homes and schools, I was struck by their resilience and determination in the face of adversity. Despite their lack of material wealth, these individuals possessed a rich sense of community and solidarity that was both humbling and inspiring. But I also realized, as I reflected on my experience, that there were limitations to what we as outsiders could achieve through these kinds of service trips. While filling a need in the short-term, these activities did little to address the root causes of poverty and inequality. And I began to recognize that, if I truly wanted to make a difference in the world, I needed to engage in more substantive and long-term efforts to effect structural change. Since then, I have immersed myself in numerous social justice initiatives, both in my local community and beyond. I have worked with local organizations to provide legal aid to low-income residents, organized student-led protests in support of Black Lives Matter, and volunteered with environmental conservation efforts. Through these activities, I have learned invaluable lessons about the complexities of social change, the importance of listening to and centering the voices of those most affected by injustice, and the power of collective action. But I have also come to recognize that there is still so much work to be done. As our society continues to grapple with the twin crises of systemic racism and climate change, it is all too easy to feel overwhelmed and powerless. And yet, I believe that it is precisely at moments like these that we must summon our courage, our compassion, and our resolve to effect meaningful change. In the end, I believe that Yale and Harvard are the ideal institutions to help me achieve my goals of making a positive impact on the world. Through their rigorous academic programs, top-tier research opportunities, and commitment to diversity and inclusion, these universities offer the resources and support that I need to continue my journey of growth and learning. I am eager to engage with fellow students and faculty members, to explore new ideas and perspectives, and to contribute to ongoing efforts to build a more just and equitable world. As I look ahead to the future, I am humbled and inspired by the knowledge that, as a young person with a passion for social justice and a commitment to making a difference in the world, I am joining a rich and vibrant tradition of activism and social change. And I am grateful for the opportunity to use my education and my privilege to make that change a reality.",0,3.100144896,3.197106656,3.330646743,3.645075064,3.251318689,22.4,25.0,27.0,30.2,26.0
H,273,"Whether we are opera singers or shower-wailers, ballet dancers or awkward shufflers, we all understand how music makes us feel, and more importantly, makes us move. Moving to music is so much a part of the human experience that it seems innate to us as a species. A recent study supports this, showing that fetuses react to music with increased motion, and in some cases, open their mouths as if to sing. Once out of the womb, this response only grows: a catchy tune makes hips swing and toes tap, and in certain situations, heads bang. The music that moves us is itself a product of movement. As a musician who is a tactile learner, I’m keenly aware of the way a piece feels as I play it. Despite years of piano teachers telling me to read the page in front of me while I play, my eyes habitually wander to my hands, where the music is really happening. This gap between reading and performing music keeps me from fully expressing my musical ideas. As a way to bridge this divide, I am trying to create a simple instrument that translates movement directly into music, using motion to capture melodic ideas and expressions. I got this idea while watching a lively orchestra conductor, who sometimes overshadowed the players so much that he seemed to be dancing alone, pulling notes through the air with his baton. Enchanted by how effortlessly he stirred the ocean of sound around him, I caught myself swishing my hands back and forth to the beat. As I lifted my arm to match the swelling tempo, I wondered: what if we could turn all kinds of movement into melodies? It occurred to me that I could apply my skills in computer science and digital media to create a movement-to music application. To a computer everything is math, including music and movement. Every note and motion can be tracked, stored, and broken down into a set of variables, based on information from an outside source, such as a computer mouse or touchpad. I am currently taking advantage of this relationship by creating a web-based application that synthesizes music based on interactions with the cursor. The program, once completed, will play notes as the mouse is pressed, with unique pitch and tone determined by the position and motion of the pointer. Eventually, I’d like to take this concept further using more sophisticated technology. I plan to take data from a motion sensor or camera and convert it directly into sound, using a simple device that tracks movement and translates its vertical position into musical pitch, its horizontal position into musical dynamics (soft to loud), and its speed into musical tone. Imagine being able to move your hand to generate a pitch that changes with the direction of movement, producing a musical phrase. Sophisticated users would be able to control relationships between variables to suit their needs; for example, they could link various components of movement (such as direction or speed in all three dimensions) to a wide range of musical characteristics, including, but not limited to, timbre, harmonics, and distortion. Ultimately, artists could use my instrument to make music from anything that moves: dancers onstage, migrating birds, traffic at a busy intersection. It would not only close the gap between the conception and realization of music, but it could open new creative pathways that combine music and motion. As for me, I look forward to performing on an empty stage, directing an invisible orchestra with the flick of my wrist.",1,2.841118432,3.114905179,3.281656788,3.471079028,3.190166055,21.0,22.0,24.8,29.4,23.5
C0,274,"As a kid, I always struggled to express myself. I lacked the words to articulate what I was feeling and the guidance to understand what I needed. I often turned to movement, whether it was dance, running, or even just bouncing my knee up and down. It wasn't until I discovered my dad's old guitar that I realized how movement could be transformed into music. At first, I struggled to learn the guitar. I couldn't keep a steady rhythm or remember all the chords. But one day it clicked. Suddenly, my movements and emotions flowed naturally into the music I was playing. I found that I could channel my energy into the sound, creating something expressive and unique. As I continued to practice, I realized that music was a vehicle for emotional expression. By undergoing physical movements, I was able to transform my emotions into sound. The more I learned about music theory, the more I realized that every piece of music is an expression of someone's feelings. I began to notice this in other art forms as well. In dance, each movement is an expression of emotion, each flurry of the arm or spin of the body tells a story. In painting, every brushstroke is a representation of the artist's thought process and emotion. Even in writing, sentence structure and word choice is a reflection of tone and emotion. This concept of turning movement into art is something that has fascinated me and inspired me to continue pursuing music. But more importantly, it has taught me the importance of emotional expression. In a world where it's easy to feel disconnected or misunderstood, it's empowering to be able to channel your emotions into something that can be understood by others. As I've played music and developed my skills over the years, I've become increasingly interested in exploring the intersection of movement and sound. I've experimented with incorporating different rhythmic patterns and body movements into my playing. I've even started exploring non-traditional instruments that rely more heavily on physical movement, like the theremin or the turntable. It's been a fun and exciting journey, but it's also taught me something profound about the nature of expression. At the end of the day, it's not about the medium, whether it's music, dance, writing, or painting. What matters is how you use that medium to express your emotions and ideas. Even something as simple as bouncing your knee can be a source of inspiration and creativity if you're willing to explore it. This lesson has also informed my approach to life outside of music. I've learned to be more vulnerable, to share my emotions with others so they can better understand me. I've also developed a greater empathy for the struggles of others, recognizing that everyone has a unique experience and perspective that should be respected. As I look ahead to college and the future beyond, I hope to continue exploring this intersection of movement and emotion. I'm interested in studying music theory and composition, as well as exploring other creative outlets like dance and painting. I believe that a comprehensive understanding of how these art forms intertwine can lead to truly groundbreaking artistic expression. More than that, though, I hope to use my passion for music to make a positive impact in the world. Music has the power to bring people together, to inspire and to heal. I want to continue exploring the ways in which this can be accomplished, whether it's through composing music that brings awareness to social issues, or using my skills as a musician to improve the lives of others. Ultimately, the lesson I've learned from turning movement into music instrument is that emotional expression is a fundamental part of being human. We all have emotions, and we all deserve to have a voice through which to express them. Whether it's through music or any other medium, it's a beautiful thing to be able to connect with others in such a profound and meaningful way.",0,2.438116265,2.68442245,2.828149017,3.004887539,2.722258379,13.0,15.8,19.0,22.0,18.0
C1,275,"Music is a powerful tool that unites people across borders, cultures, and time. It has been an integral part of my life, enabling me to create, express and connect with others on a deeper level. As I reflect on my musical journey, I realize that my relationship with music has been shaped by my passion for movement. This speculation became evident when I witnessed how I playing the piano felt, inexperienced with music theory. My eyes habitually wandered to my hands, where the music was really happening, rather than reading from the scores. Years of practice have taught me that proper movement is essential for expressing emotions through music. But this realization sparked the question: 'What if we could turn all kinds of movement into melodies?' As a computer science and digital media enthusiast with expertise in track data, I'm developing a movement-to-music application that lets users generate melodies from simple gestures such as cursor movement. I plan on taking this concept further by using more advanced technology to track motion using sensors or cameras and turn it into sound. The invention of a movement-to-music program creates limitless possibilities, and my long term goal is to provide artists with a platform that integrates music and motion. I envision people playing music during dance, migrating birds, or bustling downtown traffic through their body movements. Music encompasses the vast physical world in extraordinary ways, and my invention aims at tapping into that immense potential by bridging the gap between music theory and movement. My experience in music production has developed my creative abilities, and I am eager to learn more about music theory, composition, and how these art forms intertwine. I believe that a thorough understanding of this intersection of movement and emotion can be used to achieve groundbreaking artistic expression. I have learned that music can be used as a tool to connect and heal people in ways that go further than breaking language barriers. It brings people together and creates a sense of shared experience. As I prepare for college and endeavor beyond, I aspire to use my passion to make a positive impact in the world. Music has brought me joy and inspiration, and I hope to use that to generate awareness for social causes or improve someone's life through my musical creations. In a world where interacting with technology is commonplace, my invention can be seen as a natural evolution in the relationship between technology, art, and humanity. As a musician, I understand the importance of movement in music production and the need for easy access to music creation for individuals, regardless of their musical abilities. In conclusion, music unites people and creates something remarkable that goes beyond the realm of the senses. My invention plays a role in this by incorporating the fundamental human trait of movement to create something that unites people while also allowing them to express themselves in a unique and profound way.

C2,276,"When I first started playing the piano, I was struck by the feeling of my fingers running across the keys, producing a beautiful melody that filled the room. The sharp resonant notes of the keys made the piano feel alive - like a breathing organism that vibrated with each note played. The feeling of expression through movement had always been intriguing to me, leading me to ask the question: 'What if we could bring the movement into the music?' As an accomplished computer scientist, I took on the challenge of creating software that allowed users to generate melodies from simple gestures such as cursor movement. The program aimed to bridge the gap between music theory and movement, opening up a new world of musical expression. I drew inspiration for this program from my passion for music, and my intuition that music is not limited to the physical keys of a piano. It is a feeling, a sensation that reverberates through every pulse in our bodies, in every movement. As I continued to develop this project, I found that the program had limitless possibilities. I envisioned the creation of a new artistic medium that wrapped to people's movements, allowing them to interact with various locations, people, and organisms through new sensory experiences. With the advancements of technology, I realized that I could move beyond the simple cursor and create an instrument mapping to the human body and capturing patterns of motion to produce melodies. Looking beyond the artistic thrill of the project, I see an opportunity to build social awareness and promote change in our communities. My goal is to create a platform where artists, musicians, and common individuals can share ideas and work together to address social, moral, and economic issues faced in the world today. Music transcends culture, religion and language, creating a sense of unity, a shared experience that can connect diverse groups of people, transforming into a driving force that inspires change. Stepping into the vibrant, dynamic halls of an Ivy League University, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of learning about music theory, composition and technology. My path towards computer science and digital media has strengthened my creativity in music production, but I look forward to acquiring a deep understanding of the core principles of music and its beautiful intersection with technology. At college, I intend to join music groups, participate in performances to see how my program intersects with more traditional instruments such as the violin and the trumpet. I hope to extend my knowledge to understand and appreciate classical music, jazz, and world music.

H,277,"Instinctively, I hold my breath. The pungent fragrance of roasted coffee beans and the shrill sound of steam whistles from the espresso machines force my senses into overload. Before me are mounds of freshly-baked goodies and colossal stacks of books piled on bookshelves as high as the ceiling. Pressing my nose against the glass cover, I don’t budge until the ginormous chocolate-chip cookie is within my possession. With one hand holding my cookie, I collect as many books as my chubby arms can hold and plop into my favorite blue armchair. I would look forward to this routine: every Saturday, when the big hand hit six, my parents would take me to Timothy’s, their coffee shop, and I would begin the day’s quest. To my childhood self, Timothy’s was my bridge to Terabithia. In this world, I’ve been a resident of Dr. Seuss’s topsy-turvy Thneedville; an acrobat, weaving words into webs with Charlotte; and a palace spy in Wonderland, fighting for my life in a game of flamingo croquet. Braving these adventures instilled in me a sense of invincibility that pushed me to tackle new experiences, even engaging in mischievous absurdities, both in this world and reality. Draping myself in jewelry constructed out of straws and cup sleeves, I would unabashedly strut all around the café. Expressions of this unwavering self-confidence and sense of invincibility were not solely limited to my sense of fashion, but rather, it was ingrained in every thought and action that I had. I believed that Timothy’s should’ve been called Anna-Banana’s, that the blue armchair was my throne, and that the deliveryman’s dolly was my royal carriage. Ignorant to the laws of gravity, I once jumped off the dolly after reaching peak acceleration, wholeheartedly believing that I could fly. With a bruised ego and scraped knees, I learned a valuable lesson: invincibility is a mere delusion. I realized that Timothy’s was never a world constructed solely for me, at least in the way I had imagined. There were no adoring crowds, and the blue armchair wasn’t mine. While I had imagined glorious adventures, in reality, my family’s livelihood depended on the success of this café. Moving to Canada without any support, my educated parents relinquished their professional aspirations to build a stable business to provide for me. Awareness of my parents’ sacrifices for my success imbued my understanding of the interdependency of people, their successes, and their failures, providing me with a new lens to construct my understanding of the world. Shifting from being front and center to an observant spectator, I began to see beyond myself, picking up the art of people-watching. As if placing an invisibility cloak on, I would quietly sink into the blue armchair, discreetly watching peoples’ behavior and interactions with one another. I found myself creating whimsical backstories of circumstance for each passerby, intertwining chance encounters and meaningful exchanges. People-watching not only helped me to become more aware of those around me, was also as an opportunity to explore undiscovered parts of myself. I learned that despite the many sports that I have experimented with, I am the MVP at bench-warming. I make a mean latte, often topping my creations with adorable foam cats. I adore Broadway musicals and am always ready to showcase my dancing at a flash mob. I passionately believe in advocating for human rights, actively engaging in Amnesty International’s initiatives. And, I discovered that I am not only an advocate for but also identify with the LGBTQ+ community. To say that I have figured out all of who I am would be a lie. Unlike the world of fantasy, there is no single defining moment – no Excalibur, no Sorting Hat – that marks my complete evolution. My niche in the world constantly changes, but what remains steadfast is my commitment to a life of service and adventure, albeit it isn’t as cozy as the blue armchair.",1,2.932589249,3.181888384,3.326642246,3.500936331,3.242815786,16.0,19.0,22.0,24.0,20.0
C0,278,"As a child, my family frequently visited a cozy café in our small town. It had a warm atmosphere with mismatched furniture, dim lighting, and chalkboard menus that advertised tasty treats. It quickly became a familiar and beloved spot for us. But to me, this café was more than just a place for coffee and pastries. It was the setting for many of my childhood adventures. One summer, my parents decided to let me walk to the café alone for the first time. I was thrilled at the prospect of being responsible for myself, but also nervous about the possibility of getting lost. Armed with a small amount of pocket money, I set out on the fifteen-minute journey. The sun was shining, and there was anticipation building inside me as I walked the familiar path that led to the café. When I arrived, I felt a sense of pride at having made the journey on my own. The barista, Kate, greeted me with a smile and acted as if she had been waiting for me. She suggested the homemade lemonade and convinced me to try it with a chocolate croissant. I eagerly handed over my money, feeling grown-up as I made a decision about what to order. Sipping my refreshment, I felt content and free, with no one to tell me what to do or where to go next. This visit soon became a part of a weekly routine, and I relished the independence that came with it. Each time, I'd be greeted by Kate and surrounded by the sweet and calming scent of coffee beans. But one day, my usual routine was interrupted when the head barista, Julia, suggested that I try out the cookie-decorating class they held for children on Sunday mornings. I hesitated at first, as I was never a fan of sharing, but eventually, I agreed to give it a try. The class was held in a small room at the back of the café, filled with children my age, each one wearing an apron and smiling ear-to-ear with excitement. We were given a variety of toppings and colorful frostings to decorate our cookies with, and I immediately set to work, meticulously designing each one. The entire room was filled with the sound of children laughing and chatting, and I felt a kinship with each one of them. From that day forward, Sundays would become my favorite day of the week; a day filled with fun, creativity, and the joy of exploring new things. And while these Sunday classes were intended for children, I believe that they added to the cozy, warm atmosphere of the café as a whole. I certainly cherish this experience as one of the fondest of my childhood. But my café adventures did not just involve sweet treats and decorating cookies. On one visit, my family and I were seated beside a group of elderly women who were happily chatting away. I was immediately curious about them, and with a shy smile, I struck up a conversation. As it turns out, these women had been meeting up at the café every Tuesday for over twenty years! They all attended the same high school and had been lifelong friends. I marveled at their bond and was touched by their shared history. As I grew older, my tastes in food and drink evolved, and I started to appreciate the real star of the café – the coffee. While my parents favored sugary treats, I would order cappuccinos and lattes, sipping slowly and savoring the flavors. It was during these moments that I would often daydream about my future, a future in which I hoped to attend a prestigious university, such as Harvard or Yale. It seemed like a far-off dream at the time, but I was determined to achieve it. In retrospect, my childhood adventures at the café may have seemed humdrum to some, but to me, they were magical. They represented my first steps toward independence, my realization of the power of creativity, and the wonder of shared experiences. I will always have a special place in my heart for that cozy café – the one that held such a special place in my past. As I embark on my own academic pursuits, I strive to bring that same sense of wonder and curiosity with me. I want to embrace every new experience and cherish every journey, much like I did during my childhood adventures at the café.

It was my escape, my fantasy world, where I could be anyone I wanted to be. As I grew older, the café became more than just a place for fantasy and adventure. It became a place of introspection, learning, and connection. I realized that the café was a microcosm of life, where every interaction, every experience, and every moment was an opportunity to learn from the people around us. One of my most memorable café experiences happened when I was in college. I had just finished an exam, and I wanted to de-stress and relax. I went to a café near my college, ordered a latte, and sat in a corner, observing the people around me. As I sipped my latte, I noticed a young girl sitting at the next table, reading a book. She was absorbed in her reading, oblivious to the people around her. I was intrigued, and I struck up a conversation with her. We talked for hours, about books, movies, music, and life. She opened up to me, and I listened intently, fascinated by her perspective on life. As I left the café that day, I realized that the café was more than just a place for coffee; it was a place for connection, growth, and learning. Over the years, I have visited countless cafes, in different cities, countries, and cultures. Every café has its unique ambiance, its distinct flavors, and its diverse clientele. But the one thing that remains consistent across all cafes is the sense of community, the feeling of belongingness that transcends boundaries. The café has taught me the value of empathy, kindness, and diversity. It has taught me that every person has a story to tell, and every interaction has the power to shape our worldview. It has taught me that the world is small, and we are all connected, and the power of empathy and kindness can transcend borders, age, and cultures. As I reflect on my café adventures, I realize that the café has become a metaphor for life. Life, like the café, presents us with a myriad of experiences, from bitter to sweet, from loud to soft, from happy to sad. The key to enjoying life, just like a good cup of coffee, lies in savoring every moment, celebrating the connections, and learning from the diversity. The café has given me the confidence to explore new horizons, to embrace diversity, and to celebrate life's little moments. It has taught me the power of connection, the beauty of individuality, and the importance of community. As I embark on my journey into the future, I hope to take these values with me, and continue to savor life, one cup of coffee at a time. In conclusion, the café has played a significant role in shaping my worldview and my approach to life. It has given me a sense of belonging, a passion for learning and growth, and a commitment to empathy and kindness. As I sit in a café, sipping my latte and observing the people around me, I realize that the world is a beautiful place, full of diversity, hope, and connection. And for that, I am grateful to the café, the place where I learned to savor life.",0,2.583794679,2.815604314,2.945647262,3.159196326,2.889268933,13.0,16.0,20.0,25.0,18.0
C2,280,"The warm aroma of coffee filled the air as I walked through the doors of the café. The sound of chatter and clanking cups resonated through the room, making it feel alive. It was my safe haven, a place I knew I would always feel welcomed. Growing up, my parents would take me here every Saturday. I would run my fingers across the spines of the books, inhale the faint smell of ink, and flip through pages. It was a place where I could be anyone and anything through the pages of a book. As I grew older, the café became more than just my escape. I realized that it was a place where I could learn, meet new people, and grow. One day, while sitting in a café near my college after a stressful exam, I saw a young girl at the table next to me, fully absorbed in her book. I struck up a conversation with her, and it turned into hours of conversation on books, music, and life. She told me about her culture, and it sparked something in me. I knew then that the café was more than just a place for coffee; it was a place for growth and connection. I have visited countless cafes since that moment, from bustling coffee shops in large cities to intimate cafes in small towns. Every place had its unique feel, its flavor, and its clientele. But the one thing that remains the same is the sense of community - the feeling of belongingness that permeated every corner of the café. The café has taught me the importance of empathy, kindness, and diversity. It showed me that the boisterous baristas, the hushed writers, and the bubbly couple on a first date are all on different paths in life, but they all share one thing- their love for coffee, stories, and connection. The café has shown me that the world is small, and we are all connected, and the power of empathy and kindness can transcend borders, age, and cultures. As I reflect on my café experiences, I realize that the café is a metaphor for life. Life is like a hot cup of coffee, a journey of bitter-sweet moments, from the sharp tang of a lemon, to the buttery smoothness of caramel. We sip and slurp through it all, and the key to enjoying life lies in savoring every moment, celebrating the connections, and learning from the diversity. The café has given me the courage to explore new horizons, to celebrate diversity, and to live life to the fullest.

H,281,"I was born with an extra hand—kind of. Anatomically, I’m normal. I don’t have a third arm protruding from the center of my chest or anything of the sort. I do, however, have the unusual ability to use both hands equally well. When I was little, I thought of my ambidexterity as a fun trick. I always liked to play with people when learning a new skill: “Okay, now are you right or left handed?” “I don’t know,” I would answer with a comical smile. Or even better, “Pick one for me.” It’s a bit silly, but I enjoyed the simple satisfaction of being different. For me, ambidexterity has always meant versatility. From using my left hand in a restrictive corner while doing yardwork to switch-hitting in baseball depending on the context of the game, my hands give me the flexibility to adapt to my surroundings. As I’ve grown, however, I’ve realized that ambidexterity means more than just its quirky face value. It’s synonymous with many of the other components of my character. Ambidexterity is part of who I am, yet it’s something few people know I have. It makes sense that only my closest friends know about my dual-handed capabilities. Although I use my talent throughout my day, it usually blends in with the normal functions of anyone else’s hands. In this sense, ambidexterity isn’t some glaring anomaly: It’s only when you realize it’s there does it become special. Similarly, much of who I am remains unnoticed at first glance, not because of insignificance but because of initial perception. Most of the people who know me have no clue I’m valedictorian; I’m the kid making paper airplanes at the end of class. The rest don’t realize I “do more than just school” but are pleasantly surprised to see me dancing around as Risky Business Tom Cruise for Halloween or just hanging out all over town on weekends. I like to think that ambidexterity helps me juggle these different parts of myself without letting anything go. In my job as a Little League umpire, I have three distinct identities. To the league manager, I’m the responsible, quick-replying emailer and the primary person for the job. To the coaches, I’m a wave a relief—they know I’m going to make the right call. To the young players, I’m the umpire who gives helpful tips as well as the one they feel comfortable joking around with. Though each of these roles helps me in their own way, collectively, they are the reason I was made the lead umpire of the league. In terms of academics, ambidexterity means finishing a half-hour phone call trying to understand the complexities of William Faulkner and immediately turning around to text watered-down calculus explanations to help another student. My ability to transition quickly has helped me establish myself as a go-to helper in nearly every subject, but these behind-the-scenes interactions happen away from my teachers’ eyes. Even teachers, however, see the respect other students have for me during class discussions. Outside of class, other students come to me because they recognize that I genuinely want to help guide them toward their own success. When it comes down to it, ambidexterity means balance. From athlete to academic, from reliable employee to kind-hearted helper, I take on an array of roles in my life. Just as my two hands merge to create a more efficient system, my personal flexibility allows me to handle the many aspects of my life from different angles. Although each part of me is individually effective, my most complete self comes from applying them together. It allows me to become more than just efficient or well-rounded but a better friend, a more fitting leader, and a respected role model. So now, when I run into the inevitable questions in college applications about who I really am, I can answer clearly: I am ambidextrous.",1,2.404724971,2.762606385,2.880734219,3.133936442,2.818723561,13.0,16.2,20.0,24.4,18.5
C0,282,"It was a hot summer day in July, and I found myself sitting in front of the grand piano in our living room. I had just turned five, and my parents had enrolled me in piano lessons, hoping to awaken my musical potential. My left hand clumsily hit the keys, struggling to keep up with my right's fluid movements. Frustrated by my lack of progress, I put my left hand in my lap and continued with my right hand. My teacher noticed and asked why I wasn't using both hands. I shrugged, telling her that I only had one good hand. To her surprise, I played the rest of the song using only my left hand. That was the beginning of my journey as an ambidextrous person. At first, ambidexterity was just a curious skill that made people stare in awe. I could write with both hands, dribble a basketball with ease, and even cut my vegetables with my left hand while stirring a pot of soup with my right. However, as I grew older and delved deeper into my interests, I realized that ambidexterity was more than just versatility - it was a powerful tool that helped me thrive in various aspects of my life. One area where ambidexterity proved useful was in sports. As a basketball enthusiast, being able to use both hands gave me an edge in the court. I quickly became a formidable opponent, especially when driving to the basket. My ability to switch hands seamlessly left my opponents confused and frustrated, and I often made shots that would have been impossible with just one hand. Moreover, ambidexterity prevented me from developing muscle imbalances that could lead to injuries. I could switch between arms when lifting weights, ensuring that both sides of my body were equally strong. However, my ambidexterity had an even more significant impact on my academic endeavors. As a science and math enthusiast, being able to use both hands was especially advantageous when solving complex problems or drawing intricate graphs. I could seamlessly switch between hands when sketching diagrams or writing equations, making the process faster and more efficient. Additionally, I could take notes with both hands, a skill that came in handy during lectures, allowing me to jot down equations or key points without slowing down. Moreover, as someone with a deep passion for music, ambidexterity proved invaluable in my pursuits. I often composed music, brainstorming ideas with my right hand and transcribing them onto the piano with my left. This back-and-forth process allowed me to come up with melodies that might have been impossible with just one hand. Also, my ability to play the guitar with equal ease on either side meant that I could perform complicated hand movements that would have been challenging for a single-handed guitarist. However, ambidexterity had an even more unexpected impact on my life - it taught me the importance of adaptability. Growing up as a middle child in a family of five, I had to learn how to navigate various situations to find my place. Whether it was mediating squabbles between my younger and older siblings or adapting to new schools and neighborhoods, I had to be versatile in my approach. However, my ambidexterity took that adaptability to another level. It taught me that sometimes the best approach to a situation is not to choose one side or the other, but to find a middle ground. Like using both hands, sometimes the best solution is to utilize both perspectives of a situation. As I reflect on my journey as an ambidextrous person, I realize that it has taught me more about myself than simply having an impressive resume skill or a knack for scoring on the basketball court. It has taught me the importance of versatility, adaptability, and the power of embracing diversified perspectives. The ability to use both hands has given me a unique outlook on life, one that allows me to approach challenges with a creative and flexible mindset. As I prepare to apply to Yale or Harvard, I am confident that my ambidexterity is a skill that will set me apart. But more than that, I know it has taught me invaluable life lessons and ways of thinking that will benefit me no matter what path I choose. I am grateful for the opportunity to embrace and hone this skill and look forward to seeing where its adaptability and versatility will take me next.",0,2.635568164,2.802610762,3.107455828,3.186428004,2.855596153,13.2,17.4,21.8,26.0,19.0
C1,283,"Growing up, I always had a deep love for basketball. Countless hours spent perfecting my shot and dribbling skills on the court slowly transformed me into a formidable player. I was a force to be reckoned with, scoring points that others could only dream of. However, what set me apart from the rest of the players was not just my love for the game, but my unique ability to use both my hands with equal ease and precision. Being ambidextrous allowed me to execute moves that most players could only do with one hand. Whether it was driving to the basket or faking out an opponent with a crossover, I had an additional level of flexibility that often left my opponents in a state of confusion. But ambidexterity went beyond just playing basketball; it was something that encompassed every aspect of my life. It was a hot summer day when I first realized my talent. I was sitting at the grand piano in my house, and my mother was trying to teach me how to play. I had never shown any interest in music, but my mother insisted that I try. As I sat there attempting to hit the right notes, the keys felt foreign under my fingers. I was clumsy, and my hand movements seemed jarring and awkward. I put my left hand in my lap, irritated by my lack of progress, but my mother noticed and gently scolded me by asking why I was not using it. It was like a eureka moment. As I placed my left hand on the keys, I felt a sense of control that I had never experienced before. The music flowed out of me effortlessly. It was as if I had tapped into something new and exciting. That day, I left the piano room with a newfound appreciation for my unique talent. But the effects of ambidexterity didn't stop at just music and sports; it encompassed every aspect of my life. In academics, being ambidextrous allowed me to take notes faster and with greater efficiency. I could switch hands when my right hand grew tired or I could jot down notes on two different pages of my notebook simultaneously. This flexibility proved indispensable, especially during exam season when time was of the essence. Ambidexterity had an interesting effect on my relationships with people as well. At first glance, most people think that I am a shy and reserved person, someone who does not stand out in a crowd. However, my ambidexterity has gifted me with a unique set of social skills that have allowed me to connect with people from all walks of life. Due to the way ambidexterity subtly blends in with everyday activities, people do not realize I am ambidextrous until I reveal it to them. This has often surprised and delighted my friends, opening up avenues for more meaningful conversations. What I have learned from my ambidexterity is that, for me, it is not just a quirky trait but an essential part of who I am. It's made me adapt to situations that I would have found challenging if I were not ambidextrous. Due to my unique talent, I am no longer afraid to take risks and try new things. My dual-handed capabilities have shown me that the things that set us apart from the rest of society are often the greatest gifts we have. In conclusion, ambidexterity has been a gift that has shaped my life in ways that would have been impossible without it. It has taught me to embrace my unique qualities and use them to my advantage. The power of two hands has opened up new avenues for me, given me a newfound appreciation for everyday tasks, and taught me to find the beauty in unexpected places.

C2,284,"The sun blazed down on the basketball court with an intensity that seemed to rival the passion I felt for the game. The court was full of sounds; the pounding of the ball against the pavement, the squeak of shoes against the court, and the occasional grunt of exertion. I was in my element, dribbling the ball with both hands, deftly moving in and out of the defense. With expert precision, I released the ball, and it sailed through the air, passed the outstretched arms of my opponent and into the hoop. As I sprinted back down the court, I felt the thrill of adrenaline coursing through my veins. The knowledge that my ambidexterity had allowed me to execute that move with both hands was both exhilarating and empowering. The joy of knowing that my unique talent was setting me apart from the rest of the players was an indescribable feeling. But it wasn't just basketball where my ambidexterity came into play. The world of music surrounded me, enveloping me with the sweet soft tones of a grand piano. The polished wood felt cool beneath my fingertips as I placed my left hand on the keys, ready to start playing. My fingers floated across the keys, the notes blending together to create a melody that resonated within me. The music flowed from my fingers like water from a stream, unhindered and unrestricted. Being ambidextrous had given me a skill that I was proud of, and it had brought a new light to my life of which I was eternally grateful. In academics, using both hands with equal ease was a game-changer. The day of the exam, the room was full of the click-clack of mechanical pencils, frantic page turning, and deep breaths of concentration. I furiously scribbled on my papers, switching hands when one grew tired from the rapid movements of writing. Slightly tilting my head from side to side, I focused with sheer determination, engulfed in a chaotic frenzy. It was at that moment that I understood the true merit of being ambidextrous. I had the ability to complete the exam faster and with greater precision because of my dual-handed capabilities. Being ambidextrous shifted my perspective and allowed me to view the world through a unique lens, which in turn opened up avenues for meaningful conversations. While talking with friends, I might be absentmindedly drawing on a sheet of paper with both hands, each moving in a synchronized dance. Subconsciously, I would feel a connection with those around me, and it seemed that people found it easier to trust and confide in me. My ambidexterity allowed me to open myself up to new experiences and new people, which helped me establish deep-rooted connections with those in my inner circle. What I have learned is that being different is not something to be ashamed of, but something to embrace. In a world where conformity is often the norm, being ambidextrous has allowed me to stand out and provided me with experiences that others may not have had. It has become an integral part of who I am, and it has taught me to embrace my unique talents and quirks, that make me who I am. I have learned that sometimes, the things that separate us from the rest of society can be the greatest things about us. In conclusion, my ambidexterity has taught me to be innovative in how I approach life's challenges. It has instilled a sense of confidence and independence that has allowed me to hurdle over barriers that would have been left unattainable otherwise. I have learned that the power of two hands lies within me and that it is essential to recognize our strengths and limitations in order to push forward.

H,285,"“Is it bigger than a breadbox?” “Yes.” I have always been tall, decidedly tall. Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height. Starting at a young age, I would ask countless questions, from “How heavy is the Earth?” to “Where does rain come from?” My curiosity, displayed in questions like these, has truly defined me as a person and as a student. Therefore, it is not surprising that I became transfixed the first time I played 20Q (the electronic version of Twenty Questions). Somehow, a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking. The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in 20Q. This interest would later reveal valuable character traits of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life. “Does it strive to learn?” “Yes.” I became determined to discover how 20Q guessed correctly. After some research, I discovered artificial intelligence, more specifically, artificial neural networks—systems which learn and improve themselves. This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. I read avidly, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could. When given the opportunity years later, I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me. I found myself in an environment I loved. I would stay after class, go in during free periods, make my own apps, and work over Cloud-based IDEs. I prized the freedom and the possibilities. “Is it driven?” “Yes.” After my introduction to 20Q, I began to play Twenty Questions (the traditional parlor game) and became determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the artificial intelligence. At first I was mediocre. However, through long car rides with family, good-natured yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy, and time, I became more effective. I discovered the “secrets” to success: practice and perseverance. “Does it apply what it learns?” “Yes.” As 20Q implements what it learns, so do I. Throughout high school, I applied the “secret” of practice to my basketball career. I spent countless hours sharpening my skills in 90° summer heat to 20° late-winter cold, countless afternoons playing pickup games with my friends, and countless weekends traveling to AAU basketball tournaments. As a result, I became a starter for my school’s varsity team. I applied another “secret,” this time the “secret” of perseverance, by dedicating myself to physical therapy after knee surgery in order to quickly return to football. Later that year, I became the first player in my grade to score a varsity touchdown. “Does it attempt to better itself?” “Yes.” Once I became proficient at Twenty Questions, I strengthened my resolve to become masterful. To do so, I needed to become a skillful inquisitor and to combine that with my analytical nature and interpersonal skills, all of which are vital for success in Twenty Questions. Because I had been debating politics with my friends since the 8th grade, I recognized that debate could sharpen these skills. I began to debate more frequently (and later more effectively) in English and government class, at the lunch table and family gatherings, and whenever the opportunity presented itself. This spurred in me an interest for how public policy and government work, leading me to attend Boys State and receive a nomination for The United States Senate Youth Program. “Does it think deeply?” “Yes.” So far, I have realized that thriving at Twenty Questions, just like life, is all about tenacity, rationality and interpersonal skills. I have found that, as in Twenty Questions, always succeeding is impossible; however, by persevering through difficulties and obstacles, favorable outcomes are often attainable. As I have become better at Twenty Questions, so too have I improved in many other aspects of my life. Nonetheless, I realize that I still have unbounded room to grow. And much like 20Q, I will continue to learn throughout my life and apply my knowledge to everything I do. “Are you thinking of me?” “Yes.”'",1,2.409159933,2.750577607,3.04504363,3.282035171,2.92955415,9.2,15.4,19.6,25.6,17.0
C0,286,"As long as I can remember, I have always been curious. Curiosity is what motivates me to explore new things, ask questions, and ponder the mysteries of the world. I believe it is this quality that has shaped my character and the person I am today. Growing up, I was always seeking new knowledge and experiences. I devoured books, watched documentaries, and went on adventures with my family. My desire to learn about the world around me led me to want to study science, and in particular, biology. I wanted to understand how living things worked and how they interacted with their environment. As I started taking more advanced courses in high school, I found that my curiosity extended beyond just the sciences. I became interested in philosophy, psychology, and even politics. I started to realize that curiosity wasn’t just about seeking knowledge, but about being open to new perspectives and ideas. One experience that really solidified this was a trip I took to Washington D.C. for the Junior States of America conference. I was surprised at how passionate and knowledgeable my fellow high school students were about politics, and how much I had to learn. It was humbling, but it also sparked a fire in me. I wanted to understand the complexities of our government and the world we lived in. My curiosity has also helped me develop my character. I’ve learned that being curious means being willing to take risks, to speak up when necessary, and to be open to feedback. For instance, when I started volunteering at a hospital, I was eager to learn from the doctors and nurses I worked with. But I also knew that I had to be willing to ask questions and speak up when I didn’t understand something. This experience showed me the importance of being humble, being willing to learn from others, and being willing to ask for help when necessary. These are qualities I believe are essential to developing good character. Curiosity has also helped me develop empathy and a sense of social justice. As I learned more about the world, I became aware of the injustices and inequalities that exist. I wanted to understand why these disparities existed and what could be done to change them. This led me to start volunteering with an after-school program in a low-income community. As I got to know the students and families, I saw firsthand the challenges they faced. I also saw their resilience and determination in the face of those challenges. My curiosity led me to learn about the history of systemic racism and poverty in our country, and how it still affects people today. I realized that empathy and social justice were not just buzzwords, but things that required real action and advocacy. While I still have much to learn, I believe that my curiosity has helped shape my character in positive ways. It has taught me to be open-minded, humble, and empathetic. It has also motivated me to take action and work towards making the world a better place. In conclusion, curiosity has been a driving force in my life, shaping both my academic and personal pursuits. It has taught me to be open to new ideas and perspectives, to speak up for what I believe in, and to be willing to take risks. Most importantly, it has shaped my character, making me more empathetic, humble, and determined to make a positive impact in the world. I hope to bring this curiosity and character to the next stage of my life, and I believe that attending Yale or Harvard will provide me with the opportunities to continue growing and learning in meaningful ways.",0,2.477817931,2.769404689,2.849020075,3.06363301,2.813771637,11.8,16.0,19.4,22.0,17.0

C2,288,"As I sit on the bench, I hear the squeak of my basketball shoes against the polished floor. It’s a sound that has become intimately familiar to me over countless hours of practice. The court in front of me is bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun, casting long shadows across the polished wood. It’s a peaceful moment, but my mind is buzzing with questions and ideas. I can’t help but think about the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, a topic that has consumed my curiosity for years. I remember the first time I played 20Q as a child. The electronic device made magic by guessing what I was thinking based on a few questions. I was transfixed by the technology behind it, and my curiosity led me to explore the more complex world of artificial intelligence. I spent hours studying artificial neural networks and learning programming languages, fascinated by the way algorithms could help machines replicate human thought processes. But my passion for AI has also taught me the value of persistence and dedication. I remember debugging programs, the endless streams of code and countless sleepless nights. But I never gave up. My curiosity led me to develop a deep understanding of AI and neural networks, which has continued to be a source of inspiration for me. And that same persistence has helped me in my other passions, particularly basketball. I’ve spent countless hours practicing my shot, honing my skills on the court, and developing my strategy. It’s that same focus and determination that led me to become a starter for my high school varsity team. But even when faced with the adversity of a knee injury that required surgery, I didn’t give up. While others might have seen the injury as a setback, I used it as an opportunity to hone my physical therapy and come back stronger. I was able to return to the field and score a varsity touchdown. My curiosity has also been a driving force in my academic pursuits. I am always eager to learn new things and explore new fields. Volunteering at the hospital gave me a first-hand look into the medical field, and I was fascinated by the intricacies of healthcare. I asked questions, observed their techniques, and sought out opportunities to learn more. Through this experience, I learned the importance of collaboration and communication, which helped me to develop new skills and deepen my understanding of the healthcare field. But my thirst for knowledge has also driven me toward a social justice. Through my work with low-income communities through an after-school program, I saw firsthand the challenges that marginalized populations face. Learning about systemic poverty and racism fueled my passion for social justice and my desire to advocate for change. But the most fascinating aspect of my curiosity has been its synergy with my empathy. By seeking out experiences that exposed me to others’ perspectives and struggles, I have become more aware of the injustices and inequalities that exist in our society. And that passion for change continues to push me forward. Attending Yale or Harvard will provide me with the opportunities I need to continue growing and learning. I am excited to be surrounded by a community of like-minded individuals who are as passionate and curious as I am. I am eager to delve deeper into artificial intelligence and explore new fields of study such as quantum computing, advanced neurosciences, and mathematics. I hope to use my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the world around me. In conclusion, I recognize that curiosity has been a guiding light throughout my life. From playing 20Q as a child to studying artificial neural networks and basketball, my curiosity has allowed me to expand my knowledge and understanding of the world. It has taught me the importance of persistence, dedication, collaboration, and empathy. And it is that same curiosity that will continue to propel my growth and development in the future. I am excited about the prospect of attending Yale or Harvard, and I am confident that, with my curiosity and determination, I can achieve great things and make a positive impact on the world.",0,2.711473127,2.812006234,3.068020416,3.395593837,2.892218019,13.0,15.2,18.8,23.0,18.0
H,289,"Goal: 40,000. I wrote because it made me somebody else—somebody who mattered. The power of writing, I believed, existed solely in one’s ability to pursue the sublime. So I wrote to create different, better manifestations of my life. I grew up dreaming and writing (and thinking they were the same) about being a Hermione Granger with Harry as my sidekick battling twenty Voldemorts (twenty!); my stories were dynamic. I was cool. Status: 5,000. My mom once joked that I should audition for the role of Cho Chang. I threw a chopstick at her. Cho Chang was weak, so terribly weak that Harry dumped her. I knew why she said it though—I rarely existed in books and when I did, I was the Cho Chang, the inconsequential, insignificant Asian girl who could never assert herself. In a fit of spite, I killed my Hermione, realizing I could never be her. Status: 1,000. Somebody once told me to read The Joy Luck Club but I never bothered. A book about a bunch of Cho Changs couldn’t possibly be sublime. Instead, I buried myself in the books hidden under my bed, away from Mom, about girls in high school who didn’t do anything besides fall in love. So, to improve my own story, I decided to fall in love with the first boy to call me pretty. I was satisfied. Status: 8,000. Living life vicariously was comfortable and easy. Perhaps that’s why, at fifteen, I paid no mind to my grandpa’s deteriorating health or my dad’s anxiety. Because these were not the kinds of pain I had ever read about, I didn’t find them good enough to write about. So, I went looking for better inspiration—for more mockeries of love, ways to validate my insecurities, and priorities that shouldn’t have been labeled as such. It was all so cool that I couldn’t stop writing about it. Status: 11,000. During this magnificent, glorious streak of writing, dreaming, and pretending, I learned that 40,000 words make a novel. I had to do it. Once I get published, everybody would get a taste of my sublimity. Mom and Dad would be so impressed. I’d probably even become famous! Hence, I became fervently obsessed with word count and cared for little else. Status: 15,000. But then I turned seventeen and finally began to process what I had experienced years earlier. I had been witness to my grandpa, reduced to flesh and bones (but hardly any flesh), barely clinging to life in a maggot-infested hospital in Dengzhou—something I had forced myself to forget. Suddenly, I couldn’t keep pretending that crafting a fictitious version of my life on paper could replace what is real. I erased everything. Status: 0. I started over. I wrote about my real thoughts, my family, the times I was happy, and the times I was not. I wrote about my grandpa. I showed Dad. I thought he’d be proud. He was not. What? You wrote this? Why? What are you trying to prove? Nothing. For the first time, nothing. I’m just writing about life. But you should keep that private. It’s too revealing and distressing. It’s not… Sublime. I know. It’s. Not. Sublime. I crumbled. Then came the summer before my senior year. I finally read The Joy Luck Club. In the entire novel, I didn’t come across a single Cho Chang. What took the place of sublimity, instead, were real people. Mothers and daughters who breathe and hurt and love. I laughed and cried and began to write. Status: Not counting anymore. I don’t write to create the next Hermione, become the best cliché, or impress Mom and Dad. I write to express the thoughts that are most real to me, ones I cannot confine any longer. I am real and I care about being real—that is my power, not just as a writer but as a person.",1,1.538070359,1.769421767,2.434930865,2.743541513,2.11059867,2.0,5.0,9.8,16.4,6.0
C0,290,"A blank page is intimidating. For many of us, the fear of a blank page is not just the fear of the unknown but the fear of what we might discover. After all, writing is often a means of self-discovery, a way to confront our fears, and gain insight into who we are. As a high school senior, I can attest to the transformative power of writing, as I have used writing to embark on a journey of self-discovery, to find my voice, and to discover the person I want to be. I used to think that writing was just a way to get a good grade. When I was a freshman, English papers were little more than an annoying requirement, something that I had to get through to maintain my grades. But as I got older, I began to see writing in a different light. I started to notice how I could use it to express my deepest fears, to explore my beliefs and values, and to confront the world around me. And as I began to write more, I began to discover things about myself I never knew or had explored before. For example, I always thought I was an introvert until I started writing a blog documenting my thoughts and reflection. Through writing, I began to realize that I had an introverted personality, but that I also loved to connect with people. Writing helped me to find a way to engage with others on my own terms, and to express myself in ways that felt authentic and true. But writing is not just a tool for self-expression; it is also a means of self-evaluation. In writing, I have learned to confront my shortcomings, to recognize my biases and to transition towards a more open-minded approach. Writing has forced to me articulate my opinions in a concise and clear manner, as well as think through the arguments that conflicted with my own. I have learned through writing to be more empathetic and patient, and to understand that people often have reasons for seeing the world differently from me. Through writing, I have also discovered that many of my fears and anxieties stem from a fear of failure. I had always seen myself as an achiever, someone who was successful in most of their endeavors. But when I started to write, I began to realize that my fear of failure was holding me back. Through writing, I started to embrace my weaknesses as opportunities for growth and began to look for chances to learn from my mistakes. In this way, writing has become a critical component of my self-discovery journey; it has opened up a new path for me to explore the world around me and to grow into the person I want to be. As I look towards the future, I see writing as a key tool for not only personal growth, but also for professional success. At Yale or Harvard, I hope to use writing to engage with the world in a more profound way. Through their English programs and other writing-related opportunities, I hope to dive deeper into my interests and passions, to learn and engage with great writers and thinkers from history, and to use writing to create a positive impact in the world. I am keenly aware that engaging with new people and ideas is critical to the growth of this community, which is why I am so excited about the opportunity that writing presents. Writing is a means for me to connect and engage with individuals from all walks of life, to bridge the differences that divide us and to create a shared dialogue to shape our future. I know that academic success is not just about getting good grades, but about actively engaging with the world in a productive way, and that requires us to take risks, to face our fears, and to find our voice. Writing has taught me how to do just that, to push past the fear of the blank page, to confront the challenges that lay ahead of me, and to find the person I want to be. In short, writing has become my compass, my guiding light, and my vehicle towards a better tomorrow. I am excited to continue this journey at Yale or Harvard, where I hope to engage with brilliant minds and immerse myself in a community of individuals who share my passion for writing and dedication to personal growth. Writing, whether it is academic or creative, formal or informal, has become a critical part of who I am, and I can't wait to continue to use it as a means of self-discovery, and a tool for making the world a better place.",0,2.693546351,2.889381535,3.026171726,3.378489298,2.982507752,19.0,21.0,26.0,36.0,23.0
C1,291,"Writing is truly a powerful tool. For me, writing was a way to become someone else, someone who mattered. When I was younger, I wrote stories about Hermione Granger and Harry battling Voldemorts, creating different and better manifestations of my life. My writing was a way for me to escape into a world full of endless possibilities, where anything was possible. Over time, however, my writing evolved as I grew up, and I began to realize the true power of writing. The true power of writing isn't just in the ability to create sublimity, as I once believed, but to be real, honest, and vulnerable. As an Asian girl growing up, I wasn't often represented in books, and when I was, I was often the insignificant, inconsequential side character, like Cho Chang in Harry Potter. In my frustration, I killed off my own Hermione, realizing that becoming her was impossible. Instead, I buried myself in books about high school girls falling in love. But I soon learned that living vicariously wasn't enough. I needed to confront the real and challenging aspects of life. I witnessed my grandpa's deteriorating health and my dad's anxiety, but because these were not the pains I had read about, I didn't find them worthy of exploring in my writing. I searched for better inspiration for writing, but I realized that the best inspiration came from writing about the most authentic parts of life. It was then that I began to write about my real thoughts, my family, the times when I was happy, and the times when I was not. I wrote about my grandpa and showed my dad, thinking he would be proud. But he was not. It was too revealing and distressing for him. It wasn't 'sublime,' as he said, and I crumbled under the criticism. I erased everything and started over. It wasn't until I read The Joy Luck Club that I realized the power of writing to be real. The novel was full of real people – mothers and daughters who breathe, hurt, and love. They weren't caricatures or stereotypes, but true representations of life. Reading this novel allowed me to explore the complexities of life through writing, and I realized that I didn't write to create the next Hermione or to impress my parents, but to express my most honest thoughts. Writing to be real is not easy. It requires acknowledging the uncomfortable parts of ourselves, the parts that others might reject or criticize. But writing to be real is also a way to connect with others. By sharing our stories and vulnerabilities, we can create empathy and understanding, especially when the world can feel disconnected and fragmented. Writing to be real is a way to bridge gaps and build relationships. Writing to be real requires courage, as does any form of vulnerability. But it is only through vulnerability that we can truly connect with others. In a world that values perfection and masks, it takes courage to be honest and unfiltered. However, the rewards of this kind of writing are immeasurable. By being brave enough to tell our stories, we can create lasting connections and make a positive impact on those around us. Writing to be real has transformed me as a person and as a writer. I want to use my words to make a difference in the world, to create stories that inspire, uplift, and challenge readers to see things differently. It means calling attention to the inequalities and injustices that exist in the world and using my words to effect change. As I move forward into the next phase of my life, I want to continue writing to be real. I want to be honest with myself and with others, using my words to build connections and make a difference in the world. Writing to be real is not just a way of writing, but a way of living and being. It is a commitment to authenticity and vulnerability, and I am excited about the possibilities that this kind of writing will bring.",0,2.233201085,2.378926074,2.764047047,2.926919868,2.632338959,10.8,13.6,19.0,22.2,16.0
C2,292,"The sharp scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air as I sat down to write. The comforting sound of rain tapping against the windowpane outside was the perfect backdrop to my thoughts. This cozy environment was perfect for zoning out and just letting the words flow onto paper. As I started to write about my family, the sounds of pots and pans clattering in the kitchen interrupted my thoughts. My mom's cooking had always been a source of comfort, and the smells emanating from the oven were a reminder of the sense of security and love that I had always felt at home. The sharp sound of a kitchen timer snapping me back into reality, I continued to write about my family, candidly and honestly. My grandpa's voice echoed in my mind as I wrote about the last time I saw him. I could still see the stern tone of his face as he tried to hide his pain, and I wanted to write about it. But as soon as I tried, a sense of sadness and despair washed over me. The ink on the page was smudged with teardrops. It wasn't just his illness that was hard to confront, but also the fear that I had of losing him. How much longer could we keep him with us? It was difficult to be real about it, but through writing, I could at least express my emotions. Writing to be real isn't always warm and cozy. Sometimes, it is about confronting the harsh truths that are often too difficult to admit. It is about confronting our own insecurities and bringing them to the surface. It is about being vulnerable and honest, even when it is painful. In writing, I've found a way to confront those truths. It has allowed me to express the parts of me that I kept hidden for so long, the parts that I was afraid people would judge or criticize. Writing has become an escape, a safe haven where I can be myself without any judgment or expectations. By writing authentically, I have also learned to appreciate the complexities of life. It has allowed me to rejoice in the small moments of joy that often pass by unnoticed. It has also taught me to confront the difficult moments in life with resilience and grace. Writing to be real isn't just about the words on the page - it’s about the connection we have to ourselves and to others. Through writing honestly, we reveal a side of ourselves that is often kept hidden. We reveal our flaws, our weaknesses, and our fears. These honest portrayals of ourselves can be a source of inspiration and a way to connect with others on a deeper level. In today's world, where we are constantly bombarded with images of perfection, writing to be real is a breath of fresh air. It is a way to connect with others on a human level, to acknowledge the highs and lows of life, and to inspire and uplift others. So, as I move forward into the next phase of my life, I am excited about the possibilities that writing to be real holds. I want to use my words to make a difference in the world, to create stories that inspire, uplift and challenge readers to see things differently. More importantly, I want to use my words to connect with others on a deeper and more honest level. As I sit down to write, the sound of the coffee brewing, the smell of my mom's cooking, and the sounds of rain are all reminders of the comforts of home. But more than that, these sensory details are reminders of what is most important – the connection we have to the people we love and the memories that we cherish. By writing to be real, we create a world that is more honest, more compassionate, and more real.",0,2.298680992,2.641318059,2.773835797,2.999580548,2.734751479,13.0,17.0,19.4,24.0,18.0
H,293,"“Do you have body bags? The leak-proof kind…we need as many as you can spare!” My shoulders slumped as the voice on the phone offered me camera bags instead. I was sixteen and had just returned from an infectious diseases course at Emory University, where my final presentation was on Ebola. Within weeks, the first infected American arrived at Emory for treatment. Our country panicked, while thousands lay dying in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, their last visions strangers in spacesuits. I ached for the people, especially the children, who were dying alone, and I needed to help. Drawing on my new knowledge of Ebola’s pathology, I had an idea that I thought might work. Ebola Kits. Rubber gloves, masks, and bleach, shrink-wrapped together inside a sturdy bucket, instructions in pictures to bridge the languages of Mende, French, Krio, Fula, and Susu. While the kits contained only the bare necessities, they would allow people to care for family and neighbors without inviting the spread of Ebola. Doing nothing was genocide, with generations of families disappearing overnight. The images haunted me, lifeless bodies in dirt, oblivious to the flies swarming around them, as everyone watched from a safe distance. I pitched my idea to The Afya Foundation, a global health NGO I have worked with since the 2010 Haiti earthquake. I was on a mission. Ebola kits in every village. Easy to assemble and ship. Potential to save thousands. While I received an enthusiastic response to my idea, Afya’s team sent me on a different mission: obtaining body bags, the unfortunate reality of people who were invisible in a world that waited far too long to see them. I spent two weeks calling body bag suppliers after school. Treatment centers were desperate, wrapping bodies in garbage bags with duct tape and tossing them mindlessly into the ground. It was disrespectful, even inhumane, because West African burials include washing, touching, and kissing the bodies. Without these rituals, West Africans believe the spirit of the deceased can never be at peace. Culture and medicine were colliding head-on, and there was no easy solution. While Ebola made these rituals lethal, at least body bags allowed people to be safely buried and not treated like garbage. After many failed attempts, I reached a funeral home director who donated body bags from his own supply. Public health is one of the most pressing and complex issues we face as a global society, and it is my passion. I am disturbed that not all lives are valued equally. I cannot accept the fact that children die from preventable diseases, simply because they are born in countries with less wealth and stability. In America, we are curing cancer with a mutated poliovirus strain, but we haven’t eradicated polio in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We come together in crises, highly publicized earthquakes and tsunamis, but we haven’t come together to solve the problem of basic human health, a right for every person on earth. Ensuring our health is complicated and daunting and requires the mass coordination of agencies and governments to build sustainable infrastructures with local citizens in charge. I want to be part of the solution and am engaging in public health in every way I can: in the field, in the classroom, and through global health charities. From Yonkers to Accra, I have met the most amazing people from all walks of life, and I feel a deep and stirring sense of purpose in my global health work. I am empowered and proud of my contributions, but I also experience humility at a level that transforms me. I am blessed that I have found my passion, one that combines my intellectual curiosity, determination, and my moral compass. I am optimistic for the future and the journey that lies ahead, as I do everything in my power to make basic healthcare a reality for the world.",1,2.626008654,2.927551654,3.159073004,3.541029009,3.100306294,10.0,17.0,21.0,24.0,19.0
C0,294,"As the Ebola epidemic ravaged West Africa in 2014, I was halfway through high school and oblivious to the devastation wrought half a world away. But when I stumbled upon a documentary about the outbreak, I was shocked and horrified by the images of suffering, isolation, and death. Flipping through news clips and imageries, I was moved by the intense challenge of responding to a crisis that’s so isolating, infectious, and terrifying. It was then I realized the enormous power of public health to combat Ebola and related pandemics, and my deep determination to make a difference. On reflecting over my own life experiences, it’s clear that public health is tied to almost everything that makes us human: food, shelter, air and water. So naturally, I was intrigued. Drawing from neuroscience to statistics to political science, I enrolled in every course available in public health that offered insights into fighting Ebola. I also joined a WHO(M9)-supported public health advocacy campaign, when I received the opportunity. As an integral part of the WHO(M9)-team, I helped with translating health educational flyers and awareness posters into local languages used in Guinea and Sierra Leone, Liva and Krio respectively. I was overwhelmed by the complexity of the cause; how do you fight an invisible, deadly enemy that spreads as fast as this virus without losing humanity? How do you promote positive human behavior, such as not washing their dead at funerals, ensure quality health care delivery, and improve access to medical resources, while simultaneously containing the spread? To achieve these objectives, there’s a special type of coordination that’s required—of global and local governments, businesses and foundations, charities and NGOs, clinics and hospitals, communities and families. But I believe that as a public health researcher, I can bridge this gap and make a significant impact. As a result, I have honed my research abilities and investigative skills, taking every opportunity to study epidemiology, microbiology and Immunology, even beyond the constraints of high school. At the end of 2019, the world was hit not just by the increasing Ebola epidemics in the DRC, but also by a novel strain of Coronavirus. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests that in the three months since the outbreak was first identified, it has infected more than two million people across the globe, resulting in over 100,000 deaths, with every country in the world now affected. The response to the pandemic took center stage; the importance of public health was once again highlighted, with the majority of the measures implemented focused on promoting public health-related guidance. This is amid the bigger picture that demonstrates how a disease outbreak has the capacity to disrupt the functioning of the most developed countries in the world. The importance of strategic research and adequate implementation of solutions, through precision interventions and behavior modification, has never been more apparent. At this point in our global history, there's no doubt that there will be more outbreaks, epidemics and pandemics that will require the collective and collaborative response of different stakeholders within and outside the health domain. This threat is what inspires me to pursue a career in public health research. I am preparing myself for the challenge by currently enrolling in a rigorous program, centered on developing a strong foundation in hard scientific skills, with insight into the socio-political dimensions of the field. This semester, I was admitted to the research program, a public research institution that plays a critical role in elucidating mechanisms of pathogenesis, transmission and control of various infectious diseases. There, I will have the opportunity to support Ebola-related research efforts and learn from the current projects underway. I believe that it's this type of research that, in combination with work in response and preparedness, will make the difference, and ultimately lead to the end of diseases like Ebola, COVID-19 and others in the future. The end of the Ebola epidemic starkly showed us what's possible when there's a coordinated global approach, bringing together an international group of experts, dedicated professionals, funders and governments, but also people who were affected by the scourge. And it showed us that we have more in common than we often think, that we are more a global community than a separate population. As I pursue the interests of the public health field, I know I will encounter challenges on this journey. But I am motivated to continue tackling these challenges head-on. And as we all fight against the Covid-19 pandemic with the tools at our disposal, I know that the potential for public health, within and beyond the limits of the conventional “health domain,” has never been greater. And in my mind, it’s the merging of scientific rigor with the power of networks and communities that will make a significant difference for better public health outcomes in the years to come. Public health offers perhaps the most exciting fields through which to create lasting positive change, for all people, no matter their location, station, or background. It’s one of the few arenas where a high school student can make a real impact on the world.",0,2.962730366,3.381578195,3.751160808,3.899194741,3.511292594,19.0,25.0,27.2,32.2,26.0
C1,295,"As a graduating senior with a passion for global health, I am determined to pursue a career in public health research. Growing up, I was largely unaware of the complexities of public health crises such as Ebola and COVID-19. However, as I learned more about these outbreaks, I became fascinated by the power of public health to combat them, and by the complexities involved in doing so. My interest in public health began when I learned about the Ebola epidemic in West Africa in 2014. As a result of the crisis, thousands of people were dying alone without access to basic medical care, and I was heartbroken by the images of suffering and death that I saw. I resolved to use my knowledge and resources to help, and I began researching and preparing to work in doctors without borders, hoping that I could contribute to ending the epidemic. However, upon researching and reading up more about the epidemic, I decided that the best way to have a widespread impact was through public health research. To this end, I took every public health course available to me and joined a healthcare advocacy campaign facilitated by the World Health Organization (WHO), where I created and translated health educational and awareness posters and flyers for Guinea and Sierra Leone. Even beyond the scope of high school, I have continued to study epidemiology, microbiology, and immunology to expand my knowledge base. As I now prepare for the next phase of my career in public health, I am enrolling in a rigorous research program centered on developing a strong foundation in hard scientific skills as well as insight into the socio-political dimensions of the field, to help me execute well thought computational models and solutions for health crises. More so, as the world currently battles with the COVID-19 pandemic, I will like to contribute to the research, innovation, and adaptation of strategies to the crisis. As I reflect on my interest in public health, I'm reminded of the importance of strategic research, precision interventions, and behavior modification for diseases like Ebola, COVID-19, and other potential future outbreaks, considering that any disease outbreak has the capacity to disrupt even the most developed countries in the world. I believe that there is a need for a combined effort in all these areas, which will make a significant difference, and ultimately lead to the end of diseases like Ebola, COVID-19, and others in the future. The public health field offers perhaps the most exciting opportunity to create lasting positive change for people all over the world, regardless of their location or background, and I'm thrilled to be a part of that change. Although I know this journey will be challenging, I'm motivated to tackle these challenges head-on and make a meaningful impact in the field. The end of the Ebola epidemic and current COVID-19 pandemic, both showed us what's possible when there's a coordinated global approach, bringing together an international group of experts, dedicated professionals, funders, and governments. As I move forward on this path, I believe that the merging of scientific rigor with the power of networks and communities will make a significant difference in improving public health outcomes worldwide. Nothing excites me more than the idea of contributing to public health research in meaningful ways that bridge the gap between people, stakeholders, and healthcare systems. In the future, I hope to become a leader in the field of public health, tackling the challenges posed by infectious diseases and other public health crises, promoting preventative and long-term solutions, and improving global health outcomes. By doing so, not only will I gain immeasurable fulfillment and satisfaction, but I will be making a lasting impact on people's lives, which is, after all, the most important work one can do.",0,3.281426126,3.444035652,3.621463001,3.934995338,3.559743269,22.6,27.6,33.0,37.0,31.5
C2,296,"The sun was beating down on the cracked pavement of the Liberian streets. The air was thick with the scent of sweat and I could hear the chorus of insects buzzing loudly in my ears. As I made my way through the crowded streets, I noticed a group of local health workers gathered under a tree, discussing the latest Ebola outbreak. The sense of urgency in their voices was palpable, and I was struck by their determination and resilience. Their bravery in the face of such a deadly outbreak was a testament to the importance of strong local health systems. I witnessed firsthand the critical role that these workers played in containing the virus, despite the overwhelming lack of resources and medical supplies. Their knowledge of the local customs and history allowed them to dispel myths and rumors about the disease and gain the trust of those most affected. My interest in global health began to take root as I watched the Ebola outbreak from afar. I became fascinated by the interconnected nature of global health and how it affects us all. It's not just about the spread of infectious diseases, but also about addressing the underlying social determinants of health that lead to disparities such as poverty, discrimination, and inequality. When I was invited to work alongside local health workers in Liberia, I jumped at the opportunity. I had long dreamed of becoming a public health practitioner, and this was my chance to gain practical experience and learn more about the complex issues of global health. As I began my work in Liberia, I was struck by the resilience and strength of the local communities. Despite the skepticism and misunderstanding surrounding the outbreak, they remained steadfast in their efforts to protect their loved ones from the virus. I was honored to work alongside them, offering my limited assistance wherever I could. While the Ebola outbreak in West Africa was a tragic event, it highlighted the need for a coordinated international response. The global health infrastructure is essential, but it cannot stand alone. We need to support the local communities and health systems that are most affected by public health crises. My experiences in Liberia taught me that true progress cannot be made in isolation. Medicines and technology can be crucial, but they cannot do the work alone. It takes the determination and resourcefulness of the local communities to make a lasting impact. I hold those memories dear and hope that they will guide me in the future. I believe that my multidisciplinary background in political science, global affairs, and public health makes me uniquely equipped to tackle the complex challenges of global health. Combining these fields, I plan to address the root causes of health disparities and develop innovative solutions to prevent and cure diseases. By promoting a more equitable and collaborative approach to global health, I hope to make a lasting impact on the world. In conclusion, global health remains one of the most pressing issues we face today. I am honored to have had the opportunity to work alongside local health workers in Liberia and witness their resilience in the face of such a deadly outbreak. I learned that effective global health solutions must be grounded in the needs of local communities and health systems. My passion for public health and my belief in the power of multidisciplinary approaches led me to pursue a degree in public health, with the goal of transforming the lives of those most affected by health disparities. I believe that, with sustained effort and unwavering commitment to equity, we can make healthcare accessible and a reality for everyone in the world.",0,2.882156961,3.103137641,3.293275119,3.562497831,3.254526188,14.8,18.0,21.4,26.0,19.5
H,297,"One day this year, as I was walking by my perpetually empty locker, I was struck by an idea. I cannot identify what sparked its conception, but as my idea started to grow, thinking of possible solutions and analyzing and assessing feasibility issues began to consume me. My father calls this a “designer’s high,” and it was very familiar to me. I’ve experienced it often while collaborating with my robotics team, and in the hours I’ve spent with my father on design concepts for his prefabricated homes. Still, nothing I had worked on before was similar to the feeling this “out of the box” idea had triggered. Growing strawberries in a high school locker seemed fairly simple at first. Despite knowing that this is not the typical habitat for strawberry plants, I knew from my green-thumbed mother that strawberries are among the easiest fruits to grow. Many students and teachers became interested in my project, yet were skeptical of my botanical prowess and quick to conclude that a plant could not possibly receive its basic necessities in a locker, which didn’t have proper ventilation, was hot and humid, and was shielded from both sunlight and any source of water. Still, I was determined to make this work. The unfriendly habitat and logistical obstacles did not deter me. My horticultural roots stem from my mother and elementary level biology. It wasn’t until this year that my knowledge expanded beyond this casual level into a realm where biology, chemistry, and physics found beautiful, synergistic intersections. I was determined to apply what I had learned and got to work. Due to the lack of electricity and direct sunlight, I decided to use a solar panel paired with a light sensor on the outside of my locker to power a strong, blue LED light, which is best for photosynthesis and plant growth. A friend taught me how to solder and helped me create the solar panel setup, which turns on the blue light only when it is dark outside so the plants experience the proper light cycles. I also set up a system to slowly water the plants automatically. This involved a series of drip bottles—which another friend had for his old, now deceased, pet guinea pig—arranged to drip into each other and then onto the soil. Having addressed the issues of light and water, I focused on the need to circulate air. Leaving the door closed would provide essentially no circulation and would create a hot and moist environment, making the plants more susceptible to mold. After experimenting with various designs and a 3D printed prototype, I came up with an extension of the latching mechanism on the inside of my locker, which I called the “strawberry jamb.” The jamb, which I cut using our school’s CNC router, sufficiently boosts airflow by allowing the door to remain ajar about two inches while still maintaining the integrity of the existing locking mechanism. I made a beautiful wooden box, emblazoned with the laser-cut engraving “Strawberry Fields Forever” and provided proper drainage onto a tray inside the locker to avoid water damage to school property. The strawberry plants are now growing in my partially open locker providing a topic of conversation and much commentary from students walking by. What began as a seemingly improbable idea fed my passion for creative thinking and mechanical engineering. This project not only allowed me to practically apply isolated academic principles I had studied, but it also pushed me to traverse multiple disciplines to creatively solve problems. Furthermore, it’s uniqueness beckoned for community input and collaboration, allowing me to access resources to achieve fiscally responsible solutions and ultimate success. For me, it was invigorating to propel a project that many deemed impossible into the realm of possible. I intend to continue to explore and invent because only then are new realities possible.",1,2.673412108,2.832484176,3.352610502,3.631550838,3.262945867,13.2,18.4,24.6,28.0,22.0
C0,298,"As I stepped onto the high school campus on the first day of freshman year, I was overwhelmed by the vast expanse of greenery and fields extending into the horizon. Having grown up in the bustling city, I was overjoyed at the prospect of attending a rural high school with a focus on agricultural studies. I couldn't wait to explore the farmlands and woods while immersing myself in the study of agriculture. Little did I know that my passion for agriculture would manifest in unexpected ways, in the form of a strawberry patch. When a group of students proposed the idea of growing strawberries in the school gardens, I was intrigued by the prospect of participating in the project. Despite having no prior experience with gardening, I eagerly joined the group and began learning the art of crop cultivation. The first few weeks were challenging, as we battled extreme heat and insufficient rainfall. Several of the plants wilted and withered, and we struggled to identify the cause of the problem. However, with perseverance and research, we eventually managed to stabilize the growth rates and began witnessing promising results. The plants were thriving and producing berries, and we were ecstatic with our progress. As the months progressed, I began to realize the true value of our strawberry patch. While we were primarily focused on the practical goal of producing fruit, the garden also served as a hub for learning, collaboration, and community engagement. The project brought together a diverse group of students, each with their unique skills and perspectives. We collaborated and brainstormed ideas, learning about each other's backgrounds and interests. The garden also served as a platform for community engagement, with several individuals and organizations visiting our school to witness the project and offer support. Through the garden, I also discovered the beauty of cycles and systems. I learned how even the tiniest of organisms have a vital role to play in the functioning of ecosystems and the importance of sustainability in agriculture. These lessons were not confined to the garden but started permeating into my daily life. I began to appreciate the importance of recycling and conserving resources, reducing my carbon footprint, and making conscious choices. The experience also allowed me to develop a sense of leadership and responsibility. As the project progressed, I became increasingly involved in managing and overseeing the cultivation process. I learned how to delegate tasks, create schedules, and manage resources. I also took responsibility for setbacks and learned to take constructive criticism and feedback from team members. These skills have been invaluable, not just in the garden, but in my academic and personal life. The strawberry patch has also had a significant impact on my career aspirations. Before joining the project, I was unsure of what career path to pursue. However, the experience has sparked an interest in sustainable agriculture and environmental management, and I am now actively considering pursuing a career in the field. I have begun research internships and have volunteered with local organizations working towards improving access to organic farming and sustainable agriculture. Reflecting on my journey with the strawberry patch, I realize that it is a microcosm of life. The path to success is not straightforward; it is filled with challenges, setbacks, and periods of stagnation. The key is to remain resilient and persistent and learn from failures to come back stronger. Surrounding oneself with a supportive community of individuals with a shared goal is crucial, as each person brings their unique skills and perspectives to the table. One must also remain mindful of the impact of their actions and strive towards sustainability and conservation. In conclusion, the experience of growing strawberries in high school has been transformative in ways that I could not have imagined. It has taught me resilience, collaboration, leadership, and responsibility while fostering an interest in environmental management and sustainable agriculture. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this project and look forward to applying the lessons learned in my future endeavors.",0,2.769453319,2.932676012,3.212541354,3.428790108,3.035295161,14.0,17.0,19.0,25.0,17.0
C1,299,"Growing strawberries in a locker may seem like a bizarre idea, but for me, it was the only option. As a senior in high school, I had an extensive list of extracurricular activities, including gardening. However, the recent pandemic made it impossible for me to continue with my passion for gardening, so I improvised and decided to grow strawberries in a re-purposed locker. The experience gave me a new perspective on resilience and determination that has now impacted everything else in my life. The concept of growing strawberries in a locker seemed impossible at first, but I knew that anything was possible with hard work and determination. In contrast to an actual garden, I had limited space and unconventional conditions. Therefore, I studied the best way to grow strawberries in unconventional conditions, and soon enough, I realized that I needed to tackle the problem methodically. The lack of direct light initially seemed like a significant problem considering that strawberries require abundant sunlight. However, I understood that with the right tools, I could create a conducive environment for the plants to flourish. One of the biggest challenges I faced in making a conducive environment was the need for regulating temperature and humidity levels. The locker I used was known to be hotter than other types of storage units. After some research, I decided to use a solar panel combined with a light sensor to power the lights in the locker, ensuring the ideal temperature for the plants. I also installed an air circulation system to keep air flowing in and out of the locker, maintaining constant humidity levels necessary for the plants. The joys of gardening have become a medicinal balm, especially during the pandemic, where many students have been stuck at home. Gardening helped me find comfort against the pandemic's anxiety, and a project like growing strawberries in a locker made it more exhilarating. As new complexities presented themselves, it was equally satisfying to come up with equally in-depth solutions. With each passing day, the strawberry plants grew stronger, and the vibrant red strawberries popped up on the bushier plants; I felt accomplished in my ability to bring the project to fruition. More than that, I felt proud that I overcame my reservations and misconceptions about my abilities to turn an outlandish idea into a reality. The lessons I learned from the experience transformed all facets of my life. It taught me that through resilience and persistence, even in a confined space, one can achieve incredible, unexpected things. The sensation of empowering myself and seeing a project that I created with my own thoughts flourish has left a deep impact on my psyche. As I look forward to attending Yale or Harvard, I am grateful for the lessons I learned from growing strawberries in a locker. College life has its unique challenges, but with dedication, determination, and hard work, I believe I can surmount any hurdle placed in my path. I have learned that life is unpredictable, and we must learn to adapt to changes, yet staying fixated on our vision and aiming at success. Overall, the experience of growing strawberries in a locker has taught me resilience, determination, and persistence. It's easy to feel constrained by our environment and conventional thinking, but when we think creatively and open ourselves to new possibilities, our potential to achieve incredible things is limitless. I am eager to bring this bold and imaginative approach to Yale or Harvard, using it to not only gain a cutting-edge education but also bring exciting perspectives to both campuses. Above all, I look forward to continuing to challenge myself and learning an incredible life lesson from each opportunity that arises.",0,2.843186681,3.030988162,3.16106039,3.388778403,3.117020022,16.4,20.8,24.0,25.0,21.5
C2,300,"The scent of strawberries enveloped me whenever I opened the locker to check on them. Their ripening fragrance mixed with the metallic smell of the locker, creating a unique blend that filled my nostrils to the brim. It was an aroma that held the promise of success, an opportunity to taste the sweetness that could be mine if I continued with my crazy attempts at unconventional gardening. A small victory in harvesting the fruits of my labor in such an unexpected locale. Dirt and water were my closest companions that year. The soil felt alive, and the way it crumbled between my fingers made me feel alive too. The sound of soil slipping through my fingers was one of the most satisfying sounds I have ever heard - serene and calming. It was a sound that calmed my frazzled nerves and gave me a sense of control that was missing from other aspects of my life. Certainly, it was hard work to tend to the plants, and there were times when everything seemed overwhelming. There were moments when I looked at the small locker with its green seedlings and wondered if my effort was worth it. But every time I saw a new shoot appear, every time a new plant sprouted, I knew it was all worth it. The strawberries were growing in a tight space, but their delicate stems still found a way to reach towards the light, straining with all their might to emerge out of the constraints of the locker. As I looked upon the fruits of my labor, I couldn't help but think of the obstacles that all living things had to face, big or small. Although the strawberries always had their roots planted in one box, they still grew, adapted, and flourished as if in a field of freedom. They grew the same way that I had grown and adapted to my environment - by seeking out creative solutions whenever conventional methods failed. The feeling of triumph that coursed through me upon completion of this project was unmatchable. It was one of the few moments in my life when everything seemed right in the world. It was an extension of myself that refused to be silenced or cast aside because of the boundaries of space or possibility. The strawberries that I nurtured in that locker were proof of my perseverance and reminded me that a goal is not a far-fetched dream until every effort is spent. That experience taught me that we all have the potential to achieve amazing things, even with limitations or less than perfect conditions. It showed me that, given the right motivation, we can overcome any challenge and succeed in our endeavors. The project taught me to think outside the box to achieve something great, and to keep trying even when things look bleak. As I look forward to attending Yale or Harvard, I see myself carrying this passion for persevering through every step of my journey. I believe that, with the same determination and commitment, I can achieve anything I set my mind to. I am ready to meet new challenges and experience everything that college life has to offer, knowing that the lessons learned from the strawberry project will form the bedrock of my approach. In conclusion, growing strawberries inside a locker set me down a path of unexpected challenges and exhilarating success. Through this unconventional gardening project, I learned the value of persistence, resilience, and determination. I realized that even when things seem impossible, there's still a way to achieve incredible things by refusing to give up. The strawberry locker was more than just plants growing in a confined space; it was an experience that transformed the way I look at life and approach every obstacle. Together with the skills and knowledge I've gained through this project, I believe that Yale or Harvard will present exciting new opportunities for growth and achievement. With the same persistence and resilience, I will carry these values with me as I progress to a bright future.",0,2.692810216,2.869936405,2.915499073,3.231779852,2.911134231,17.0,21.0,22.0,26.0,22.0
H,301,"The most exciting time to live in Vermont is mid-February. This is the time when one is given the privilege of a 30-minute walk to school in sub-zero temperatures, with a 30-minute trudge home in the dark after a long day. It’s been four months since winter began, and it’ll be two more until it’s over. The firewood is being rationed to keep the house at a barely livable temperature, a steamy 50 degrees, and colds are so rampant that people lose half their body weight in phlegm each day. Yet, however dull Vermont may seem to students and teachers as they wrap themselves in layer after layer of flannel, make no mistake, today is the beginning of an era. Today is the day when Isaac (that’s me) starts his job of putting smiles on grim faces as the reader of the morning announcements. “But Isaac, that job is super boring! You just read what’s written on a piece of paper,” is what an uninformed person might say, someone who obviously doesn’t know about my passion for annoying the tired and melancholic with smiling positivity. While expression and humor has not historically been a part of this process, and while ad-libbing has been strictly advised against, I go for it anyway. And why not? The worst possible outcome involves only a stern lecture and an expulsion from the job. Fortunately, there is not much going on this week, which means I have some wiggle room with what I can say. The loud buzz of the intercom whines throughout the school, and the silent apprehension of the day is met, somewhat unexpectedly, with a greeting of 20 “yo’s” and a long, breathy pause. I artfully maneuver someone else’s writing into my own words, keeping the original intent but supplementing the significant lack of humor with a few one-liners. I conclude by reminding everyone that just because the weather is miserable today does not mean that we have to be as well. Luckily, the principal loves it. And despite the fact that I urge everyone to interrupt my history teacher’s classes to wish him a happy birthday, I get to keep my job for another day. I have people coming up to me left and right, telling me that I made them smile. When I hear that, I smile back. For the rest of the month, I work to make sure that people hear my message: even though we are at the time when school and winter are beginning to seem endless, there are still reasons to grin. I urge people to attend basketball games or sign up for spring sports. I announce birthdays and other special events. Before every day, I make sure I have a message that will make people think, “you know, today might not be so bad after all.” After my month ends, the announcements have been changed. The next readers tell jokes or riddles, or sing songs and invite others to sing with them. I watch the announcements evolve from an unfortunate but necessary part of the day to a positive and inspiring event. It is now more than just a monotonous script; it becomes a time to make sure that everyone has at least one thing to smile about. Life shouldn’t have to be a dreary winter day; it should be the satisfaction of a good saxophone solo or the joy of seeing one’s friends every day at school. It is the enthusiasm of a biology teacher, the joy of a sports victory, and even the warm messages of a disembodied voice on the intercom. I use that message to help freshman feel less nervous at their first race or to encourage my friend to continue taking solos in jazz band. And in the most dismal time of year, I use that message in the daily announcements.'",1,2.535511321,2.812028501,3.160895954,3.316745595,2.870963583,12.4,18.8,26.0,30.2,23.5
C0,302,"As I sat in my bedroom on a rainy afternoon, I felt my mood start to drop. The sound of raindrops tapping against my window was almost hypnotic, lulling me into a state of melancholy. But as the minutes ticked by, I realized that I had a choice: I could let the dreary weather dictate my emotions, or I could bring my own positivity to the day. This realization is something I've been working on for years. As someone who has struggled with anxiety and depression, I've become all too familiar with the feeling of being weighed down by negativity. But over time, I've developed strategies for bringing positivity to my life, no matter what the external circumstances may be. And I've realized that these strategies are not just useful for me, but for everyone around me. One of the key ways I bring positivity to dreary days is through gratitude. It's easy to get caught up in what's going wrong in our lives, but taking a moment to focus on what's going right can be transformative. When I feel my mood starting to drop, I'll make a list of things I'm grateful for, no matter how small they may seem. Maybe it's the fact that I have a roof over my head and food to eat, or that I have a loving family and friends who support me. By focusing on these positive aspects of my life, I'm able to shift my mindset and see the world in a more hopeful light. Another way I bring positivity to dreary days is through connection. When I'm feeling down, it can be tempting to isolate myself and wallow in my own negative emotions. But I've found that reaching out to others, even in small ways, can make a huge difference. Maybe I'll send a text to a friend I haven't spoken to in a while, or strike up a conversation with a stranger at the grocery store. By focusing on the connections I have with others, I'm able to feel less alone and more hopeful about the world around me. Finally, I bring positivity to dreary days by seeking out beauty. This can take many forms: listening to music that lifts my spirits, taking a walk in nature, or even just looking at a piece of art that inspires me. By focusing on the beauty around me, I'm able to tap into a sense of awe and wonder that transcends my immediate circumstances. And in doing so, I'm able to remind myself that there is still so much good in the world, even on the darkest of days. Of course, these strategies aren't foolproof. There are still times when the weight of negativity feels too heavy to shake off, and I find myself sinking into despair. But even in those moments, I've learned to be gentle with myself and to remember that tomorrow is a new day, full of new opportunities for positivity and growth. Bringing positivity to dreary days isn't just important for our own mental health – it's also important for the people around us. When we radiate positivity, we have the power to lift others up and create a ripple effect of hope and joy. This is something I've experienced firsthand in my own life. When I'm feeling positive and energized, I'm able to be a better friend, daughter, and community member. I'm more patient, more compassionate, and more willing to lend a helping hand. And in doing so, I'm able to create a more positive and connected world for us all. As I prepare to enter the next chapter of my life as a college student, I know that there will be many dreary days ahead. But I also know that I have the tools and the mindset to bring positivity to those days, and to help others do the same.

C1,303,"The morning announcements were just another mundane aspect of high school life - a monotonous ritual that students tuned out before the day had even begun. Yet, I refused to accept that it had to be this way. I believed that the regular announcement slots presented an untapped source of positivity and connection that could benefit the entire student body. This belief led me to pitch the idea of a “positivity segment” to my school administrators, an idea that would change school culture for the better. At first, the segment merely served as another conveniently ignored part of the morning routine. Despite our best efforts to share uplifting news stories and quotes, most students were too preoccupied with their upcoming classes to pay attention. We knew that we had to create more engagement if we were to make any significant impact. So we focused on interactivity. We created trivia games with prizes and scavenger hunts using clues shared throughout the week. We invited our classmates to share uplifting moments and stories over the intercom. Slowly but surely, more and more students began tuning in to the announcements, eager to hear what we had in store for them. Over time, the impact of our positivity segment began to show. Students reported feeling more engaged and positive at the start of the day, while teachers commented on the increase in participation and spirit. Parents reached out to us, expressing their gratitude for the significant impact we had had on their children's lives. But it wasn't until one Thursday morning that everything really clicked. After sharing an inspirational quote about the power of determination, we asked our classmates to share moments when they had overcome a difficult challenge through sheer perseverance. One student named Sophia bravely stepped forward to share her story. Sophia had always struggled with math, nearly failing her algebra course the year before. Yet she refused to give up and worked tirelessly with her teacher to improve her understanding of the subject. In an inspiring display of determination, she dedicated herself to after-school tutoring sessions and took extra quizzes until she finally earned a passing grade. As Sophia shared her story over the intercom, I saw dozens of students nodding along, relating to her struggle. But what was truly inspiring was the collective sense of admiration and respect that radiated from the school that day. Sophia's vulnerability in sharing her story had brought us all closer together, and her positive attitude had shown us the power of determination. It was then that I realized the true power of our morning positivity segments. By creating a space for students to share and connect, we had fostered an unprecedented sense of community and support. We had shown that positivity and kindness were contagious and that a little bit of effort could go a long way in making an extraordinary impact. As I now prepare to enter college, I take this sense of positivity and community with me. I know that even the smallest actions can lead to the greatest changes and I am determined to continue finding ways to make meaningful impacts wherever I go. Whether through community service, mentorship, or simply spreading kindness, I believe that I can make a difference thanks to the lessons I learned through something as simple as the morning announcements.",0,2.654948817,2.986850956,3.107804072,3.308842139,3.028397224,13.6,17.4,21.6,24.8,19.0
C2,304,"The hallways of high school can be quite loud and boisterous, with the sound of chatter and students rushing to their class or frantically trying to, at least. The anxiety that comes with such a hurried pace can transform into negativity. Procrastination and stress often lead to negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and even suicidal thoughts. As a high school senior, I've been fascinated by the idea of spreading positivity - a breath of fresh air that can make an impact in someone's life. Acts of kindness make a profound difference in someone's day, and a small gesture can turn someone's life around. One day, as I was walking through the hallway, I noticed a girl shivering from the cold. I immediately realized that I had an extra sweater in my backpack and offered it to her. The gesture was entirely unexpected and changed the way she viewed the world around her. It was as if the world had, for a moment, stood still so that we could share a moment of warmth and, more importantly, of positivity. The small exchange brought a smile to her face and a day of sunshine, even if moments before, all she felt was gloominess. Since then, I've made it my mission to spread positivity in high school. I no longer just walk through the hallways with my head down, thinking of my burdens. Instead, I see the burden of others and try to find creative ways of helping them surf through the waves of negativity that come their way. I've come to realize that positivity is a shared responsibility in the school environment, and every student can make an impact. Leading by example is a crucial aspect of spreading positivity in high school. We should encourage and help others whenever possible, genuinely and selflessly. Our interactions with others should not be exemplified by arrogance or disregard for others - attitudes that often lead to bullying or frowning upon someone because of their flaws or predicaments. We should model a culture that uplifts and values everyone, regardless of background or characteristics. A positive environment provides a sense of security and exposure to diversity and different perspectives, which aids in transforming the lives of teenagers who feel left out and isolated from the rest. To this end, I believe schools should initiate positivity clubs, special events, or even have happiness campaigns at school. For instance, hobbies like dancing can be used as a tool for a school club event or assemblies. By making the school environment inviting and encouraging, students feel safe and welcome, improving their mindset towards their education, academic work, and peers. It's not just a matter of creating a positive environment; it's also vital to combat cyberbullying. Social media has become the epicenter of cyberbullying, where people use different social media platforms to tarnish the emotional health of others. The internet has become rife with fun and games that seem harmless but turn into opportunities to mock, ridicule, and hurt others, leading to severe repercussions. Positivity can counteract cyberbullying by uplifting those who are going through rejections, failures, or negativity of any form. A kind word, a hug, or even just listening to someone's problems can make a significant impact. In conclusion, high school is a memorable and critical period in the lives of students. Cultivating a positive culture in school helps foster healthy, confident, and productive adults. Spreading positivity is a shared responsibility in the school environment, and every student can make an impact. We can perform acts of kindness, lead by example, create a positive environment, and combat cyberbullying. We can change the world one positive gesture at a time. The world needs more positivity, and it begins with us.",0,2.575455349,2.730712464,2.854459181,3.053128275,2.830052546,13.8,16.0,18.2,24.8,17.0
H,305,"Having explored the myths from ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt, my curiosity was piqued in eighth grade by a simple legend from Japanese lore. If you fold one thousand paper cranes, the gods will grant you one wish. I took it as a challenge. My previous forays into origami had ended poorly, but I was so excited to begin my quest that this detail seemed inconsequential. My art teacher loaned me a piece of origami paper and, armed with an online tutorial, my quest began. Like an early prototype of the airplane, I ascended towards my dreams for a glorious moment before nose-diving into the ground. The first crane was a disastrous failure of wrinkly lines and torn paper. Too embarrassed to ask for another, I turned to my stack of Post-it notes. By the third attempt, I ended up with a sticky pink paper crane. Holding that delicate bird, I was flooded with triumph and elation. The first two hundred cranes were all crafted from Post-it notes. Armed with a pack of highlighters, I decorated each piece of paper individually. I folded cranes at home, between classes, and in the car. My fingers were permanently sticky from the glue I scraped off every square. Slowly, my collection grew: first ten, then fifty, then one hundred. Before the task could become monotonous, I started experimenting. How small was it possible for a crane to be? Smaller than a golf ball? Smaller than a dime? Small enough to sit on the end of a pencil? Any size was attainable. I could make a crane smaller than almost any arbitrary form of measurement. Soon I could finish a crane in fifty seconds or with my eyes closed. Anything square and foldable became my medium. Paper towels, candy wrappers, and aluminum foil joined my vibrant menagerie of carefully folded paper. I was unstoppable; that wish was as good as mine. By six hundred cranes, the increasing demands of high school academics caused my pace to slow. I despaired. I wouldn’t let this be another ambitious project that I couldn’t finish. My cranes mattered to me. As an outlet for expression, they served as a way to defuse frustration and sadness, and a source of pride and joy. Their creation allows me to bring beauty to the world and to find a sense of order in the bustle and chaos of life. There is a lot of beauty to be found in tiny things. I’m reminded that little gestures have a lot of meaning. I have given away cranes to my friends as a pick-me-up on bad days, and I have made cranes to commemorate people, such as the dark green crane I made the day my grandmother died. They are a symbol of hope to remind me what I have accomplished. So, I pushed myself to keep working and to keep folding one crane at a time. My determination paid off, and in the summer after sophomore year, my passion was reinvigorated. One month before the end of junior year, I folded my thousandth paper crane. As I leaned over the open drawer brimming with origami pieces in a multitude of sizes and colors, I felt a rush of satisfaction and triumph. Not only was 1,000 cranes an achievement in its own right, but I proved to myself that I can finish what I start. The world is filled with big numbers. College tuition, monthly rent, and car prices deal in the many thousands. Those figures are incomprehensible to someone who has never interacted with anything so large, and I wanted to understand them. A thousand will never simply be a number to me: it is hundreds upon hundreds of hand-folded cranes combined with years of effort. So what did I wish for? It turns out, I didn’t need the wish. I learned I have the power to make things happen for myself.",1,2.193664704,2.569689166,2.757395978,3.03003925,2.700829663,8.4,11.8,13.2,19.6,13.0
C0,306,"Folding 1000 paper cranes, a task made famous by Sadako Sasaki, a young girl affected by the Hiroshima bombing, symbolized her hope for peace and a cure from her radiation illness. Growing up with Japanese heritage, I have always been familiar with this story, but never really understood its power until I took on the task for myself. I was inspired to fold 1000 paper cranes after reading the book Sadako and the Thousand Paper Cranes by Eleanor Coerr. It was assigned reading for my 7th-grade English class, and I remember feeling moved by how one person's story could make such a profound impact on others. Throughout the years, I stored these thoughts at the back of my mind, but it wasn't until the pandemic hit that I decided to take action and start folding. Stuck at home with no extracurricular activities, no social events, and a lot of free time, I decided that this was the perfect opportunity to take on the task of folding 1000 paper cranes. I started out small, folding five cranes a day, but soon found myself able to fold 20, then 50, then 100, as my skill and patience improved. As I continued folding, I realized that each crane represented not only my journey but also my family's struggle. I am a first-generation American, and being able to identify with my roots has always been important to me. As the daughter of immigrants, it feels even more important to maintain the traditions that were passed down to me. Folding 1000 paper cranes was not just a personal journey; it represented a connection to the past and to my family's history. But despite my familiarity with the story, I had never envisioned how physically and mentally demanding it would be to fold 1000 paper cranes. My fingers would get numb from the repetitive motion, and my back would ache from being hunched over a table for hours. There were times when I wanted to give up, but I knew that each crane I folded represented an obstacle in my life that I had overcome. It served as a reminder that anything is possible with enough effort and dedication. As I progressed with my project, I realized that there was more to the story of the 1000 paper cranes than just the physical act of folding. It was how the message of the cranes reached others and touched their lives that made the story truly powerful. Sadako's story made people empathize with a little girl they never met, and it inspired them to do something that would help not only her but also others who suffered from the effects of war. Folding 1000 paper cranes reminded me of something important: the power of storytelling. It reminded me that we all have stories to tell, and that sharing these stories can bring people together in ways we never thought possible. It made me think about the impact that our stories can have on others, and how one person's narrative can inspire a whole movement. As I neared the end of my journey, I realized that folding 1000 paper cranes was not just about me or my family, but about making a difference in the world. The power of one person's story is immeasurable, and I hope that my story of folding 1000 paper cranes can inspire others to take action, and to make a difference in their own communities. In a world that can feel so chaotic and uncertain, the simple act of folding 1000 paper cranes reminded me of the importance of hope, perseverance, and resilience. It reminded me that no matter how insurmountable a task may seem, we have the strength to overcome it if we stay dedicated to our goal. In conclusion, folding 1000 paper cranes has been a transformative experience for me. It has not only connected me to my family's heritage but also reminded me of the power of storytelling and the importance of hope, perseverance, and resilience. I hope that my story can inspire others to take on their own 1000 paper cranes challenge and to make a difference in their own lives and the lives of others. Like Sadako Sasaki, we should all strive to make a positive impact in the world, one crane at a time.",0,2.834155999,3.04012085,3.224152583,3.50135375,3.149453917,20.0,24.0,27.0,29.8,26.0
C1,307,"As someone who has always been fascinated with mythology and ancient legends, the story of the one thousand paper cranes from Japanese folklore has always had a special place in my heart. It is a story of resilience, determination, and the power of hope in the face of adversity. Inspired by this legend, I decided to embark on a personal challenge of my own: to fold one thousand paper cranes as a means of testing my own perseverance and patience. Like many others before me, my first attempts at folding a paper crane were disastrous. However, I refused to let my early failures discourage me, and with a little bit of help from my art teacher and an online tutorial, I gradually began to improve. At times, the task seemed insurmountable, but the thought of the one wish granted to those who achieved this goal always kept me going. As I progressed through my journey, I began to realize the true value of this challenge. Rather than focusing solely on the final goal of folding one thousand paper cranes, I found immense satisfaction in the incremental progress I was making every day. Each crane brought me one step closer to my ultimate goal, but more importantly, it taught me the value of perseverance, patience, and small victories. As I continued to fold cranes, I realized that this challenge was not only about mastering a new skill but also about learning how to approach difficult tasks in life. It taught me the importance of taking things one step at a time and breaking down complex problems into manageable chunks. It taught me the value of practice and the importance of learning from my mistakes. Most importantly, it showed me that if I could achieve this goal, then there was no limit to what I was capable of achieving in other areas of my life. In fact, the lessons I learned from this challenge served me well when I had to confront other difficult tasks in my life. The discipline, patience, and resilience that I had developed from folding one thousand paper cranes helped me to stay focused and motivated in the face of adversity. Whether it was studying for a difficult exam, working on a challenging project, or dealing with personal setbacks, these lessons gave me the strength to keep moving forward. As I reflect back on my journey of folding one thousand paper cranes, I am reminded of the words of the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle, who once said that 'We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.' This challenge taught me that success is not just about achieving big goals but rather about developing a mindset and a set of habits that enable us to succeed in any area of our lives. In conclusion, the journey of folding one thousand paper cranes has been a transformative experience for me. It has taught me the value of perseverance, patience, and resilience in the face of adversity. It has also inspired me to take on new challenges and to stay focused on my goals even when the going gets tough. I am grateful for this experience and for the lessons that it has taught me, and I look forward to carrying these lessons with me as I continue to strive for excellence in all areas of my life.",0,2.727152716,2.915078819,3.18384879,3.454196294,3.039417813,16.4,23.0,27.2,30.6,25.0
C2,308,"The sound of the paper rustling against my fingertips was a constant reminder of the task ahead. Each fold had to be perfect, precise, and purposeful. The texture of the paper, slightly rough against my skin, carried with it a sensation of warmth and familiarity. The smell of the paper, fresh and crisp, was a reminder that this journey was just beginning. As I sat at my desk, surrounded by piles of colorful paper, I felt a sense of excitement and anticipation. Folding 1000 paper cranes was no small task, but I was ready for the challenge. I knew that this journey was not just about the physical act of folding paper but about the lessons and memories that lay ahead. With each crane I folded, I felt a sense of accomplishment and pride. My fingers moved swiftly, the paper dancing in my hands as I carefully crafted each crane. The symbolism of the crane, representing youth and hope, felt alive in my hands as I worked tirelessly towards my goal. But as the journey continued, the act of folding paper became more than just a personal pursuit. It became a way to connect with my family's past, to maintain our traditions, and to honor those who came before us. I remember sitting with my grandmother, our hands delicately folding each crane together. The sound of her voice was calm and reassuring, the touch of her hand warm against mine. With each crane we folded, she shared stories of her youth, of a time long before I was born. The memories of those moments, of the laughter and love that we shared, are a constant reminder of the power of tradition. And as I continued to fold, I realized that this journey was not just about me or my family. It was about the impact that my story could have on others, about inspiring others to take action and make a difference. I remember one day when a classmate saw me working on my cranes and asked me what I was doing. I explained the tradition of folding 1000 paper cranes, and they were immediately fascinated. I could see the curiosity and wonder in their eyes, and I felt a sense of pride in sharing a piece of my culture with them. That moment, that exchange between two people from different worlds, reminded me of the power of storytelling. It reminded me of the importance of sharing our stories and traditions, of bridging the gaps that divide us. And as I sit here today, with 1000 paper cranes by my side, I know that my journey has just begun. It has given me a newfound appreciation for tradition, for the power of storytelling, and for the impact that one person's story can have on the world. So let these 1000 paper cranes be a symbol of hope, peace, and love. Let them fly far and wide, carrying with them a message of resilience and perseverance. And let my story be a reminder that no matter how hard the journey may seem, the light of hope will always guide us forward.",0,2.676303185,2.726476966,2.855593023,2.912726062,2.84038413,15.0,17.0,19.2,22.0,19.0
H,309,"M7652-000. Or at least that's how my bike-tire-greased, highlight-yellow, heel-cap-ripping-at-the-seams Chuck-Taylors are supposed to be colored. Freshman year, I tried so hard to keep them that pristine, popular M7652-000 color. Time progressed, however, and dirt, guitar chords, and conversations eventually covered the canvas of the shoes. When I first moved to Houston in eighth grade, I tried to follow the status quo and keep my shoes white. But as various conflicting influences crept into my life--Liberal vs. Conservative; Portland, OR vs. Houston, TX; LCD Sound system vs. Ed Sheeran--I began to realize how important it is to listen to the other side and to maintain the confidence to pursue my passions while inspiring others to do the same. I needed to appreciate Houston's voice and learn from its stories as much as it needed to hear mine, and my shoes grew dirtier every day as each person's testimony helped solidify and expand my own. As I walk, one can first make out 'Cheyenne yo yo' engulfing the right inner canvas, weaving through clasps and eventually boarding 'PORTLAND!!!' I met Cheyenne through Freshman year volleyball and we were friends because I tried; I borrowed cowboy boots for football games, didn't discuss my quirky music, and washed my shoes. As I grew, however, it was our differences that brought us together. She forced me to see the other side, forced me to make my own conclusions without the influence of my background or parents. In Portland, opinions are liberally voiced, and it's similar in my community in Houston, except rather than an abundance of Lizzie Fletcher stickers it's 'Come and Take It'. When I moved, I was bombarded by a completely foreign culture. By sophomore year, however, I realized that compromising myself in order to fit in was a mistake. I began vocally expressing my sentiments towards the world to my friends as I learned from theirs. While I introduced my friends to thrift-shopping and wrote articles about more environmentally friendly methods of transportation, they took me to my first line-dance and helped me examine the other side of gun-control in `Agora Coffee House'. As I grew more comfortable with expressing my beliefs, I began heading projects to install a bike rack around campus and took to writing more iconoclastic political pieces in English class. My left shoe houses various meme references, chords from songs I have written, sketches of the latest NASA star cluster discoveries, practice lines of Italian greetings from when I was set on learning it, and 'Lorrie Lake Ln.' in small cursive letters. Sandalwood, my friends and I call it--a late-night, post-fast food, teen-angst polluted lake. Sandalwood is the cosmos and the meaning of God and the Sisyphus-like emotions that we discuss there. I never knew that Mormons couldn't drink coffee or that Romanians gut an entire pig to feast on for all of winter. Their philosophies, although often dissonating from my own, taught me that it's often beneficial to disagree. When I was hurled into Texas, I was miserable when I didn't express myself within the Kinkaid-bubble. However, I quickly began to realize that I didn't have to like Ed Sheeran or keep my shoes M7652-000 to enjoy life. Learning to embrace and assess so many dissonating ideas has enabled to grow more into myself--it makes me more nonpartisan and has educated me on what it truly means to listen to the other side. Now, whether it's Texas or Oregon, Republican or Democrat, my life is a playlist of contradictions. In college, where everyone works on discovering 'who they are' or what their place is in the world, I know I can provide not only diversity of thought, but can educate people through my own stories on how crucial it is to maintain an open-minded ideology towards the world and an individual's power to change it.",1,2.687443556,2.932361174,3.163058721,3.616787196,2.987081723,14.4,17.0,22.2,33.4,19.0
C0,310,"As a young child growing up in a predominantly homogenous community, my perspective of the world was limited. I never imagined that there was something beyond my surroundings. However, this monotony changed when I had the chance to attend a multi-cultural festival. As I gazed across the crowds, it struck me that there were countless ethnicities, cultures, and languages. The community was alive- thriving, yet not one person looked entirely the same. I was fascinated and at the same time, intimidated. This enchanting experience opened my eyes and put me on a journey of embracing diversity and open-mindedness. Growing up, my parents always taught me to be respectful to everyone, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, or culture. Diverse individuals always intrigued me, and I would often ask many questions to understand what life was like for them. I couldn't imagine living the same way they did, but that didn't stop me from creating friendships with people from different backgrounds. However, this idyllic image of the world was challenged when I started high school. My experience at school was not as welcoming as I had anticipated. Friendships were based solely on ethnicity and cultural likeness, and individuals who didn't fit that mold were left out. It was frustrating to see that people were so closed-minded and refused to embrace diversity, even when it was within their reach. I was determined to change this atmosphere. When I became a member of my school's diversity and inclusion club, I was excited. It was the perfect outlet to channel my frustrations and bring about change. However, it was harder than I expected. Most club members had different agendas, and coming to a consensus on what we wanted to achieve seemed impossible. It wasn't until we began to have open and honest conversations that we realized that we all shared the same goal- to create an inclusive school environment. Our first project as a team was creating a video that showcased our school's diversity. We went out and surveyed students from different backgrounds, asking them what it meant to them to be in a culturally diverse school. It was an eye-opener. Despite coming from different worlds, everyone had a common goal of wanting acceptance, respect, and understanding from their peers. We worked hard on the video and presented it to the entire school. The feedback was overwhelming, and there was a noticeable change in the school's atmosphere. It was now easier to approach someone who wasn't from your cultural background and strike up a conversation. Since then, we have implemented several initiatives that have brought students together. We hold an annual culture day, where students showcase food, clothing, and music from their cultural backgrounds. It's inspiring to see students come together to appreciate each other's traditions and learn from one another. In addition, we have established study groups where students from different academic backgrounds can come together to help each other. It's incredible how something as simple as studying together can bridge the gap between cultures. My experience in high school has taught me that diversity thrives where open-mindedness is cultivated. Being open-minded means being willing to listen, learn, and understand other people's opinions, beliefs, and cultural practices. It's not about losing one's identity or values but taking the time to appreciate other people's traditions, languages, and values. Embracing diversity and open-mindedness take time and effort. It requires us to break down our preconceptions of the world and see things through the eyes of other people. It's about acknowledging that each person's story is unique, and we can all learn something from one another. I am proud to have been a part of creating an inclusive environment in my high school. Our initiatives have brought diverse groups of students together, and it's inspiring to witness the growth and understanding that has come from it. As I prepare to apply to college, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead. While college is a place to expand my academic knowledge, I am eager to meet people from all over the world with different customs and ideas. I know it won't be easy; stepping out of my comfort zone never is, but I am up for the challenge. I dream of being part of a community that celebrates diversity and inclusivity, where individuals' ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds are embraced and respected. Embracing diversity and open-mindedness is crucial, now more than ever. Our world is becoming increasingly diverse, and as the next generation, we must commit to creating places where diversity thrives. As I reflect on my journey of embracing diversity, I am reminded that it's the little things that create a big impact. It's about the conversations we have with one another, the initiatives we undertake, and the differences we embrace with open arms. I would like Yale or Harvard to know that through my experiences, I have become a champion for diversity and inclusivity. I am confident that I have the skills, passion, and drive to contribute to any community I become a part of.",0,2.599980742,2.703228364,2.814188906,3.020726013,2.771361388,13.0,16.6,19.0,21.0,17.0
C1,311,"The way my dirty, scuffed Chuck-Taylors looked like was once a significant concern to me. However, my perspective opened up when I moved to Houston from my previous homogenous community. My racial identity, political views, and music tastes were all different from what I encountered in Houston. I realized then that it is crucial to embrace diversity and listen to the other side. As I became more comfortable with embracing and expressing my differences in Houston, I began to realize that it is essential to be open to other people's opinions without compromising oneself. High school was not as inclusive as one would think, but with joining the diversity and inclusion club, I started working on making a change. I learned that open conversations, regardless of our ethnicity or cultural background, could bridge the gap between cultures, making for a more inclusive environment. Our team created a video showcasing the diverse culture and traditions, and the feedback we received was heartwarming. It was incredible to see how much a simple celebration of diverse cultures could do to bring people together. We also initiated study groups where students of varying academic backgrounds could come together and learn from one another. Throughout high school, I have come to realize that embracing diversity and open-mindedness can make a huge difference, just like a ripple in water can create waves. I have come to appreciate that diversity nourishes open-mindedness, making it possible for us to learn from others, irrespective of their ethnic, cultural, or religious background. It means taking the time to understand customs, defy preconceptions, and learn from one another, and being confident in our identity while respecting others. Now, as I prepare to apply to institutions like Yale or Harvard, I dream of attending a place that celebrates diversity and inclusivity, where differences are embraced, and respect is given to every individual's background. I'm well-equipped with skills, passion, and an eagerness to learn, and I believe any environment that embraces diversity and open-mindedness will enable me to grow as a person and help others grow, too. In a world increasingly becoming diversified, it's more important than ever to embrace each other's differences to make cultural, social and emotional progress. I have learned that being open to differing opinions, customs, and traditions, however, challenging that might be, can create lasting bonds that cut across ethnic, cultural, and socioeconomic barriers. In conclusion, my high school experience has shown me that it's the small things that matter. Conversations that make us uncomfortable, but challenge our perceptions, initiatives, and stories that help us appreciate diversity, inclusivity, and open-mindedness.

C2,312,"The strum of my guitar strings and the taste of my mom's homemade chicken pot pie was a staple in my hometown. However, when I moved to New York City, everything was different. The honking of cars, the smell of pretzels on the street corners, and even the yellow cabs' texture was something I had never encountered before. It was then that I realized that experiencing new things, cultures, and traditions were vital in shaping a diverse outlook on life. As a high school senior, I have come to understand that embracing diversity is essential. Growing up, I attended schools where everyone looked, spoke, and thought the same way. But after moving to New York, I was surrounded by various cultures and traditions, which inspired my openness and love for diversity. I learned to love different things, including the Malay sweets I tasted in China Town and the various dialects spoken by the people around me. This experience encouraged me to become comfortable with who I am, while also learning about others, despite our differences. I understood that it could be challenging to bridge these differences. However, I became passionate about learning and exploring the unique cultures that surrounded me in NYC. I became a part of a program to mentor underprivileged children, where I found that despite our cultural differences, we could still connect and bond. With time, I began to understand that fostering diversity is not only essential for a thriving community but also vital for creating a peaceful and successful world. I also immersed myself in an intercultural book club where we read books from different cultures, celebrating the diverse authors' work. We discussed their stories and cultures, which expanded my understanding and appreciation of other cultures. This experience taught me the power of creativity, which can connect and bring understanding to seemingly different worlds. I realized from this experience that storytelling has the power to transcend boundaries and ultimately create a more tolerant and connected world. As I prepare my application to Ivy League institutions, I dream of attending a place that embraces diversity and promotes inclusivity, a place where differences are valued and celebrated, and individuals of all backgrounds feel comfortable. A place where everyone who comes in has an equal chance of thriving, developing, and growing. In this era of globalization, I understand the importance of creating an environment that can support multiple cultures, an environment that remains open to different traditions, customs, and beliefs. An environment that brings innovative ideas and perspectives, which can ultimately lead to unprecedented success and meaningful social change. In conclusion, my high school experience has taught me that diversity should be appreciated, nurtured, and celebrated. Whether it's the sound of the waves on the beach or the taste of s'mores around a fire pit, experiences beyond our own are essential for stimulating growth, perspective, and understanding.

As I embark on my Ivy League application process, I dream of the opportunity to continue to celebrate diversity while challenging my perspectives, and exploring the rich tapestry of cultures and beliefs. I believe that by attending a school that values diversity, I will unlock new perspectives, find creative solutions, and stretch beyond my comfort zone.

H,313,"On one hot night in a dark room at the heart of Boston, I became friends with 19,580 people in one single moment. We had all journeyed to the TD Garden from wherever we were in our lives to see Tom Petty perform. I knew his music because my mother had shared it with me. It meant something to her and it meant something to me. His music meant something different to every person in that room and all those meanings, all infinite number of them, wrapped around the music notes and existed in harmony on that July night. I had to close my eyes. It was as if I could hear the heartbeats of every person in that room, pulsing along with the rhythm of the music. By sharing his music, Tom Petty gave me a striking awareness of 19,580 people that live and feel alongside each other. Tom Petty will live as long as people feel. Lights flashing beyond my eyelids, I could feel what it was like to live more lives than just my own. Tom Petty's art described his life, but it has weaved its way into those of so many others. My own, my mother's then and when she was my age, and all the strangers around me who didn't seem so strange anymore. We all have to go through our own lives and our own challenges, but just because we have our own lessons to learn doesn't mean we are alone. I looked into the smiles of the crowd, the dancing arms and carefree yes, and realised we were all feeling something of our own. But we were feeling it all together. With the shared heart of others, I can travel vertically through time and horizontally through space. I long to make connections and there are no boundaries that limit how this can be done, not even time and not even space. Imagine trying to count how many people have ever been inspired by the Beatles! Music is an honesty that you embrace more than escape. I sit in front of my piano for hours, copying the rhythm of until it feels right. I'll never tire of hearing another tell me how they're feeling without using any words at all and letting it become part of me. You can't hide from your feelings when someone else is telling them to you. And so I have become a curator of feeling. I am always listening, collecting the art of others. I have stared at paintings until they stared back at me. I cry while I watch almost every film, sometimes just because the characters are nice to each other. I'm as moved by the narrative of my old American Girl Doll books as I am by Dickens. It's all swirls of feelings, of lessons from others that mirror those you need to learn yourself. Art embodies empathy and empathy has become too easy to lose touch with. Art is the same world seen from a different heart. I look at characters or creators and think, How did you become the way you are?' I can look at others and think the same thing. And I have the chance the ask them. Tom Petty did not write 'Breakdown' just for me. Hard Promises comforts more than just me. I cannot live life from just my own perspective. Art exists in everyone. I embrace my hour-long commute to school as a chance to start conversations through the life that flows from my speakers, using old tunes to understand the world through my neighbors as we talk of our favourite colours or the abstract nature of time. My dad doesn't seem so distant when we talk about our mutual love for The Band. This is how our moments are made. This is how we find the music that surrounds all of us, all in each other.",1,2.146559945,2.382802918,2.659808826,2.848327792,2.564716643,9.0,12.0,17.0,23.0,16.0
C0,314,"As I sit in front of my blank computer screen, trying to write something truly unique about the power of music and art, I can't help but wonder if I'm the right person for the job. After all, I'm not a musician or an artist. I don't play an instrument, and my drawings wouldn't even be considered doodles. But as I think more about it, I realize that maybe that's the point. Maybe it's the fact that I'm an outsider to these fields that makes me uniquely qualified to talk about the power of music and art. Growing up, I was always drawn to music and art, despite my lack of skill in these areas. I would spend hours poring over album covers, trying to decipher the hidden meanings and symbols within the artwork. I would listen to my favorite bands on repeat, trying to understand the emotions and experiences that inspired their lyrics. And while I may not have been able to create anything truly noteworthy myself, I was still deeply moved by the power of these forms of expression. It wasn't until I started studying literature in high school that I began to truly appreciate the connection between music, art, and literature. I began to see how these seemingly disparate forms of expression were all part of the same larger conversation about the human experience. Each form was a unique way of exploring and articulating our deepest thoughts, emotions, and desires. But what is it about music and art that makes them so powerful? Why do they have the ability to move us in ways that words alone cannot? I believe that the answer lies in the fact that music and art are both incredibly visceral and abstract at the same time. They tap into something primal within us, something that is beyond language, beyond reason. And yet, at the same time, they have the ability to convey complex ideas and emotions with incredible sophistication and nuance. Take a song like 'Bohemian Rhapsody,' for example. On the surface, it's just a catchy tune with some interesting vocal harmonies. But dig a little deeper, and you'll find a complex meditation on life, death, and the afterlife. The lyrics touch on themes of regret, redemption, and acceptance, all while maintaining a sense of ambiguity and mystery. Or consider the artwork of Salvador Dali. His surrealist paintings are full of bizarre and unsettling images, from melting clocks to ghostly apparitions. And yet, despite their strangeness, there is a sense of order and precision to his work. Every element is carefully chosen and placed to convey a specific mood or message. I believe that it is this combination of visceral and abstract elements that makes music and art so powerful. They have the ability to tap into our deepest emotions and experiences, while simultaneously challenging us intellectually and aesthetically. They engage both our hearts and our minds, giving us a fuller understanding of what it means to be human. But perhaps the most impressive aspect of music and art is the way they can bring people together. Whether it's a concert, a gallery opening, or a street performance, there is something magical about experiencing music and art in a communal setting. It's a shared experience that can bring people from all walks of life together, regardless of their differences. I think back to my own experiences at concerts and art exhibits, and I realize the profound impact these events had on me. There was a sense of connection and understanding that I felt with the people around me, even if I didn't know them personally. We were all brought together by our shared appreciation for the beauty and power of music and art. In conclusion, the power of music and art lies in their ability to tap into something primal and visceral within us, while still engaging us intellectually and aesthetically. These forms of expression have the ability to convey complex ideas and emotions with incredible sophistication and nuance. And perhaps most impressively, music and art have the ability to bring people together, to create a sense of connection and understanding that transcends language and cultural barriers. While I may not be a musician or an artist, I am deeply grateful for the power of music and art in my life. They have allowed me to connect with others in meaningful ways, to explore my own emotions and experiences, and to gain a fuller understanding of what it means to be human.

C2,316,"The notes of the piano danced through the air, each one a little beam of light that illuminated the room. The melody soared and dipped like a bird in flight, evoking emotions in me that I hadn't been prepared for. Music has a transformative power that I've never stopped marveling at. Growing up, I spent hours tinkling on the keys of our family piano, trying to match the songs that played on the radio. But it wasn't until I discovered classical music that I felt the full depth and breadth of what music could be. The sweeping symphonies, the delicate notes, and the raw emotion that flowed through every piece were like a revelation to me. But it wasn't just the music itself that was inspiring. It was the process of creating it. I joined my school's orchestra and felt the thrill of playing with other musicians, each one a unique voice that contributed to a greater whole. Working together to perfect a piece, finding harmony in our differences, and coming out on the other side with something beautiful was a feeling that I never got tired of. This sense of collaboration, teamwork, and community also permeated my other artistic pursuits. I discovered drawing and painting as a way to express emotions that I couldn't put into words. The scratch of the pencil on paper, the slather of paint on canvas, and the pure joy when a piece finally came together were all sensations that I relished. But art and music are not just about the joy they bring us. They are also about the connections that they help us forge. Even when we come from vastly different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, music and art are a shared language that can bridge the gaps between us.

H,317,"My first dream job was to be a pickle truck driver. I saw it in my favorite book, Richard Scarry's 'Cars and Trucks and Things That Go,' and for some reason, I was absolutely obsessed with the idea of driving a giant pickle. Much to the discontent of my younger sister, I insisted that my parents read us that book as many nights as possible so we could find goldbug, a small little golden bug, on every page. I would imagine the wonderful life I would have: being a pig driving a giant pickle truck across the country, chasing and finding goldbug. I then moved on to wanting to be a Lego Master. Then an architect. Then a surgeon. Then I discovered a real goldbug: gold nanoparticles that can reprogram macrophages to assist in killing tumors,produce clear images of them without sacrificing the subject, and heat them to obliteration. Suddenly the destination of my pickle was clear. I quickly became enveloped by the world of nanomedicine; I scoured articles about liposomes, polymeric micelles, dendrimers, targeting ligands, and self-assembling nanoparticles, all conquering cancer in some exotic way. Completely absorbed, I set out to find a mentor to dive even deeper into these topics. After several rejections, I was immensely grateful to receive an invitation to work alongside Dr. Sangeeta Ray at Johns Hopkins. In the lab, Dr. Ray encouraged a great amount of autonomy to design and implement my own procedures. I chose to attack a problem that affects the entire field of nanomedicine: nanoparticles consistently fail to translate from animal studies into clinical trials. Jumping off recent literature, I set out to see if a pre-dose of a common chemotherapeutic could enhance nanoparticle delivery in aggressive prostate cancer, creating three novel constructs based on three different linear polymers, each using fluorescent dye (although no gold, sorry goldbug!). Though using radioactive isotopes like Gallium and Yttrium would have been incredible, as a 17-year-old, I unfortunately wasn't allowed in the same room as these radioactive materials (even though I took a Geiger counter to a pair of shoes and found them to be slightly dangerous). I hadn't expected my hypothesis to work, as the research project would have ideally been led across two full years. Yet while there are still many optimizations and revisions to be done, I was thrilled to find -- with completely new nanoparticles that may one day mean future trials will use particles with the initials 'RK-1' -- thatcyclophosphamide did indeed increase nanoparticle delivery to the tumor in a statistically significant way. A secondary, unexpected research project was living alone in Baltimore, a new city to me, surrounded by people much older than I. Even with moving frequently between hotels, AirBnB's, and students' apartments, I strangely reveled in the freedom I had to enjoy my surroundings and form new friendships with graduate school students from the lab. We explored The Inner Harbor at night, attended a concert together one weekend, and even got to watch the Orioles lose (to nobody's surprise). Ironically, it's through these new friendships I discovered something unexpected: what I truly love is sharing research. Whether in a presentation or in a casual conversation, making others interested in science is perhaps more exciting to me than the research itself. This solidified a new pursuit to angle my love for writing towards illuminating science in ways people can understand, adding value to a society that can certainly benefit from more scientific literacy. It seems fitting that my goals are still transforming: in Scarry's book, there is not just one goldbug, there is one on every page. With each new experience, I'm learning that it isn't the goldbug itself, but rather the act of searching for the goldbugs that will encourage, shape, and refine my ever-evolving passions. Regardless of the goldbug I seek -- I know my pickle truck has just begun its journey.",1,2.688582569,3.150337727,3.51966561,3.938114399,3.388581826,16.2,20.8,24.0,32.0,24.0

C2,320,"The hum of the electron microscope seemed to permeate the entire lab, drowning out any other sound. It was in this lab where I realized my passion for nanomedicine research, where I was introduced to a world of possibility and purpose. I became fascinated with the idea of using nanoparticles to target and destroy cancer cells. It was the potential to rid the world of such a ruthless disease that drew me in. My early morning alarms became a routine as I arrived at the lab every day, excited to immerse myself in the research that was taking place. I still remember the first time I saw a nanoparticle under the microscope. It was like a glittering gem, only infinitesimally small. The texture of its surface, the way the light danced off of it, and the rhythmic popping sounds it made as it moved around ignited my imagination as I pondered about its potential. As I continued my internship, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of new nanoparticles that could change the future of cancer treatment. It was an exhilarating project, one that required creativity, precision, and perseverance. I realized that the world of nanomedicine research was not just about analyzing data and synthesizing nanoparticles. It was also about developing the curiosity to discover and the resilience to keep going, even when faced with setbacks. One day, while conducting an experiment, an error in the lab setting caused particles to adhere to the substrate instead of the targeted cancer cells. But I didn't despair. Instead, I was able to use that mistake as an opportunity to re-imagine the study, and we were able to discover a unique method of distribution. This resilience that I had built up in the lab was further strengthened outside of it. Growing up, I learned to balance extracurricular activities while still maintaining high academic standards. Playing basketball became a way to recharge and take my mind off the stress of schoolwork. I quickly found myself playing with some of the best players in the city and faced competition that pushed me to my limits. I began to learn that the same resilience and drive that I had in the lab translated to other areas of my life. As I matriculated into college, I was eager to pursue degrees in both biology and engineering. I was excited about the possibilities of what I could study and the contributions I could make in the future of nanomedicine research. One defining moment was when I shadowed a surgeon, as they conducted a brain aneurysm surgery. The delicate web of tissue and veins was frightening yet fascinating. In that moment, I saw how interdisciplinary knowledge of not just chemistry, but also biology and engineering, was critical to not only creating nanoparticles that could enter tumor cells but also one that could circumnavigate tight blood vessels without damaging others. As I continue to pursue this passion, I am grateful for the opportunities that I've had so far.

H,321,"On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I sit in soil pulling crab grass and borage. I've been a farmer since sophomore year. The farm--managed by my school--is a one-acre plot more accurately described as a garden with chickens. My task today is to pick cherry tomatoes, most of which have ripened. I grab a tray from the shed and walk across pathways to the vine. I created these pathways during junior year, shoveling large heaps of wood-chips into a wheelbarrow, then raking these chips onto the pathways between beds. Our two tomato vines stand three feet tall and extend horizontally at least six feet; they are heavy with small red and orange glistening spheres. I fall into a rhythm, plucking and setting tomatoes in the container, eating several here and there. I recall when I was six, my Mom would send my twin brother and me to the backyard to weed dandelions. We would get distracted and play with our dog or climb the dogwood tree. I recall the awe I felt last week when I harvested a giant sunflower, discovering at least ten potatoes growing in its roots, or when I found a sweet potato the size of a football. I had planted the seed potato pieces last year. I think about jalapenos, how scratches on their skin indicate spiciness level. The satisfaction I felt the first time I ate a piece of food I grew at the farm, a raw green-bean. The pleasure I feel knowing friends and teachers also eat the food I grow; we donate the farm's produce to our school's dining hall and sell it at the weekly farmer's market in the parking lot. After farm, I will work a shift at the Farmer's Market. I will sit, perhaps eating Thai iced-tea-flavored ice cream from another stand, ready to explain where the farm is located, who works it, what we do with unsold food, and, finally, whether the price for a head of lettuce is negotiable (it is). Sometimes, I remember farmers I met during an exchange trip to Yangshuo, China, who were selling pomelos and bamboo shoots. I think about how to me, the difference between one-versus-two dollars for pomelos seems miniscule, but for those farmers, it means a lot. They rely solely on farming to feed their families; I farm for the pleasure of learning what they do out of necessity. As I carry my share of tomatoes to the shed - tomatoes I nurtured from seeds into sprouts into fruits – I contemplate how much farm has done for me. I can't sit down to a meal without imagining the plants on my plate as seeds and then sprouts, without wondering about the many hands that brought them to my table. Education, to me, means understanding the hidden processes that make up daily life. Playing with the farm chickens - Pablo, Claude, Vincent, Leonardo - and knowing how the coating around an egg works as a natural preservative makes me appreciate my omelet a tad more. Watching weeds that I pulled from various beds slowly decompose into fertilizer in the compost pile makes me consider the roles carbon and nitrogen cycles play in that process. Although I initially joined farm because I wanted to try something new, I quickly found that the work offers a balance with the intellectual work of the rest of my day. The farm connects education with experience; teaching me to see the application of my classroom learning in a real setting. Being able to see the relevance of what I am studying piques my curiosity. I aspire to maintain this connection between education and experience throughout my life, and will always find ways to contribute to my community, locally or globally. I will look for soil to cultivate, using my learning to see and understand more of the world, whether it be the natural environment or the way people live.",1,2.748391938,2.963947615,3.323638274,3.516977688,3.094667962,13.0,18.8,23.4,30.2,21.0
C0,322,"Growing up in the suburbs of Washington D.C., I never thought I would find myself standing knee-deep in mud, surrounded by acres of farmland. However, as I entered high school, my parents decided to seek a slower pace of life and moved our family to a small farm in Virginia. What followed was a transformative experience that taught me invaluable lessons about education and life. From the moment we moved, I knew that I was in for something different. My parents had always been advocates for sustainable living, and they immediately set out to transform our new property into a working farm. For weeks, we worked tirelessly, clearing brush, building fences, and preparing the soil for our first crops. It was backbreaking labor, but something about it felt truly rewarding. With each seed we planted, I felt a sense of purpose and pride that I had never experienced before. Over the months that followed, I discovered that farming has much to teach us about education. As a student, I had always felt that my schooling was disconnected from the real world. I memorized facts and figures, but never truly felt that I was learning anything meaningful. On the farm, however, I quickly realized that every lesson had direct implications for our success. Our yields were directly linked to our knowledge of soil science, meteorology, and pest management. What I had once thought of as abstract concepts suddenly became concrete tools for achieving our goals. When we encountered a problem, we worked together to research possible solutions, experiment with different techniques, and assess the results. In short, we learned by doing, and we learned deeply. One of the most important lessons I learned on the farm was the value of persistence. When we first started gardening, I was surprised to discover how much effort it took to coax a plant from seed to fruit. It seemed like every day brought a new challenge: sudden temperature changes, pests, disease, or drought. It would have been easy to give up when things got tough, but instead, we kept at it. When a crop failed, we analyzed what went wrong, and tried again. Our attitude was that failure was just one more opportunity to learn something new. Over time, I came to realize that this mindset is critical for academic success as well. In school, it can be easy to become discouraged by a single bad grade or overwhelming workload. However, the key to success is to keep pushing forward, even when things seem insurmountable. By adopting a farming mindset, I learned to embrace challenges and turn them into opportunities for growth. Perhaps most importantly, farming has taught me about the interconnectedness of life. Growing food is not just a matter of digging a hole and putting in a seed. It requires a deep understanding of the complex relationships between soil, water, sunlight, and life. The health of one aspect of the system is intricately tied to the health of everything else. Similarly, every problem we encountered was rarely caused by a single factor. Instead, there were often multiple underlying causes that had to be addressed simultaneously. As I look back on my time on the farm, I realize that this lesson has profound implications for all areas of life. We cannot compartmentalize our experiences into neat little boxes, but rather must acknowledge the ways in which everything is interconnected. This lesson has given me both a deep appreciation for the complexity of the world, and a sense of responsibility to work towards positive change. In addition to these larger lessons, farming has also provided me with countless smaller experiences that have shaped who I am. I will never forget the feeling of biting into a tomato fresh off the vine, or the satisfaction of taking home-grown vegetables to the farmer's market. I have learned the joy of working with animals, and the importance of treating them with care and respect. I have come to appreciate the earthworms and insects that help to create healthy soil, and the hardworking bees that pollinate our crops. Looking forward, I know that my experiences on the farm will continue to inform my education and my life. They have given me a sense of purpose and direction that I could never have found in a classroom. More than anything, they have taught me the importance of taking risks, trying new things, and learning by doing. As I move forward in my academic and professional journey, I am excited to see where the lessons of the farm will take me next. Whether it is through studying sustainable agriculture or working to create a more just and equitable world, I am confident that I will carry these experiences with me for the rest of my life.",0,2.470582038,2.699511121,2.900943586,3.101768137,2.847972496,15.0,16.0,18.8,23.0,17.0
C1,323,"As a high school senior, I've come to realize that the experiences I've had in life have played a significant role in shaping the person I am today. However, it's the education I've received that has given me the tools to articulate my experiences and use them for betterment. So, I want to recount my transformative experience with Farm-to-Table education and how it has motivated me to pursue a career in sustainable agriculture. As someone who had primarily experienced education via textbooks, lectures, and screens, I needed more. That's why I signed up for a month-long program at a local farm which offered hands-on experience in sustainable agriculture. I found the focus on “Farm-to-Table” incredibly appealing, which advocates for the direct connection between food producers and consumers. The experience that awaited me, far exceeded my expectations. The program began by introducing me to the basics of farming, from soil preparation, planting, irrigation systems, and organic pest control methods. But it was the sense of community and connectedness that made the experience truly life-altering. For the first time in my life, I worked alongside people of different ages, backgrounds, and experience levels, all with the goal of providing fresh, healthy, and sustainable food for our local community. Through our work, we learned the significance of teamwork, responsibility and commitment. Although we started with the basics, the program quickly took a comprehensive turn, and I began to see the inherent challenges involved in sustainable agriculture. Being a farmer requires patience, resilience, and creativity. There's always uncertainty involved when it comes to weather, pests, and disease. But through it all, I witnessed the determination and passion of the farmers who dedicated their lives to cultivating food. This taught me to appreciate the rewards that come from putting in effort, even when the outcome is uncertain. The most significant impact of the program was the connection between farming and broader concerns of environmental sustainability and social justice. Sustainable agriculture isn't just about growing fresh food but also involves preserving natural resources like water and soil, protecting biodiversity and mitigating climate change. Additionally, sustainable agriculture supports local economies, creates new jobs, and fosters healthy communities. For my final project, I decided to create a student-led farmer's market in our community, where local farmers could sell their products directly to consumers. Though it was a challenging and time-consuming project, it was ultimately rewarding to see how people in our town interacted with the farmers and began to understand the benefits of locally sourced food. It was empowering to see how collaboration and civic engagement can lead to meaningful change. After my experience working with sustainable agriculture, I came to realize that food is not merely sustenance but also a way of connecting with people and the planet. By learning the complex processes involved in food production, I gained a sense of appreciation and respect for farmers who work tirelessly to bring the goodness of the earth to our tables. I now understand that the success of sustainable agriculture can solve many of the world's challenges, from the obesity epidemic to climate change. My transformation from a typical suburban consumer to an aspiring farmer has taught me the importance of real-world learning experiences. Success can't be achieved by merely sitting in a classroom and listening to lectures or reading textbooks. Success requires being out in the world, taking risks, learning from setbacks, and collaborating with others. I aspire to maintain the connection between education and experience throughout my life, and will always actively participate in efforts to better my community, locally or globally. I intend to explore the field of sustainable agriculture further and gain the knowledge and skills needed to become a leading advocate for change. In conclusion, my experience with Farm-to-Table education has inspired me to pursue a career in sustainable agriculture. I will always cherish my experience at the farm and feel grateful for how it has shaped my worldview and opened opportunities for me. Education is vital as it helps us articulate our experiences and use them for the betterment of society. Through sustainable agriculture, I can apply knowledge and make a difference by preserving our earth's resources, promoting biodiversity, and fostering healthy communities.",0,2.874047901,3.09896279,3.401018922,3.574633158,3.309931841,15.0,19.2,22.0,25.0,20.5
C2,324,"I woke up to the sound of roosters crowing in the distance. As I walked outside, the fresh scent of earth and dew filled my nostrils, and the cool breeze brushed against my face. This was my first day at the farm, and I was excited to experience Farm-to-Table education firsthand. The farm was a world away from my suburban hometown. Instead of concrete and glass, I found acres of greenery, with rows of crops, trees, and plants. The chirping of birds overhead, the busy buzzing of bees, and the mooing of cows in the distance created a soundtrack that complemented the lush surroundings. My first task was to shovel compost into the soil for planting. It was hard work and took a lot of effort to make any progress, but I was committed to my goal of learning everything I could about sustainable agriculture. My mentor explained that composting waste matter helps improve soil fertility and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers. As a result, we were not only producing fresh, nutritious vegetables but also helping to maintain natural resources. The daily routine on the farm taught me a lot about perseverance and discipline. Each day started early, and we worked for long hours under the scorching sun. When I wasn't working on the land, I would be in the kitchen, either cooking up a meal or preparing produce for market. I learned to appreciate the hard work and commitment it takes to produce food and understand the value of farm-to-table cuisine. One day, we discovered some crispy lettuce leaves that had been devoured by snails. Although we followed organic pest control methods, it didn't always guarantee full protection from pests. My mentor taught us resilience and patience, reminding us that gardening is a risky business and that setbacks are expected. He had seen it all in his decades spent working the land, but he didn't give up. Instead, he showed us how to cut the leaves and turn it into compost. As I got closer to the end of the program, I felt both nostalgic and inspired. Learning about the interplay between environmental sustainability and social justice was especially influential. One day while working in the fields, we witnessed an oil spill on the nearby river, which threatened the health and livelihoods of the community downstream. This experience illuminated the urgent need to adopt more sustainable agricultural practices and reduce environmental impacts. Before leaving the farm, we launched a student-led farmers' market where we could sell fresh produce to our community members. We noticed how the farmers' market promoted nutritional education, offered fresh food at an affordable price, and supported local economies by creating jobs. It also provided an opportunity for community members to connect with the growers who produced their food. My experience at the farm was a turning point in my life. I widened my perspectives and gained a better appreciation for the environment, food security and organic farming. I realized that sustainable agriculture is not just about producing fresh and healthy food but is also an avenue for promoting environmental sustainability, social justice, and a sense of community. The farm became my second home, and my mentor became my second father. As I applied to Ivy League schools, I reflected deeply on my passion and experience in sustainable agriculture. I have come to understand that learning about nature and community has been an essential part of my growth and development. I've internalized the farm-to-table principle of knowing the source of the food I consume and promoting environmental sustainability. Moreover, I have become an advocate for sustainable agriculture, volunteering with organizations that promote healthy and sustainable communities. I hope to continue advocating for change in the future by studying sustainable agriculture and environmental science in college. I aspire to become a sustainable agriculturalist and carry forward my mentor's teachings to inspire others to join in the efforts of environmental preservation. In conclusion, my experience with Farm-to-Table education has opened my eyes to the tremendous potential that lies in sustainable agriculture. The deep connection between education and real-world experience has taught me a great deal about resilience, discipline, and the importance of collaboration. The program has inspired me to become a vocal advocate for sustainable agriculture and an aspiring leading advocate for the cause. I am excited to embark on this journey and work towards creating a sustainable future for the generations to come.",0,2.783753435,3.043796621,3.205408663,3.381385089,3.140814556,14.0,17.0,19.4,22.0,18.0
H,325,"The heavy front door opened, then shut. He was later today than usual. As I sat there, finishing up my second grade math homework, he greeted me with his trademark whimsical, yet tired, smile. His appearance: a faded, worn-out shirt and durable, dusty jeans; his hands, caked with the grime and dirt that come with his line of work; his hair, on the verge of being assaulted with grey, covered in dust. After washing his hands, his greatest tools for his trade, he sat down with his reheated dinner, prepared by his loving wife forty minutes earlier. Without a word, he began to eat, aching for food after a long day of work. My second grade self couldn't help but notice the juxtaposition in play: a man in old, well-worn clothes, with dusty hair and hands not completely cleaned, dining in a room meticulously and somewhat ornately furnished, the fruit of his labor. We both sat there in silence. I could not help but look at my father the car mechanic in awe, considering where I myself might end up when I am his age. 'Cessi, et sublato montes genitore petivi.' I just have one final line in book two of Vergil's Aeneid, line 804. I gaze at the line for a moment before attacking it. I note how both 'sublato' and 'genitore' are ablative; they go together. I spot 'cessi,' the verb meaning 'I yielded', and 'petivi,' which means 'I sought'. 'Montes' in this scenario is in the accusative case, which means it is the direct object. I translate the line to, 'I yielded, and lifting my father I sought the mountains.' I sat back, pleased with myself for finishing the second book of the renowned epic poem. Just then, my own father opened the door. Over dinner that night, we had another rousing talk regarding my looming college process. This talk was different, however; this was the night when I finally inform my dad of my intention to major in my favorite school topic, the classics. Upon hearing this news, my father's countenance was obscure, untranslatable. When my parents were growing up in Ireland, an apprenticeship was far more valuable than college education. My parents did not attend college because apprentices got jobs sooner than those who went to college. Through apprenticeship my father got his first job. I realize the vast differences between my father's work and what I want to make my life's work. His is a realistic one: a job that was needed back then and is needed even more so today. It is a grueling work, in which one must use their hands and bodies to complete. Mine is perhaps less realistic. The classics once thrived; it was required curriculum at many private schools. The industry has only gone downhill since then, with fewer and fewer students taking the risk to learn the subject. It demands a high level of thinking, with much less physical requirements. Ultimately, I am grateful for my opportunity. My dad worked hard his entire life so that his own children got the chance to attend college to study and become what they want to be, and not what they needed to be for monetary reasons. My father is my hero for working hard, succeeding, and allowing me such a chance. Despite his early doubt, when he soon learned that I did have a plan, which was that I wanted to teach the classics, my dad was at ease. That was all he needed to know. In my father's words, he said that if I had a plan that I was serious about, he would always fully support me. I was overjoyed by the fact that I, much like the pious hero Aeneas, would be able to carry my father, my past, with me toward my unknown future, rather than leave him behind, forever stuck in my past, a memory.",1,2.324589927,2.591633407,2.874176932,3.123194572,2.765063823,8.0,14.0,16.2,24.2,15.5
C0,326,"The sound of my father’s footsteps was a familiar comfort to me as a child. Coming home exhausted from a long day of work, he’d still find the energy to scoop me up and give me a hug. As I grew up, I learned more about the world of work and the sacrifices my dad made to provide for our family. Now, as I begin to explore my own career ambitions, I can’t help but think about the impact my father’s career has had on my own aspirations. Growing up, my dad worked as a mechanic, running his own repair shop in our small town. For my siblings and me, this meant that we were always surrounded by cars and tools, and we knew how to change an oil filter before most kids could even tie their own shoes. But as I grew older, I began to realize that there was more to my dad’s job than just fixing engines. He was a small business owner, dedicating long hours to running the shop, managing finances, and dealing with customers. As I began to consider my own career path, I couldn’t help but find myself drawn to the world of entrepreneurship. I was fascinated by the idea of starting my own business, of taking an idea and turning it into something real. But I was also intimidated by the risks and challenges that come with entrepreneurship. That’s when I turned to my dad for advice. I’ll never forget the conversation we had sitting in his shop one afternoon. He told me about the struggles he faced when he first started his business, about the sleepless nights and the uncertainty. But he also talked about the satisfaction he felt when he saw his hard work pay off, when he was able to provide for his family and make a difference in his community. As I listened to my dad talk about his experience, I realized that he was the perfect mentor for me as I explored my own career ambitions. His journey had been one of grit, resilience, and hard work, and I knew that those were the same traits I would need to succeed as an entrepreneur. Since that conversation, my dad has been my biggest supporter and my most honest critic as I’ve launched my own business, a mobile car detailing service. He’s been there to offer guidance and advice, to share his own experiences, and to remind me of the importance of staying true to my values and my vision. But it’s not just his advice that inspires me. It’s the way he lives his life. My dad has always been a positive force in our family, showing us the importance of kindness, honesty, and hard work through his own example. He’s the first one to lend a helping hand to a neighbor in need, and his integrity is unwavering. He’s a true role model, not just for me, but for everyone who knows him. As I write this essay, I can’t help but think about the journey that lies ahead for me. Entrepreneurship is a path that’s fraught with uncertainty, but I’m reminded of the words my dad told me when I first shared my ambitions with him: “If you really want something, you have to go out there and get it. But you also have to be willing to work hard and never give up.” Those words are etched in my mind, and I know that no matter what twists and turns my own journey may take, I’ll always have my dad’s spirit and guidance to draw upon. Looking back, it’s clear that my dad’s work as a mechanic was about so much more than just fixing cars. It was about creating a life for his family, about making a difference in his community, and about inspiring his children to pursue their own dreams. His example has taught me that work isn’t just a means to an end - it’s a way to create impact, to give back, and to find purpose in life. As I start my own journey as an entrepreneur, I’m reminded of the lessons my dad taught me: to work hard, stay true to my values, and never give up on my dreams. I’m grateful for the sacrifices he made to provide for our family and to set an example of what it means to be a responsible, caring, and honest human being.

C1,327,"The sound of my dad's footsteps marching up our front porch used to be music to my ears when I was a child. I remember running to the door and jumping into his open arms, feeling the warm embrace of someone who genuinely loved me. Regardless of how long he had been working, or how tired he might have looked upon walking in, nothing could break our family's bond. As I grew older, I began to acquire a deeper appreciation for what my father, a mechanic, did for our family. He worked long hours, often caked in oil and grime, to provide for my siblings and me. Growing up around cars and tools, I saw the hard work and dedication required of my dad to run his own repair shop in our small town. Watching him persevere through blistered hands and excruciatingly long days, working tirelessly to grow his business, was inspiring to me. He was much more than a mechanic; he was a problem solver, an entrepreneur, and a provider. The grit and self-discipline he showed was something that left an indelible impression on me. As I began thinking about my future, I found myself gravitating towards entrepreneurship. The process of creating something out of nothing, getting it off the ground and making it grow, always struck me as an appealing challenge. But the task of beginning my journey intimidated me, and I wasn't sure how to proceed. Then came that fateful day when dad and I had our conversation. After many conversations about chasing passions and taking risks in life, I finally found the courage to tell my father that my aspiration was to launch my own business. Unexpectedly, I was met with a silent look of admiration from my dad as he took a deep breath. I felt as though he was reliving his own entrepreneurial journey through me. He spoke candidly of the struggles he experienced in his early days of business, persuading me nevertheless to set forth and chase my dreams. Ever since then, he has been my biggest supporter in my entrepreneurial journey, offering me insights and insider tips, and encouraging me to keep going despite failures. His journey has been my greatest motivation, as watching him overcome adversity and grow his business reminded me that the human spirit is capable of achieving unbelievable things. Watching my father live life with honesty, hard work, and compassion in his interactions leaves no doubt in my mind about what it means to be a real entrepreneur—someone who can influence the lives of those around him and make a real difference. He’s a true inspiration, not just for me, but the rest of the world. Dad is a father, mentor, role model, and a friend who is always ready with an encouraging word or a friendly smile. He taught me to be kind to everyone I meet and what it means to be a real, decent human being. His pledge to raising our family with the right moral compass established the foundation upon which we build our lives. As I embark on my journey in entrepreneurship, I can’t help but think of my dad's advice: 'If you genuinely want something, go out there and get it. But you also need to be willing to work hard and never give up.' These words have stuck with me, and they're my guiding light, as I continue to venture into new territory and reach for the stars. My dad is proof that work isn't merely a means to an end. It's much more than that. It's about making a difference, creating a life you can be pleased with, and fulfilling your aspirations. I'll always be grateful for the sacrifices he has made to give my siblings and me the opportunities he never had. As I move forward in my career, I know my dad's footprints will remain with me, guiding and supporting me. His example has taught me never to give up on my dreams, to work hard with dedication, and to always believe in myself. I couldn't ask for a better gift. Looking back, I see that being born to my father is one of the greatest blessings life has bestowed upon me. He's been the guiding light in my life, and I'll always strive to make him proud.

The creaking of the porch's wooden panels and the soft rustling of the wind chimes as he walked towards the door added an extra layer of comfort to my soul. I'd sprint towards the door, yearning to leap into his open arms and treasure that warm embrace. It wasn't merely a hug, it was a reunion of love and unbridled joy. As I grew older, I learned to appreciate my father's profession as a mechanic, realizing the amount of care and devotion he put into it.

H,329,"My math teacher turns around to write an equation on the board and a sun pokes out from the collar of her shirt. A Starbucks barista hands me my drink with a hand adorned by a small music note. Where I work, a customer hands me her credit card wearing a permanent flower bracelet. Every day, I am on a scavenger hunt to find women with this kind of permanent art. I'm intrigued by the quotes, dates, symbols, and abstract shapes I see on people that I interact with daily. I've started to ask them questions, an informal interview, as an excuse to talk with these diverse women whose individuality continually inspires me. You can't usually ask the sorts of questions I have been asking and have the sorts of conversations I have been having, so I've created this project to make these kinds of encounters a bit more possible and acceptable. There is no school assignment, no teacher to give me a grade, and no deadline. I don't have a concrete outcome in mind besides talking with a mix of interesting women with interesting tattoos. So far I've conducted fifteen interviews with a range of women from my hometown to Hawaii, teenagers to senior citizens, teachers to spiritual healers. The same set of questions has prompted interviews lasting less than twenty minutes and over two hours. I'm being told stories about deaths of a parent, struggles with cancer, coming out experiences, sexual assaults, and mental illnesses. All of these things that may be taboo in today's society, these women are quite literally wearing on their sleeves. I'm eager to continue these interviews in college and use all of the material I've gathered to show the world the strength and creativity of these wonderful women I've encountered. I want to explore the art and stories behind the permanent transformations of personal landscapes. I attempt this by asking questions about why they decided to get their tattoos, how they were received in the workplace, the reactions from family and friends, and the tattoo's impact on their own femininity. Through these simple questions, I happened upon much greater lessons regarding human interaction, diversity, and connectedness. In my first interview, a local businesswoman told me about her rocky relationship with her mother, her struggles with mental illness, and her friend in jail, within 45 minutes of meeting her and in the middle of a busy Starbucks. An artist educator I worked with told me that getting a tattoo was like claiming a part of yourself and making it more visible and unavoidable.' A model/homeopath said that having a tattoo is like 'giving people a little clue about you.' A psychologist shared how she wishes that she could turn her tattoos 'on or off like a light switch to match different outfits and occasions.' I've realized that tattoos show the complex relationship between the personal and the public (and how funny that can be when a Matisse cutout is thought to be phallic, or how a social worker's abstract doodle is interpreted as a tsunami of sticks, alien spaceship, and a billion other things by the children she works with). I've learned so much about the art of storytelling and storytelling through art. I've strengthened relationships with people that had conventional roles in my life and created friendships with some unconventional characters. Most importantly, I've realized that with the willingness to explore a topic and the willingness to accept not knowing where it will go, an idea can become a substantive reality.",1,2.771616368,2.847040587,3.090291612,3.224189777,2.992641034,16.0,19.0,23.0,30.0,20.0
C0,330,"Tattoos have increasingly become a way for people to express themselves and tell their stories. I have always been drawn to the idea of tattoos and the potential to display powerful and significant messages onto my own skin. As a child, tattoos seemed taboo, something only bikers and prisoners wore. But as I grew older, I realized tattoos could be so much more - a representation of who you are and what you stand for. My first tattoo was a small, black and white semicolon on the inside of my left wrist. It is a tribute to my grandfather, who took his own life when I was just six years old. The semicolon represents my grandfather's story not ending with his suicide, but instead continuing on - a metaphor for life continuing despite its ups and downs. The semicolon project, which raises awareness for suicide prevention, has always resonated with me. It has provided me with a sense of hope that even in the darkest of times, one can continue writing their story. My second tattoo is a peony flower with the stem twisting into a semicolon on the inside of my right wrist. The peony represents my grandmother, an immigrant who overcame many obstacles to make a life for herself in America. She was a strong and resilient woman who instilled in me the belief that anything is possible with hard work and determination. The peony is a symbol of her strength and beauty, while the twisting stem represents the continuation of her story through my own. My third tattoo depicts a tree with exposed roots on my upper back. This tattoo represents the importance of family and ancestry. The roots represent the foundation and beginning of my family story, while the tree itself represents growth and continuation. The branches are bare, allowing for new leaves to grow and the story to continue. Additionally, roots remain hidden, yet strong and foundational - representing the bonds of family that remain even when not visible. These tattoos are not just ink on my skin, but physical representations of the people who have influenced and shaped my life. They remind me of the stories and experiences that have led me to where I am today. However, tattoos are not always met with open arms. There are still negative stereotypes associated with tattoos and those who have them. People often make assumptions about an individual based on their tattoos, assuming they are rough or unprofessional. I have experienced this negativity firsthand when employers have questioned or been put off by my tattoos during job interviews. But just because someone has tattoos does not mean they are any less capable, intelligent, or professional. A tattooed person can be just as qualified for a job as others without ink on their skin. Despite the negative stereotypes, tattoos have become more accepted in society. The personal meaning and significance behind tattoos have shifted the focus from judgments and assumptions towards understanding and respect. Tattoos have become a way for individuals to express their creativity and personal narratives, a way to tell their stories without words. I believe that tattoos have the power to bring people together. Just like any form of creative expression, tattoos can spark conversations and connections between people who may not have interacted otherwise. I have had numerous conversations with strangers who have approached me because of my tattoos. They often ask about the stories behind each tattoo, leading to discussions about life, death, love, and everything in between. Tattoos have created an avenue for communication that transcends societal boundaries and unites people through shared experiences. In conclusion, my tattoos have become a significant part of my personal narrative and identity. They have empowered me to embrace my own story and express myself in a way that is both meaningful and creative. Each tattoo represents a different aspect of my life, from my family history to my own personal struggles and hopes for the future. Tattoos have become more than just body art, but a medium for storytelling, an avenue for connection, and a symbol of personal strength and resilience.",0,2.656877516,2.730660099,2.923247768,3.092844534,2.871889721,14.4,17.0,20.0,22.0,19.0
C1,331,"Tattoos have become more than just a societal taboo today. They are now an integral part of the way people communicate and explore their emotions. Personally, tattoos have become a way for me to express myself and connect with others, despite societal stereotypes. As I have grown older, my interest in tattoos has expanded beyond simple designs or pictures. I am fascinated by the underlying messages and stories that people choose to display on their skin. The permanent nature of tattoos makes them stand out and be a reflection of one's personal journey, making it a powerful and meaningful way to communicate and connect with others. The process of getting a tattoo often involves personal introspection and meditation, as one contemplates the message they wish to convey. I find that this process of introspection is an essential part of healing and personal growth. In many ways, tattoos have become a form of therapy, a way to acknowledge personal struggles and battles and overcome them symbolically. The idea of tattoos being taboo is gradually decreasing as more people get inked. However, there is still a stigma attached to visible tattoos in professional work environments. Employers often assume that tattoos are unprofessional, assuming that the ink reflects unprofessionalism or rebellious attitudes. I fundamentally disagree with this notion. Tattoos do not diminish one's capacity to excel in their work, nor do they detract from one's professionalism. My tattoos, in fact, have been instrumental in sparking conversations and connections with others. They serve as a means to start a conversation and connect with people who may have not interacted with me otherwise. My inked skin often prompts people to ask questions, share their own tattoo stories, and connect over shared experiences. Through these experiences, I have learned that tattoos can transcend societal boundaries and serve as a bridge between human experiences. Tattooing is now gaining recognition as a form of art in its right. I have seen tattoos that resemble intricate paintings and designs that capture profound stories and deeper meanings. Tattoos have a potential to reflect artistic and creative talent, not just symbols of rebellion. As an aspiring artist, I see tattoos as an outlet for creativity and self-expression. I appreciate that they represent a permanent connection to an individual's personal story, making them an extension of one's journey through life. They allow one to both display and celebrate their personal growth and transitions. In conclusion, tattoos have gone beyond mere decoration and have now become fundamental to one's self-expression, communication, and identity. They represent personal journeys and can serve as an opportunity for personal healing and growth. As a society, we should show empathy and understanding towards those with tattoos, viewing their body art as an extension of their unique story rather than society’s stereotypes. The evolving tattoo culture serves as a metaphor for our growing desire to know more about each other's stories and experiences. Let us celebrate and appreciate the art of tattooing, along with each other's unique and captivating stories.",0,2.653073536,2.785156584,2.893623963,2.997910483,2.865731716,14.0,16.0,17.8,21.0,17.0
C2,332,"As I sat in the tattoo parlor, the buzz of the needle a constant buzz in my ear, I felt the pressure pulsed into my skin as the ink was permanently imprinted on it. I had a sense of calmness and peace that carried me away. The tattoo would always serve as a reminder of the progress and healing that had taken place in my life. I remember the first time I saw a tattoo that caught my attention. It was on an older man sitting in a coffee shop that I frequented. It was a bold image of an eagle, its strong wings spread wide. The tattoo was not only an image but also a symbol. It represented the freedom the man had found in his life after overcoming addiction. He had not only escaped his addiction but also accomplished things that once seemed impossible, such as making amends with his estranged family. I felt astounded by how tattoos could be powerful symbols of personal growth and recovery. Tattoos, in essence, are an expression of the soul. They communicate emotions, beliefs, values, and experiences uniquely. Furthermore, tattoos serve as an immediate conversation starter, allowing for a glimpse into one's life story. These colorful designs speak louder than words ever could, providing a window into one's unique and captivating story. What I love most about tattoos is their ability to transcend societal norms and bring people together from different backgrounds. They allow individuals to express themselves and connect with those who may not have had the opportunity otherwise. Once, while taking a walk through the city, I noticed a woman sporting a small tattoo of a lotus flower on her wrist. I began talking to her, expecting the conversation to be brief. However, I soon found out that she had recently overcome cancer, and the lotus flower reflected her personal journey of healing and resilience. We talked for a while, even though we were strangers, and shared our stories. Tattoos have taught me that shared experiences bring people together in unexpected ways. Tattooing has become a unique and respected art form throughout the years, allowing artists to display their expression and creativity beyond the traditional mediums like canvas and paper. The intricate designs and complexity of tattoos demand great skill and attention to detail to create. It is through this process of delicate needlework that the artist and the customer bond over a common goal. The finished tattoo is the culmination of the collaboration between the artist and the individual, an extension of their collective vision. As more people embrace tattoos, we will see additional changes in how they are perceived. I believe that tattoos are no longer a sign of rebelliousness but instead growing into a reflection of our society's evolving culture. At a time when open expression and communication are actively being celebrated, tattoos have become an integral part of that dialogue. They are symbols of our individual journeys, our trials, and our triumphs. In conclusion, tattoos have a symbolic significance far beyond their outward appearance. They represent personal growth and self-expression, overcoming struggles and odd scenarios, and a window into one's individual journey. Tattooing is more than just skin deep, and what we see on the outside is only the tip of the iceberg. Tattoos transcend boundaries, forging connections between people that might never have happened otherwise. They represent personal and artistic expression, a statement of self, and a sign of empathy between people. Tattoos are, in essence, a permanent representation of who we are, what we have lived through, and where we are going.",0,2.435917574,2.637303125,2.849170968,3.008764308,2.789848459,12.8,14.6,18.0,21.0,16.0
H,333,"“You’re such a hipster.” It’s a phrase heard everyday in school hallways across America, and its usage often operates as a conundrum that obscures teenagers’ perceptions of themselves and who they want to be. I, in turn, have struggled immensely with the paradoxical use of this label. Since the onset of my tween years and perhaps even before that, I have constantly carried with me an insistent urge for nonconformity; it has never sat well with me to be like everyone else. Throughout my middle school years, this natural instinct of mine manifested itself in many different ways: jeans tucked into knee-high socks, anything from punk to Harlem renaissance jazz bellowing from my headphones, Palahniuk novels peeking out of my backpack. As my identity shifted, my career as a social renegade flourished, and I found in myself a certain pride in being different and a passion for seeking out eccentric new ways to express myself. With the realization of my newfound passion, my nonconformist qualities were locked in, and I began high school without the usual freshman trepidation about getting labeled or branded. Thereby, I continued my habitual antics, rebelling against the social norm and doing what I could to think freely. In doing so, however, I encountered a particular subculture defined by certain fashion trends and, to some extent, genres of music. This subculture was and still is often associated with the term “hipster” and regarded as having a correspondence with the “hipster lifestyle.” Moreover, so-called “hipsters” are known to have particularly poignant tendencies towards nonconformity. Thus, my rise to the hipster ideal began. I was enamored with various aspects of this subculture, so I enthusiastically donned a beanie and cardigan and crammed every Bon Iver and The Smiths album I could find on to my iPod. Such new developments in my identity perfectly suited my singularity as a nonconformist; no one I knew had adopted this flair. Admittedly, my new garb was somewhat funky, and thus the new look evoked, in both positive and negative renditions, choruses of “You’re such a hipster!” The attention was extraordinarily gratifying, and I consequently plunged into obsession with my new label, consumed in an effort to sustain my “hipster” reputation. Much of my mental vitality was spent on keeping my appearance and status up to a sufficiently “hipster” standard. The questions I asked myself about who I wanted to be quickly evolved into “How can I fit the ideal?” and “How can I conform?” Herein lies the continual paradox for people who identify themselves as “hipsters” and the contradiction that brought me much confusion and uncertainty for parts of my high school career: implicit in the definition of the term “hipster” is the prominence of nonconformity in all aspects of a “hipster’s” lifestyle. Individualist ideals permeate his clothes, his music, his social behavior, even his politics. Simultaneously, however, one who seeks to identify himself and be identified by others as a “hipster” undoubtably strives to conform to the “hipster” construct; he tries to fit himself inside an inflexible “hipster” box. Nevertheless, as with most paradoxes, the problem at hand does not imply a real contradiction. I found the solution after many months of personal struggle with my own identity. It is not that there is something inherently wrong with the qualities of a “hipster.” I have come to understand that a label such as “hipster” must never precede my own actual characteristics, and I can never let such a notion inform my identity by itself. Before I ever begin to set words to my character, I have to figure out who I am free from outside influence. The adjectives come much later.",1,2.521560083,2.975515011,3.553025974,3.724498849,3.108641393,14.2,21.0,33.6,34.8,25.0
C0,334,"I remember the first time I heard the term “hipster,” it was in the context of someone describing a group of people who were obsessed with fashion, music, and art that was not mainstream. They were the cool kids who shopped at thrift stores, rode fixie bikes, and listened to bands with names that no one could pronounce. When I entered high school, I met many people who identified as hipsters, and I began to wonder if being a hipster was just a trend, or if it was something more meaningful. As I delved deeper, I realized that being a hipster was a paradox. On one hand, it was about being individualistic and rebelling against mainstream culture, but on the other hand, it was also about creating a new, exclusive culture with its own set of fashion, music, and lifestyle rules. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that this paradox extended beyond hipsterism and into many facets of modern-day society. One of the ways that being a hipster is paradoxical is through the concept of authenticity. Hipsters value authenticity and individuality, but they also actively seek out trends and styles that have been deemed cool by their subculture. They are looking for something that is unique and genuine, but everyone else in their clique is looking for the same thing. In this pursuit of individualism, everyone ends up looking the same. Another paradox is the idea of counterculture versus mainstream culture. Hipsters pride themselves on being countercultural and resisting the commercialization of everything, but at the same time, many of the things they wear and listen to have become part of mainstream culture. They take pride in being the first to discover new bands, but once those bands become popular, they quickly move on to something else in order to maintain their sense of individuality and exclusivity. The hipster paradox can even be seen in their supposed rejection of materialism. They reject mainstream brands and consumer culture, yet they often spend large amounts of money on items that represent their subculture. Everything from customized bicycles, rare vinyl records, and vintage clothing can command prices far beyond their actual worth. These same objects and the lifestyle that surrounds them feel to many like frivolities and a regression back to materialism over substance. Despite these paradoxes, the appeal of hipsters and their movement continues to persist. Perhaps this is because being a hipster is not just about the clothes you wear, the music you listen to, or the stuff you own. At its core, being a hipster is about rejecting the status quo and seeking out something different. As a teenager, it can often feel like the world is forcing you into a mold that you don't fit into. Being a hipster is a way to rebel against that and create a space for yourself where you feel like you belong. On a deeper level, the hipster paradox reflects a larger societal issue. It highlights the tension that often exists between individuality and group belonging. It's natural to want to be part of a tribe or a community, to share experiences and values with others. But at the same time, our culture places a high value on individualism, and the pressure to stand out and be unique can be overwhelming. The paradox of being a hipster shows us that it's possible to embrace both individuality and community, but it requires a delicate balance. As I prepare to apply for college, I often think about the paradox of being a hipster and how it relates to my own life. There is a pressure to conform to the expectations of the world around me; to achieve high grades and participate in extracurricular activities that will look good on my application. At the same time, I want to maintain my sense of individuality and pursue interests that are meaningful to me. I've come to realize that the key to balancing individuality and community is authenticity. It's about being true to yourself and your values, even if that means going against the grain. It's about seeking out experiences and ideas that are meaningful to you, regardless of whether they are popular or trendy. It's about embracing the paradoxes of life and allowing yourself to exist in the in-between spaces. The paradox of being a hipster is not just a trend or a passing fad. It's a reflection of the tension that exists within our society and within ourselves. It's a reminder that being unique and being part of a community are not mutually exclusive. And it's a call to seek out authenticity and embrace the paradoxes that make us who we are.",0,2.532015798,2.667563184,2.824178652,3.228910177,2.725646385,14.0,17.8,22.0,25.0,20.0
C1,335,"In high school, I was determined to be different from everyone else. I sought out nonconformity in every aspect of my life; from my fashion choices to my taste in music, I aimed to be unique. But as I discovered the world of hipster culture, I realized that this desire for individuality is a paradox. Hipster culture celebrates nonconformity, but also has its own set of rules and trends that everyone follows in order to be part of the 'in' crowd. As I pondered this paradox, I came to realize that this struggle for identity extends beyond just hipster culture. Our society values individuality, but also emphasizes the importance of community and belonging. The pressure to conform and be like everyone else often pulls against the need to stand out and be different. As I prepare to apply to college, I'm confronted with this tension once again. How do I balance the need to be an individual with the desire to be part of a community? The answer, I believe, lies in authenticity. It's about being true to yourself and your values, even if that means going against the norm. It's about seeking out experiences and ideas that are meaningful to you, regardless of whether they are popular or not. It is a matter of embracing the paradoxes that make up our identity rather than conforming to rigid labels and stereotypes. The paradox of being a hipster highlights the tension that exists between individuality and community. On one hand, hipsters pursue individuality through fashion trends and music genres that are not mainstream. But on the other hand, they form a community of like-minded people who share these interests, and as a result, they end up looking the same. Through this, the paradox lies not in the movement itself but in how it is pursued. It highlights the tension of our society between the pressure to conform and the need to be different. In this paradox, we see that the issue isn't conformity itself. It's about the pressure to conform to a particular definition of ourselves that isn't genuine. We are easily caught up in the desire to fit a stereotype, and we lose sight of who we truly are. We need to recognize that our identity comes from within and not from external labels. If we begin to understand who we are, we can then find ways to connect with people who share our individuality rather than just our labels. Through my journey of self-discovery, I have come to realize that authenticity is crucial for balancing individuality and community. It is vital to embrace the paradox of being a hipster and to recognize the tension that exists around us. It is important to own your identity regardless of external influences and to know that self-understanding precedes any label or tag that people could ever come up with. As I apply for college, I know that I will be judged on the basis of my test scores, extracurricular activities, and more. However, instead of trying to fit into a mold or label, I will strive to be true to myself. I will seek out experiences that excite me and will look for people who share my passion. Furthermore, I will embrace the paradox of individuality and community and find a way to balance them. By doing so, I am confident that I will be able to find success in college and beyond. In conclusion, the paradox of being a hipster is a symptom of a larger issue of balancing individuality and community. It highlights the tension that exists within our society, and it calls for us to be authentic in our identity. Understanding who we are outside of external labels and stereotypes, will allow us to move beyond the paradox and pursue a life of fulfillment and meaningful relationships in which we embrace who we are, and we connect with people who share our passions.",0,2.487019698,2.64587553,2.866508564,2.940493749,2.736640934,15.0,18.0,19.8,21.8,19.0
C2,336,"I still remember the first time I entered a hipster coffee shop. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee overwhelmed my senses, and the chatter of people echoed through the room, accompanied by the ambient indie rock music playing. Everywhere I looked, I saw people with unique hairstyles, vintage clothing, and thick-framed glasses. At first, I felt out of place. But as I began to appreciate the aesthetic and the people around me, I realized that there was more to being a hipster than just a set of fashion choices. Despite their apparent uniqueness, I found that hipsters all shared a common passion for seeking out experiences that were authentic and meaningful. Whether it was through music, art, or food, they aimed to express their individuality by taking part in experiences that were outside the norm. This pursuit of authenticity is what makes hipster culture so fascinating and has led me to explore the paradox at the heart of it- the balance between individuality and community. Hipster culture celebrates breaking from societal norms, but it also has its own trends and beliefs that the community follows. Despite this, I have seen people in the hipster community embrace their paradoxical identity by finding ways to balance their individuality with their desire for connection. By doing so, they have created a vibrant and diverse community that values authenticity above everything else. Through my experiences exploring this paradox, I've come to realize that authenticity is the key to balancing individuality and community. Instead of being defined by external labels and stereotypes, it is essential to embrace who we are at our core. By doing so, we create the space for meaningful connections with others who share our passions while still celebrating our unique identities. Growing up, I struggled with anxiety and depression. My way of coping was to embrace my uniqueness, which I felt gave me a sense of control in my life. I started to explore fashion, music, and art that spoke to me and helped me express my emotions. As time went on, I gained more confidence in my identity and began to share my interests with others. One summer, I joined a team at a summer camp. I was excited to meet new people, but I couldn't help feeling anxious about fitting in. However, as I got to know the other team members, I realized that they appreciated my unique perspective and encouraged me to share my thoughts and ideas. It was one of the most profound examples of what happens when we embrace authenticity. When we are authentic, we create the space for others to be authentic as well. It allows us to connect with people who share our passions without compromising our identity. Through my own experiences, I have found that authenticity leads not only to individual fulfilment but also to meaningful connections with others. In conclusion, the paradox of balancing individuality and community is a fundamental aspect of human experience. Hipster culture highlights this tension, but it is by no means exclusive to this group. We all struggle to find the balance between being individuals and being part of a community. However, through embracing authenticity, we can find fulfilment and connection with others who share our passions without compromising who we are. As I prepare to apply to college, I am reminded that it is essential to go beyond external labels and seek out experiences that speak to me.

H,337,"Describe something you have inherited that you find flawed. The town files in for the 8th annual race between the tortoise, Joe T. Plumber Plumber, and the hare, Mr. GoldsteinKrupp. Men, women, and children of the city of Fabric take their seats, eating large popcorns and drinking sodas. Everyone’s eyes fixed on the track waiting to see if this year the tortoise will have a chance. There are regulators at every mile to ensure the hare plays by the rules established by the Security Enforcement Commission. The fans have no influence on the race. Whoever crosses the finish line first is awarded one million coins plus a bonus correlating to the time the winner finishes under his opponent. Guiding the path is yellow caution tape to guide the competitors- “it serves as merely a guide” says the tape-makers. Gun shot. The contestants start the race. Naturally, the hare jumps ahead of the tortoise keeping a calm pace as he saunters down the track. But a leisurely victory and a mere million coins are insufficient for GoldsteinKrupp. In between the first and second mile, where no regulators can see, the hare cuts under the tape and enters an underground tunnel to emerge near the beginning of the fifth mile. The hare casually uses similar subterfuges throughout the race knowing that the understaffed regulators will not catch him. While the hare is heading through a maze of intricate tunnels located under the bleachers, the tortoise is approaching the 3rd mile, heading down the track as indicated. He stops briefly every mile to inquire about each regulator’s wife, kids, and personal life. The hare finds himself cutting across to the 11th mile when he hears a rusty cringe coming from above ground, but the hare chooses to ignore it, keeping his eyes on the prize. Then, there is an even louder, slow, creaking noise and then a crash. The hare is knocked in the head, falls to the ground, and feels a sharp pain in his arm. The bleachers above the hare have collapsed, and many spectators are injured. With tormenting pain, the hare moves some dirt and crawls his way out to the eleventh mile. The hare grips his arm and walks slowly to the finish line to accept his rightly deserved prize. The crowd, some of them on the ground, is staring at the hare angrily, but unsure of what they have just experienced. My generation and I are about to inherit this race- an unstable, corrupt financial and political system. Regulators are unaware and understaffed while rating agencies are misguiding and conflicted. Banks have put money as their top priority, the ends have justified the means, and when the ends became a financial collapse, Americans were hurt and confused. Our task as heirs is to return the business world to a state where an ethic code is paramount and civilians are never the victims of their own creation.

C0,338,"The 2008 financial crisis was a wake-up call for many Americans, including my family. We were not immune to its impact, and the events that unfolded forced me to grapple with the concept of inheriting a flawed financial system. I grew up in a middle-class family, where money was never a topic of discussion. My parents shielded me from their financial struggles, and I was oblivious to the realities of living paycheck to paycheck. It was only after the crisis that my family's vulnerability was laid bare. My father, a small-business owner, was hit hard, as clients who had promised steady business went bankrupt or simply could no longer afford his services. My mother, who had worked at a local bank for over a decade, suddenly found herself without a job when the bank was acquired and staff was reduced. I watched as my parents struggled to make ends meet, taking on odd jobs and cutting back on expenses. We canceled family vacations and postponed home repairs. I could see the worry etched on their faces every time bills arrived, and it pained me to see them struggle. I too felt the impact of the crisis. My college savings, which had been invested in the stock market, took a significant hit. I remember logging onto my account and seeing the value of my savings reduced by half. I felt a sense of helplessness, as if the future I had imagined for myself was slipping away. But the crisis also sparked in me a curiosity and a desire to understand how the financial system worked. I began to read articles and watch documentaries, trying to piece together how the crisis happened and why it affected so many people. What I discovered was unsettling. The financial system, designed to allocate capital efficiently and promote economic growth, had become a behemoth that was disconnected from the real needs of families and businesses. The frenzy of mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, and other complex financial instruments had created an illusion of wealth that was built on shaky foundations. But what shocked me even more was the lack of accountability. The people responsible for the crisis, whether they were CEOs of banks or regulators, were largely untouched by the consequences. They received bonuses and golden parachutes while millions of Americans lost their homes and life savings. This realization left me with a sense of outrage, but also with a drive to make a difference. I didn't want to be a passive observer of a financial system that had let down so many. I wanted to become part of the solution. In the years that followed, I became involved in various organizations that aimed to promote financial literacy and social responsibility. I tutored low-income students on the basics of personal finance, helping them understand the value of saving and the dangers of debt. I volunteered at a credit union, where I witnessed firsthand how a community-based financial institution could make a difference in the lives of its members. I also delved deeper into the study of economics, taking courses that examined the role of financial institutions and the factors that contribute to economic inequality. I learned about alternative economic models that prioritize sustainability, social justice, and community empowerment. Through these experiences, I came to understand that the financial system is not a monolithic entity. It is made up of individuals and institutions that make choices about how to allocate resources and distribute risk. It is shaped by laws and policies that reflect values and priorities. And this is where the hope lies. If the financial system is flawed, it is because we have allowed it to be so. But we also have the power to reshape it. We can demand greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity. We can support financial institutions that prioritize the needs of their members and communities. We can advocate for policies that promote sustainable growth, reduce economic inequality, and protect vulnerable populations. As I stand on the cusp of my college journey, I am more convinced than ever that my passion lies in the intersection of finance, economics, and social justice. I want to continue to explore how we can create a financial system that works for all people, not just the elite few. I want to engage in critical conversations about the role of money and power in shaping society. I want to challenge the assumptions and norms that have allowed a flawed financial system to persist. Inheriting a flawed financial system is not a burden, but an opportunity. It is a call to action, a reminder that we have the power to shape our economic future. As I embark on the next chapter of my life, I do so with a sense of purpose and a commitment to making a difference. I am ready to contribute my skills, my passion, and my knowledge to creating a better, more just world.",0,2.503443784,2.775608239,2.934033048,3.232341123,2.840252722,12.2,16.0,19.0,23.0,18.0
C1,339,"As a high school senior preparing to take part in the notoriously grueling college application process, I have come to understand that the education system is flawed. Despite the abundance of opportunities presented to me, I recognize that not everyone has the educational access and resources necessary to be able to compete on an equal footing with their peers. I inherited this flawed education system, but I am determined to challenge it. Throughout my academic journey, there have been many instances where access to quality education has been a privilege rather than a right. I’ve watched in despair as students in underfunded schools struggle to keep up with their peers. I’ve seen teachers who care deeply about the students they teach but lack essential resources to provide an enjoyable and enriching learning experience. These are systemic flaws of our educational system. The causes of these flaws are numerous- disparities in funding leading to educational inequality, standardized testing that prioritizes exams over actual learning, and a lack of representation and diversity in curriculum, among other issues. Yet, despite these well-documented problems, change has been slow to come. The flaws in our education system came into sharp focus during the COVID-19 pandemic. With the sudden shift to remote learning, it became clear that not all students had access to the same educational resources outside of school. Technological barriers, device shortages, and inaccessibility plagued many students, undermining their ability to succeed in a digital-only learning environment. Remote learning also revealed how difficult it can be to maintain a sense of community and connectivity among learners and educators, which is crucial for effective education. As someone who has always been passionate about learning and education, I am deeply troubled by these systemic problems. I believe that all students deserve access to high-quality education, regardless of race, socioeconomic status, or geographical location. Students should not have to struggle to secure adequate resources to get by in their academic journey. As such, it is my goal to become involved in education reform efforts at the university level. I aim to challenge the status quo by advocating for policies that will address the educational disparities students face. I intend to work alongside others who share my passion for educational equity to tackle the systemic issues that hinder modern-day education. To do this, it is important to foster a sense of community and work towards a common goal. This can be achieved through mentorship and peer support. I want to help create a community where students can get the support they need to work through their academic challenges together while allowing them the flexibility to achieve their individual goals. Beyond the importance of personal connections, it is also crucial to advocate for fundamental policy changes that will make a real impact in classrooms across the country. One solution is to provide students with more opportunities to engage in project-based learning, which can serve as an excellent means to develop crucial critical thinking and creative problem-solving skills. A more inclusive curriculum that portrays a wide range of historical figures from different cultures can also help create a more equitable learning environment. Lastly, it’s important to increase accessibility to resources. Identifying areas where students are underserved, and increasing funding to bolster those areas can help push towards equity in education. Furthermore, increasing the number of scholarships and grants that go towards education could reduce the burden many students feel when it comes to costs. I recognize that the change I hope to effect will not happen overnight, but I am committed to continuing the work. Through activism and engagement, I am working towards a future where access to quality education is taken for granted and where all students have the opportunity to thrive academically. In conclusion, I realize that I have inherited a flawed education system; however, it is my responsibility to challenge and transform it. By equipping students with the tools they need, widening the scope of the curriculum, and advocating for adequate resources, we can achieve a more equitable system of education. My hope is to work alongside others who share this goal, working tirelessly towards an education system that serves everyone equally.",0,2.775194984,3.048792082,3.297116431,3.432740342,3.117725784,16.4,19.0,22.2,27.0,21.0
C2,340,"The sound of rain tapping against the windowpane, the scent of freshly brewed coffee, and the softness of my favorite blanket enveloped me as I sat down to contemplate my future. The walls of my room were decorated with posters and photographs, each symbolizing different facets of my personality and experiences. Looking at them, I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed by the weight of the decision I had to make - where do I want to go to college? As a high school senior, I am faced with one of the most consequential choices of my life - choosing the college that will shape and mold me into the person I will become. The choice to aim for Ivy League schools like Yale or Harvard is not an easy one, given their prestige and exclusivity. However, I believe that I can rise to the challenge with hard work, determination, and a strong essay. I have always been a curious person with an insatiable appetite for knowledge. My hunger for learning is the result of the environment I grew up in. My parents, both immigrants from different parts of the world, instilled in me the belief that education was my key to success. As a result, I have always taken my studies seriously, challenging myself academically, and participating in extracurricular activities like debate, Model UN, and volunteering. One of my defining moments came when I participated in a Model UN competition. It was an eye-opening experience that exposed me to different perspectives and values. I represented a country that had a different worldview from my own, which meant that I had to put myself in their shoes and understand their motivations. It was a moment of empathy that changed the way I saw the world, and it is an experience that I carry with me to this day. Another experience that has shaped me is my involvement in volunteer activities. Through volunteering, I have been able to connect with different communities and contribute to causes that I care about. One of the most rewarding experiences was when I volunteered at a food shelter. Serving food to the homeless made me realize how privileged I am and how easy it is to take things for granted. It was humbling to see how small acts of kindness could make a big difference in someone's life. When it comes to my academic interests, I am passionate about studying the social sciences. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the intersection of economics, political science, and history. These subjects have fascinated me because they provide a framework for understanding the world we live in and how it works. My goal is to use this knowledge to effect positive change in society, possibly by working in public policy or academia. In terms of my personality, I am someone who is persistent and determined. I do not give up easily, and I believe that perseverance is the key to overcoming obstacles. One of the most resilient people in my life is my grandmother. Despite facing numerous challenges, including immigrating to a new country and raising four children on her own, she never lost her spirit or her sense of humor. Her resilience has inspired me, and I try to emulate her example in my own life. In conclusion, the environment in which I was brought up, the experiences that have shaped me, and my academic interests have all contributed to making me the person I am today - someone who is passionate, empathetic, and determined. I believe that attending a school like Yale or Harvard would be the perfect opportunity for me to continue growing and developing into the person I aspire to be. My dream is to use the knowledge and skills I acquire from such a distinguished institution to effect change and make a positive impact on society.",0,2.647353578,2.802589745,2.978492456,3.425066075,2.846036836,14.0,18.0,22.0,27.0,20.0
H,341,"“...everyone believes the world’s greatest lie.” A boy asked, “What’s the world’s greatest lie?” “It’s that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what’s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That’s the world’s greatest lie” –The Alchemist. I was in Mr. Franklin’s World Literature class as he brought Paulo Coelho’s words to life. For me, there was no one point in which my life became controlled by fate. Instead I believed my life was shaped by my ethnicity and the world I grew up in. Mr. Franklin prompted me to take control of my life rather than let fate, and the world’s greatest lie, control who I am. I had believed fate was the only thing that could explain the near impossibility of my parents falling in love. My dad from Taiwan and my mother from Korea, they traveled separately to Australia to learn English. Neither’s English was very good, but they met and found common ground speaking Japanese. A few years later, my mom was wondering what to call her next baby and “Demi” stood out, mainly because Demi has no “l,” “n,” or “f,” so it was easy for both my parents to pronounce. Demi fits me in so many other ways too. Demi represents how my Korean and Taiwanese sides meet in the middle of the American culture in which I study. As I learned how others saw me, it seemed impossible to find a definite answer for who I am. Half did not mean one foot in two cultures; it meant each foot stepping quickly over the hot coals of each culture; I never fit in anywhere. In Korea, I am often made aware that I am not Korean “enough.” While shopping, store clerks seem to intuitively understand I am not entirely Korean—speaking English to me or turning to my mom to answer questions I had asked. I speak fluent Korean and wondered what “gave me away” as a foreigner; looking in the mirror, I suspected my undyed black hair in a sea of trendy brown hair was the culprit. Surprisingly, once I dyed my hair, I was more accepted as Korean. Yet, the minute I started to find my bearings in the Korean half of my life, my grasp of the other eluded me. When I returned to Taiwan where jet black hair is fashionable, people negatively viewed my lightly colored hair—leading to the surreal feeling of being treated as an outsider in my hometown. Even my fluent Mandarin was not enough to shake the assumptions of some. Demi, cutting across two cultures, left me with two seemingly incompatible halves. Eventually, doodling helped me understand how artificial boundaries are. I saw how my creativity often went beyond borders, something instinctive inside me that resisted limitations. During my summer internship with the Bach Institute, a Taipei-based music conservatory, my ability to cross cultures through art found expression in the commemorative T-shirt I designed for performers of the Chelsea Music Festival to mark their trip to Taipei. Uniting the imagery of Taipei and New York in my design allowed me to explore how the cultural forces of Taiwan, Korea, and my American education have shaped my creative expression.​ Growing up between two borders in a world in which everyone else tried to define who I am, Demi has come to represent the whole of me; two sides that may not always be in harmony, but the tension inherent in my identity has empowered me to assert my independence. Mr. Franklin’s speech reminded me that half of life is where you come from and the other half is finding who you want to become. When Mr. Franklin finished reading, I realized that I’m the writer of my story—someone who does not believe the world’s greatest lie.",1,2.489031651,2.860629407,3.10456371,3.519214705,2.98292399,13.2,17.0,22.6,32.6,20.0
C0,342,"As a child of immigrants, I initially struggled to find my place in the world. My parents came from opposite sides of the globe - my father from India and my mother from Mexico - and it felt like I was constantly trying to reconcile these two vastly different parts of my identity. But as I've grown older, I've come to embrace the cultural duality that has shaped me into the person I am today. From an early age, I learned to speak both Hindi and Spanish at home. I celebrated Indian holidays like Diwali and Mexican traditions like Dia de los Muertos. My parents embodied the best of both cultures, infusing our home with the vibrant colors of India and the delicious flavors of Mexico. But as much as I loved both cultures, I felt like I didn't fully belong to either one. At school, I was often asked, 'What are you?' and felt like I couldn't just say 'American.' Being biracial and bilingual felt like a burden, like I was always teetering on the edge of not fitting in anywhere. But over time, I began to see how my unique identity gave me a perspective that others didn't have. When I visited my father's family in India for the first time, I was struck by how different life was there compared to what I was used to in the US. But I also felt an instant connection to my relatives, despite the fact that we had never met before. We shared a common heritage, a bond that transcended language and distance. And when I traveled to Mexico to visit my mother's family, I was similarly struck by the warmth and hospitality of my extended family. Even though we didn't speak the same language fluently, we communicated through shared traditions and customs. As I grew older, I began to see the value in being able to see the world through two different lenses. When I read about the politics of Latin America, I could understand the context and historical background in a way that my monolingual peers couldn't. When I studied Hindi literature, I could appreciate the intricate cultural references that added depth to the stories. By embracing my cultural duality, I gained a richer perspective on life that I wouldn't have had otherwise. But it wasn't until I went to a summer program for bilingual students that I truly understood the power of cultural identity. For the first time, I was surrounded by other kids who shared the same struggles of reconciling two cultures. We bonded over our shared experiences of code-switching and navigating familial expectations. But we also celebrated each other's differences, learning new words and phrases from each other's languages and sharing family recipes. It was a transformative experience, and it made me realize how much I had been missing out on by not fully embracing my cultural heritage. When I got back to school in the fall, I started a cultural club that celebrated diversity and inclusivity. I wanted to create a space where students could learn from each other's cultures and feel comfortable being themselves. It was a small way of giving back and paying forward the lessons I had learned over the years. As I look back on my journey, I realize that the things I once considered drawbacks - not fitting in, feeling like an outsider - were actually blessings in disguise. My cultural duality not only gave me a unique perspective on the world, but it also forced me to be resilient and adaptable. I learned how to navigate two different sets of values and expectations, and I became more comfortable with ambiguity and uncertainty. These are skills that will serve me well in college and beyond, and I'm grateful for the challenges that helped me develop them. Ultimately, my identity is shaped by my family's immigrant experience and the cultural duality that comes with it. But that's not the only thing that defines me. I'm also a student, a friend, a leader, a dreamer. And I know that I have something valuable to offer any community I belong to, whether it's an academic institution or the world at large. By embracing all the pieces of myself and seeing the beauty in each one, I've learned to be proud of who I am and excited for what the future holds.",0,2.681104333,2.869513471,2.998504215,3.090357267,2.918837801,14.2,19.0,21.0,23.8,19.0
C1,343,"One of the ever-present challenges in life is the quest for identity. We all seek to understand who we are and where we belong, and the answer to that question changes as we grow and evolve. However, as a young adult growing up in a country where I do not immediately fit in, discovering my identity has been an adventure that has taken me beyond cultural boundaries. Being of Indian descent, but born and raised in the United States, it is not difficult to feel like an outsider, never quite belonging to one group or the other. Growing up, I celebrated the usual American holidays like Christmas and Halloween, while also taking part in Indian traditions such as Diwali and henna art. Each part of my identity never seemed to fully merge, and I found myself lost between the two. That is until I discovered theatre, which has allowed me to embrace and celebrate the cultural diversity that I carry with me. As a child, I would watch in awe as my father performed in traditional Indian dance shows. I marveled at the way the dancers twirled and moved their bodies, entranced by the rhythmic drumbeats. Over time, this fascination with dance and performance grew into a passion for theatre. Theatre performances require the coming together of various art forms – costume and set design, choreography, music, and acting. It is this very convergence of art that allows for different cultures to flourish together on stage, in harmony, and complementing one another. As a student of theatre, I began to understand that being from two different ethnicities could serve to my advantage in exploring different styles of performance. My passion has helped me discover my identity beyond the mere boundaries and constraints of nationality, race or color. I find myself fascinated by the stories behind different cultures as I explore new theatrical productions. Be it western Broadway musicals or eastern traditional Kathakali dance dramas, by being a part of the audience and the production crew, I am able to appreciate the uniqueness of different cultures. Furthermore, Theatre gave me a platform to celebrate my cultural heritage. I am proud to showcase enduring Indian stories and cultural values with the universal themes of love, honor, and solidarity. It is even more fulfilling that my stories can impart to audience members, from different nationalities or ethnicities, a glimpse into my ethnic heritage and the stories passed down for generations. Through theatre, I have learned that my personality is a blend of my Indian and American upbringing. In essence, I am a cultural hybrid that allows me to bridge different worlds, helping me to navigate and understand the complexities of differing cultures. I have always found myself comfortable, at home in theatre settings where cultures can merge to create something remarkable. Finally, theatre has taught me to embrace the global culture, beyond the diversity I was born into. I have learnt to respect and appreciate the cultural expressions of other people, an important trait in life. I take pride in people's cultural identity and respect the differences that make us unique. In conclusion, the journey of discovering one’s identity involves surprising twists and turns. As I correlate with different diasporas, I have discovered that identity is a personal journey that can be understood beyond the confines of cultural boundaries. I have learned to embrace all the different parts of who I am and have learned that my diversity is my strength. Theatre has given me the freedom to express my unique identity, celebrate my cultural heritage and bridge the gap between different worlds. Theatre has taught me what it means to be truly free, free to be myself - a cultural hybrid. With this understanding, I am more equipped than ever to navigate the complex world we inhabit beyond the confines of our cultures, especially in college.",0,2.740415987,3.062147019,3.185763022,3.34866647,3.109962774,17.0,19.0,22.0,25.0,19.0
C2,344,"In the depths of adolescence, my search for identity seemed to lead me down a path of confusion and discomfort. Straddling two distinct cultures – that of my Indian heritage and my American upbringing – I never quite felt I belonged to either. However, one summer, I found myself wandering lost and aimless around the bustling city streets of Manhattan, when I passed by a theatre marquee. Suddenly, an idea sparked within me like lightning. That night, I watched a Broadway musical, and nothing was ever the same. Theatre had captured me, and I found myself returning to the theatre as a student, seeking to participate and learn in every way possible. Theatre, to me, represented the convergence of so many art forms that allowed for different cultures to come together and flourish—costume and set design, choreography, music, and acting. As a student of theatre, I came to understand that my multicultural roots could contribute to my artistic expression. During my first theatrical production, the experience felt both frightening and exhilarating. As part of the production team, I could hear the sound of the hammers and saws as they worked on building the set for the play. I could smell the paint and wood, feel the roughness of the fabric as I examined the costumes, and see the excitement in the actors' eyes as they practiced their lines. This experience made me realize that I was not only enjoying the art of theatre, but also the process and the hard work put into making something truly remarkable. Theatre was a perfect platform to honor my cultural identity, as it allowed me to learn about different cultures and lifestyles, and create a universe where people of all cultures could celebrate together as one. The musical, Fiddler on the Roof, introduced me to the Jewish Yiddish culture, inspiring me to learn more about it. Through it, I was able to appreciate how the play brought the Yiddish culture to life using singing, music, acting, and dancing. I was also excited when I learned about the Indian theatre art form called the Kathakali dance-drama, and enjoyed watching a live performance. This dance form, a blend of drama, dance, music, and ritual, portrays mythological stories of good versus evil. Theatre taught me the freedom to express myself and my identity, to be comfortable with my cultural hybrid nature. As a student of theatre, I have learned that every culture has unique and fantastic stories to share. Ultimately, theatre has taught me the importance of accepting differences and appreciating diversity. Regardless of nationality or color, people should embrace cultural expressions as they are crucial aspects of identity. We cannot ignore that culture plays a significant role in shaping and defining who we are. In conclusion, theatre has transformed my perspective on life, and my search for identity. It has helped me recognize and embrace my cultural identity, a path that previously felt inscrutable. In the theatre, we appreciate the nuances of character development, and it has taught me how vital it is to celebrate diverse stories, unique perspectives, and the beauty of multiculturalism. Theatre has opened up a new world of creative expression, and I continue to be indebted to its transformative power. As an applicant to top-tier Universities, like Yale and Harvard, I see that theatre can be one of the many avenues through which I can express my unique identity and culture. It gave me the tools I need to navigate a complex and culturally diverse world, and I am better equipped to face the challenges that college might offer. Theatre sparks creativity, empathy, and a deeper understanding of ourselves and others. It has given me the confidence to pursue a life guided by the principle of open-mindedness and a love of diversity.",0,2.871401922,2.968391363,3.187199412,3.587802384,3.133757938,15.6,19.0,22.4,28.0,20.0
H,345,"My mother was 15 years old when I was born. My father has been in prison since my first birthday. He is not coming home. When I was younger, I would go on the long drive with my father’s family to visit him. At first, I enjoyed the two hour long rides; they were adventures. Soon enough, however, those two hours began to feel like two years—I did not want to see him anymore. I did not want to deal with the awkwardness of pretending to be a family and ignoring the fact that he had killed another human being. He was the hero in their stories, but from my mother’s tears, I knew soon enough he was much less than the courageous hero they made him out to be. My father’s family could not accept that I wanted to be as far away from their world of ignorance and verbal abuse as possible. I put up walls to keep them out. It seemed everyone did what they thought was best for me, but never once did they ask how I felt. Eventually, I decided I did not want to exhaust myself trying to care for my identity against their expectations. I closed myself off from the world in order to save myself from drowning in the confusion, manipulation, and emotional drama I battled every day. Over time, this became too difficult. The mental torture of feeling lost in my own mind was worse than what awaited outside of the walls. This past September, I faced one of the tallest and widest walls: my name. For nearly 17 years, I lived with my father’s name—“Reyes.” I was Angellica Reyes. I am now Angellica Diaz. More aware of my past and the realities of my life, I chose to sever off the only connection to my father I had left, his name. I was now the “villain” of his family’s stories. Yet, I believed this action would finally release me from my walls because it would erase my past. I wanted to forget that I had wasted 17 years shutting myself away. All my life I had believed I found strength in silence and reservation. Now, I am deeply ashamed that it took me 17 years to realize vulnerability is the truest measure of our strength and character. I regret my silence. I understand now that a name can not fix the void I have created for myself. I know these walls will hold me for years to come, but today I acknowledge that I will always be a product of the past. What matters is I am still searching for that place that exists free from the walls. Today, I do not allow spite or hate to faze me or my visions for the world. I am grounded and balanced. From living in the shadow of ignorance I am now driven to change the lives of others, to inspire with peace and compassion. I am fighting hunger and food waste in my community, I will soon start teaching yoga classes to underprivileged children, and I hope to start a healthy lifestyle education program at my local youth center. My confidence stems from the understanding that as an active agent, the world I envision is the world that will be. I am still breaking through a world blocked behind walls but no longer do I wait for the world to change. Every day I challenge my family’s categorization of my place in the world. Today, I will not wait for anyone’s approval. I am not coming home.",1,2.361186033,2.601785819,2.762380401,2.92041213,2.671346707,8.2,13.4,18.6,23.0,16.0
C0,346,"Growing up, I had always thought of vulnerability as a weakness. I was taught to bottle up my emotions, put on a brave face, and never let anyone see me cry. I believed that vulnerability was an invitation for ridicule and rejection. As a result, I built up emotional walls, walls that I thought would protect me from the painful emotions I was too scared to confront. But little did I know that breaking through those walls would open up a world of strength and resilience that I never knew existed. It wasn't until my junior year of high school that I found myself at a breaking point. I was juggling school, sports, and extracurricular activities, all while trying to navigate the ups and downs of teenage life. I was drowning in stress and anxiety, but I didn't want people to know. I was determined to tough it out on my own. Until one day, I broke down. I couldn't take it anymore. I found myself in a counselor's office, tears streaming down my face as I spilled my heart out to a complete stranger. It was then that I realized the true power of vulnerability. Opening up about my struggles allowed me to break through the emotional walls I had built up for so long. It was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I was no longer carrying the burden of my emotions by myself. I was able to connect with others on a deeper level, as I realized that I wasn't the only one facing challenges. Through vulnerability, I was able to find a network of support and understanding that I had never experienced before. Breaking through emotional walls is not easy. It requires us to be brave and honest with ourselves and others. It forces us to confront our fears and insecurities head-on. But when we do, the rewards are immeasurable. Vulnerability allows us to tap into a strength that we never knew existed. It enables us to connect with others on a deeper level, to empathize with their struggles, and to find comfort in shared experiences. One of the barriers to vulnerability is the fear of judgment. We are afraid that if we let our guard down, we will be seen as weak or less than perfect. But the truth is, vulnerability is not a flaw. It is a source of power. It is through our vulnerabilities that we connect with others in ways that we never thought possible. It is through our struggles that we find strength and resilience. In my experience, vulnerability is not an overnight process. It is a journey, one that requires patience and self-compassion. It requires us to take small steps towards opening up, to be gentle with ourselves as we navigate the unfamiliar terrain of our emotions. It requires us to be vulnerable with people who we trust, people who we know will support us in our journey. For me, one of the most rewarding experiences of vulnerability has been the discovery of my passion for writing. Through writing, I have found an outlet to express my emotions in a way that feels safe and authentic. I have been able to connect with others through my writing, sharing my vulnerabilities and struggles with an audience that I never knew existed. Breaking through emotional walls is not just a personal journey; it is a journey that we can take collectively. By being vulnerable with one another, we create a safe space for others to do the same. We open up a dialogue of understanding and support, a dialogue that is essential for building strong and resilient communities. As I prepare to embark on the next stage of my life, I am grateful for the lessons that breaking through my emotional walls has taught me. I have learned that vulnerability is not a weakness, but a source of power. I have learned that it takes courage to let our guard down and trust others with our emotions. And I have learned that by breaking through our emotional walls, we can connect with others in ways that we never thought possible. So here's to breaking through emotional walls — one step, one tear, one word at a time.

C1,347,"Growing up, I was always taught to put up walls around my emotions. My parents were the kind of people who believed in the “tough love” philosophy, where showing emotion or vulnerability was seen as weakness. As a result, I learned to keep my feelings to myself and never let anyone in. For a while, it worked. I was able to navigate through life without any significant emotional upheavals. But as I got older and faced new challenges, I realized that my emotional walls had become more of a hindrance than a help. It wasn't until I experienced a major loss in my life that I began to understand the importance of breaking down my walls. A close family member passed away after a long battle with cancer and I was overcome with grief. But instead of leaning on my friends and family for support, I isolated myself and tried to deal with the pain on my own. It wasn't until I hit my breaking point that I realized I needed to do something about it. I reached out to a therapist, and slowly but surely, I began to break down the walls around my emotions. It wasn't easy, but it was worth it. Breaking down my emotional walls has allowed me to develop deeper, more meaningful relationships with the people in my life. By being vulnerable and honest about my feelings, I’ve been able to connect with others on a level I never thought was possible. I’ve learned that true strength lies in our ability to be vulnerable and to allow others to do the same. Breaking down emotional walls has also helped me to better understand and manage my own emotions. Instead of bottling things up until I reach my breaking point, I’ve learned to recognize and express my feelings in a healthy way. This has helped me to feel more in control of my emotions and to be more present in my daily life. What I’ve learned through this experience is that our emotional walls can be both a blessing and a curse. They can protect us from harm, but they can also prevent us from connecting with others on a deeper level. Breaking down these walls isn’t easy, but it’s essential if we want to lead fulfilling, healthy lives. The first step in breaking down your emotional walls is to acknowledge that they exist. It can be scary to confront the emotions you’ve been holding back for so long, but it’s the only way to move forward. For me, this meant admitting that I needed help from a professional. The next step is to start practicing vulnerability. This can mean opening up to a trusted friend or family member, or it can mean seeking out therapy. Whatever you choose, it’s important to remember that vulnerability is a gradual process. You don’t have to share everything at once, but take small steps towards opening up. It’s also important to be kind to yourself throughout this process. Breaking down emotional walls isn’t easy, and it can be overwhelming at times. But remember that every step you take towards vulnerability is a step in the right direction. In conclusion, breaking down emotional walls is a journey that requires patience, self-reflection, and courage. It’s not always easy, but it’s essential for personal growth and connection with others. I’ve learned that vulnerability and emotional expression are not weaknesses, but the truest measures of our strength and character. By breaking down my walls, I’ve been able to deepen my relationships with others and learn to manage my emotions in a healthy way. I encourage anyone who may be struggling with their own emotional walls to seek out help and start taking small steps towards vulnerability.

C2,348,"Growing up, I was taught to be a stoic and unemotional person. My parents were always adamant that crying or showing vulnerability was a weakness rather than a strength. I never realized how this would affect me until I became an adult. As I grew older, I realized that I had become an expert in keeping my emotions under wraps. I never showed my emotions; I had mastered the poker face. However, as life started to get more hectic, I realized that my feelings were getting the best of me. It all started when I lost someone very dear to me. They had fought valiantly against cancer but eventually succumbed to it. I was devastated, and my emotions had consumed me. However, instead of opening up and reaching out to my loved ones, I bottled everything inside me. My emotional walls became denser and more impenetrable. Somehow, I managed to get through every day with grit and determination. I knew that I couldn't let my emotions get the best of me. It wasn't until I started noticing how this coping mechanism was affecting me that I realized that I needed to let the walls around me crumble. It wasn't easy, but I knew that I needed to seek help to break down my emotional walls. I made an appointment with a therapist, and I started peeling away at the protective layer that I had created to keep myself safe. I had to open myself up to allow myself to heal, and it was not without resistance. It was scary, but it allowed me to connect with a part of me that I had suppressed for too long. An unexpected benefit of breaking down my emotional walls was the discovery of new or improved relationships. I found that, by allowing myself to be vulnerable, people around me started to reveal their own vulnerabilities, allowing me to connect with them on a deeper level. My friendships and relationships became stronger and more authentic, and I noticed that people became more comfortable around me. It wasn't just about opening up to others. I started to open up to myself, revealing many thoughts and feelings that had been locked away for years. It was liberating, and I started to see life in a new light. Now, whenever I experience a challenging moment, I allow myself to feel the emotions that come with it rather than trying to hold them back. This helped me to develop a better understanding of my emotional shortcomings and taught me how to deal with different emotional scenarios. I realized that it was okay to feel vulnerable sometimes and that there was strength in that. My emotional intelligence improved, allowing me to show more empathy towards others and their feelings. Breaking down my emotional walls was a tough experience, but it truly transformed me into a better person. I don't believe that I could have become the person I am today without letting those walls break down. I encourage anyone who feels like they have emotional walls up to taking the steps to bring them down. The first step is to seek some support or therapy. You don't have to unload all your emotional baggage at once, though. In the beginning, it can just be little steps towards being more vulnerable. Once you take these baby steps, be kind to yourself. Breaking down emotional walls is a journey; it doesn't happen overnight. Don't beat yourself up if you need more time to open up. In summary, everyone has emotional walls at some point in their lives; it's human nature. Unfortunately, sometimes this can be a hindrance rather than a support system. Breaking these walls down is not only courageous but essential to personal growth and more profound relationships with ourselves and others. I learned that being vulnerable isn't a weakness, but a strength that we all have within us. And finally, by uncovering what lays within our emotional walls, one can achieve a better understanding of oneself, leading to a happier and healthier lifestyle.",0,2.29195617,2.489614245,2.614912797,2.734775807,2.543854495,11.2,13.0,17.0,19.0,17.0
H,349,"My name is Oussama. Yes, it is pronounced Osama. Growing up with this name, especially post 9-11, was not easy. Although it’s spelled differently, the reaction produced is still the same. I will always remember the painful first days of every new school year, but I particularly recall my first day of eighth grade. I dreaded morning attendance. As the teacher moved down her roster, past the L’s and the M’s, my heart thumped furiously. With the O’s looming closer, I wanted to grow smaller. When she got to my name, she paused for what seemed like an eternity. A look of confusion crossed her face, and then her mouth writhed in a feeble attempt to say my name: Oussama Ouadani. I meekly mumbled a “here.” Shocked, all of the students swiveled in their seats to gawk at me, and a few muffled snickers arose from the edges of the class. Eyes probed my Algerian features, and I sat with cheeks ablaze, wondering what they made of me. I remember going home and crying, wishing that I had a “normal” name, or at the least, a middle name I could use. It became so unbearable that I even questioned my parents’ choice to name me Oussama. Looking back, I realize that these awkward days of school have revealed a great deal to me about human nature. My name in Arabic means the lion, the brave. To others, I’ve found out, it may mean a whole host of things. I work at Staples, where I wear a name badge that openly states who I am. I get different reactions to it each day. Some people get nervous as a result of my nametag. They glance at it surreptitiously, and then delicately look back at me. Some people are more blatant about it and stare, shamelessly, at my nametag. Some question it, curious about its pronunciation and its roots. Some try to sympathize with the troubles my name has brought me. But then there are those, a very select few, who simply call me “Oussama.” Even though it is such a basic form of respect, it always catches me off guard. It makes me feel normal. I don’t want people to be afraid of my name, or falsely sympathize with me. I simply wish to be me. Although my name has been an object of hardship, it has also been my greatest teacher. It has put me in positions characterized by emotions ranging from irritation to humiliation. However, I believe these situations have served as the catalyst for my growth in character, and as result, I am a more resilient person. The fact that I no longer want to change my name proves this. My name also acts as a portal through which I can empathize with others. I grasp what it means to truly respect someone, to the core, so they feel important. I appreciate what it means to feel ostracized. I know what it’s like to be shamed by others, and how it feels to reject your own name, your sole identifier, your individuality. Being laughed at has taught me not to laugh at others. Being shunned has taught me to open my arms to others. Being pitied, I’ve learned not to pity others. I try my best to consider the struggles of others, and why their actions and words may be the product of a storied past. I sympathize with the shy, the loud, and the attention seekers. It has allowed me to acknowledge that potentially everyone has a secret fear or personal struggle that I might not know about. My name is an integral component of who I am, for not only does it reflect my cultural heritage and lend me a visionary quality, but it also represents an eternal gift from my parents.",1,2.233520566,2.447885648,2.631704902,2.963128562,2.588194064,9.4,11.8,15.0,22.0,13.0
C0,350,"Growing up, I never thought much about my Arabic name. It was simply a part of who I was, a name given to me by my parents who wanted to honor our cultural heritage. But as I got older and began to navigate the world outside of my family and community, I quickly realized that my name often came with its own set of challenges. Being named Fatima in a country that sometimes conflates Muslim with terrorist hasn’t been easy. I’ve heard the whispers and seen the nervous glances when I introduce myself, especially in the wake of terrorist attacks carried out by individuals who share my faith. At times, it’s felt like my name has been a burden, something that I’ve had to explain or defend to people who assume the worst of me. But at the same time, my name has also been a source of pride and identity. It’s a reminder of where I come from and the values that my parents instilled in me. Despite the challenges it has presented, I wouldn’t change my name for the world. One of the most difficult things about having an Arabic name is the constant mispronunciations. I’ve lost count of the number of times that people have stumbled over my name, trying to force an English pronunciation onto a word that simply doesn’t work that way. Even when people mean well, it can be frustrating to have to correct them over and over again, to explain that the “i” is pronounced like an “e” and the “a” like an “ah.” But as frustrating as it can be, these mispronunciations have also been a learning opportunity. They’ve forced me to be patient, to explain my name and my culture in a way that is accessible to those who may not be familiar with it. They’ve also given me a sense of connection to other people with non-English names, because I know that I’m not alone in this struggle. Another challenge of having an Arabic name is the assumptions that people make about me based solely on my name. There have been times when I’ve introduced myself to someone and could tell by their reaction that they weren’t expecting me to look the way that I do. People have assumed that I’m uneducated or oppressed, that I don’t speak English well, that I’m somehow less American than they are. These assumptions have been hurtful at times, but they’ve also made me more aware of the ways in which we judge people based on their names or appearances. It’s a reminder that there is still much work to be done in this country when it comes to tolerance and acceptance, and that it’s up to all of us to fight against these harmful stereotypes. Perhaps one of the biggest challenges of having an Arabic name has been navigating the post-9/11 world. While I was only six years old when the attacks happened, I still remember the fear and confusion that gripped my community in the aftermath. Suddenly, my name and my faith were under suspicion, and I felt like I had to prove that I was just as American as anyone else. Over the years, as anti-Muslim rhetoric and hate crimes have increased, that sense of fear and anxiety hasn’t gone away. There have been times when I’ve been afraid to tell people my name, especially in certain parts of the country where Islamophobia is more prevalent. But despite that fear, I’ve continued to stand by my name and my faith, refusing to let others define who I am or what I believe. In many ways, having an Arabic name has been a microcosm of the larger struggles faced by marginalized communities in this country. It’s a constant battle to be seen and heard, to have our stories and experiences validated, to be treated with the dignity and respect that we deserve. But despite the challenges, my name – Fatima – is still a part of me, still a symbol of my identity and heritage. And I wouldn’t want it any other way. In a world that can sometimes feel hostile to people who are different, it’s easy to lose hope or give up in the face of discrimination. But I believe that the key to overcoming these challenges is to refuse to be silenced, to stand up for what we believe in, and to fight for a world that is welcoming and inclusive for all. That’s what my name has taught me, and it’s a lesson that I hope to carry with me as I continue on this journey called life.",0,2.882308891,2.94215593,3.028780093,3.192525336,3.000037016,17.0,23.4,26.0,28.0,25.0
C1,351,"My name has always been something that sets me apart. It is not a common name, and it is often mispronounced and misspelled. However, unlike the author of 'My Name is My Way,' my name was not culturally significant. It was simply a name that my parents loved and felt was unique. Throughout my life, I have been faced with different reactions to my name, some positive and some negative. But rather than feeling ashamed or embarrassed, I have learned to embrace my name for its uniqueness and the opportunities it has given me to stand out. As a child, I remember feeling a sense of dread whenever a new teacher would take attendance. My name was always the last on the list, and I would wait in anxious anticipation, knowing that the teacher was about to butcher my name. However, as I got older, I began to see the humor in the situation. While my peers had more conventional names, my name was always a topic of conversation. People would ask where it came from or how to pronounce it, and it helped me connect with others on a deeper level. Growing up, I also struggled with the limited availability of personalized items with my name on them. I could never find a pencil or keychain with my name on it in gift shops or stores. While this may seem like a small issue, it contributed to feeling left out of mainstream culture. However, instead of feeling disheartened by this, I learned to find humor in it. When my friends would find personalized items with their names on them, I would jokingly ask to borrow it since I never had any myself. Over time, I realized that having a unique name was a positive attribute. It served as a way to distinguish me from the crowd and to make me more memorable to others. It helped break the ice in social situations and gave me an opportunity to talk about my family or cultural heritage. Despite the positives, there were still times when my name made me feel embarrassed or ashamed. It was frustrating when people would consistently mispronounce or misspell my name, and it made me feel like I did not fit in. However, as I got older, I realized that people's inability to pronounce my name was not a reflection of me or my worth. Rather, it highlighted the limitations of their own experiences and knowledge. In fact, as I began applying to colleges, I realized that my name could actually be an asset. In my essays and interviews, my name was often a topic of conversation, and it helped me stand out from the thousands of other applicants. It was something that people remembered, and it helped bring a bit of personality to my application. Through my experiences with my name, I have learned to embrace my differences and to celebrate what makes me unique. Society often encourages us to try and fit in, to be like everyone else. But my name has taught me that standing out is not a bad thing. It has helped me become more comfortable in my own skin and has given me the confidence to be my authentic self. Ultimately, our names are a reflection of who we are and where we come from. They can serve as a source of pride or a burden, depending on how we choose to view them. For me, my name has been a bit of both. But as I continue to embrace my uniqueness, I am grateful for the opportunities it has given me to stand out and for the ways in which it has helped me grow into the person I am today.",0,2.424529154,2.587069083,2.749804192,2.93845347,2.63642688,14.0,16.2,18.0,23.0,17.0
C2,352,"I distinctly remember the first day of middle school, anxious and fidgety, waiting for the teacher to call out names on the attendance list. I knew my name would be at the bottom, and dreaded the inevitable butchering that would ensue. However, as expected, when the teacher finally got to my name, she stumbled and stuttered in confusion. A wave of laughter swept through the classroom, and I felt mortified. In that moment, I wanted nothing more than to blend in with the crowd and hide my unique identifier away. As I grew up, my name became a barometer of sorts, measuring how comfortable I felt in my own skin. Sometimes it was a source of pride and joy, while other times it was a setback that made me feel out of place. However, I began to realize that it was not my name that was the problem, but rather other people's limitations. Personally, I have always been drawn to the unconventional, from the unique names given to people, to the offbeat places I enjoy visiting. Because of this, I quickly learned to embrace my name's peculiarities. Although my name was not culturally significant, it was unconventional and rarely heard, and I eventually found it to be a badge of honor. It became a topic of conversation that allowed me to form connections with others who were different like me. Indeed, my name was a symbol of my identity, a distinct stamp that set me apart from the herd. However, not everyone reacted to my name with the same amount of positivity. I recall an instance in high school when a substitute teacher refused to acknowledge my name, insisting that I must have a westernized nickname. I could see the contempt in her eyes, her arrogance growing as she demanded that I comply with her expectations. In that instance, my name became a sign of oppression, and instead of embracing it, I felt ashamed. Yet, my name continued to unfurl as a symbol of resistance against conformity. It reminded me to always remain true to myself, regardless of external pressure. Just like how your name sticks with you for life, your individuality is something that is unique and irreversible. And when you learn to embrace your ideas, your quirks, your peculiarities, you can face the world with renewed vigor. There was a time when I was self-conscious about having a name that was so different from my friend's names. With time, though, I learned to appreciate that it was perfectly fine to be different. In fact, I learned to be proud of my differences. By embracing my name, I was able to embrace my individuality. As I began applying to colleges, my name became an asset to me. It set me aside from the crowd of applicants, and I utilized it as a way to stand out. Over time, I learned that it was not my name that needed to change, but rather society's attitudes and biases that needed to evolve. Through my experiences with my name, I have learned the power of individuality. And that by embracing our unique, unconventional qualities, we are doing something revolutionary - we are embracing ourselves wholly and unapologetically. I've come a long way since the first day of middle school, and now, when someone mispronounces my name, I simply correct them without a hint of embarrassment. In my life, my name has become a symbol of my individuality, representing my quirks, my strengths, and my weaknesses. My name is an emblem of my history, my future, and my present. It allows me to stand out from the crowd and showcase everything that makes me unique. I am no longer afraid to be different or to stand out, but rather, I embrace it because it is what makes me, me. The power of one's name and individuality is immeasurable, and it should never be something to hide or keep hidden away.",0,2.532065661,2.69654734,2.776062137,2.917858987,2.717094322,13.0,18.0,20.0,23.0,19.0
H,353,"Christmas has always made me happy. The mountains are glossed by snow as the nearby branches hang low from the weight of the recent blizzard. The smell of fresh Maine pine trees and burning wood fill the crisp air. My family decorates the tree humming along to James Taylor’s Christmas album. But above all else, at the focal point of every Sheehan Christmas, is my favorite Christmas movie, It’s A Wonderful Life. The movie follows the life of George Bailey, who, after many years of selflessness runs into a financial crisis. As George begins to act out, family and friends ask God to help him through his tough times. In response, God sends an angel named Clarence to sort out the issue. George asks to see a world in which he was never born to which Clarence reluctantly obliges. In this new George-less world, George witnesses a dreary, alternative universe in which all of his family and friends lead miserable lives. Seeing this allows George to see how important his life actually is and he begs God to let him live again. The story is meant to show people what is truly meaningful in life—that, whether they realize it or not, one person’s actions can cause a positive ripple effect in the lives of so many. To say this movie is my personal Bible is an understatement. It’s A Wonderful Life has been the centerpiece of many dinner conversations and family gatherings. I try to bring it up as often as possible because it gives me an appreciation for the lives of those around me. Each person’s life touches so many, and when that person isn’t around, there’s an awful hole that can’t be filled. Certainly there are other influences in my life, but none have quite affected my definition of what it means to live well. I have the choice to be an integral part of everyone’s life. The movie particularly made me curious about people’s passions and caused me to do a lot of self-reflection. I couldn’t remember the last time I asked the people closest to me what it was that made them happiest; I couldn’t tell you their favorite things, or much about their personal lives. These were some of the most important people in my life and I couldn’t even understand why they were the way they were. There’s a difference between knowing someone on the surface and truly knowing who they are. It’s A Wonderful Life encouraged me to delve into the lives of those around me. There’s a line from another great movie, Patch Adams, that says: “Our job is to improve the quality of life, not just delay death.” The message resonates well with what It’s A Wonderful Life did for me. It’s easy to get caught up in our personal lives and not worry about the surrounding world. But what’s easy is not always what’s best. My biggest fear is to have the opposite effect that George Bailey had—If I were to not be a part of the world, that nobody’s life would be different. So I’ve dedicated my life to making sure that every day I seek to improve the quality of life of those around me. Every person I’ve met, every relationship I’ve had, every hello I’ve said, my actions stem from the lessons I’ve learned in It’s A Wonderful Life. I now realize that I can have a serious impact on the lives of those around me. I’m more curious, I’m more engaging, I’m more positive in my relationships with other people all because of a two hour and fifteen minute Christmas movie. Every year, as the snow begins to fall, as the temperature drops, as I set up my family’s nativity scene, I can’t help but feel excitement knowing that it’s time to watch It’s A Wonderful Life again, the movie that changed my life.",1,2.513322226,2.821426165,3.059096134,3.356945773,2.932807302,14.2,17.4,21.0,24.6,19.0
C0,354,"When I was nine years old, my parents sat me down to watch a classic movie they claimed was a must-see. It was called 'It's A Wonderful Life.' Though at that age, I didn't quite understand the intricate plot or the underlying themes, there was one lesson from the movie that struck a chord in me even at that young age: The impact we have on those around us is immeasurable. As I grew older, I began to appreciate the movie’s significance and understand the higher purpose it offered. The story is about George Bailey, a man who has given up his dreams to help others in his hometown of Bedford Falls, ultimately becoming suicidal on Christmas Eve. An angel named Clarence intervenes, showing George what life would have been like if he had never been born. The movie culminates in George returning to reality, recognizing that his life has been anything but insignificant. 'It's A Wonderful Life' was initially released in December 1946 and was received with lukewarm enthusiasm. Although the film didn't pull in the desired revenue back in the day, little did anyone know that it would eventually become a cherished holiday tradition for decades to come. Year after year, families bond over the emotional journey of George Bailey and are reminded of the fragility of life. However, the movie's influence extends past mere entertainment value. If you went around asking people what the movie taught them and the effect it had on their lives, you would undoubtedly receive an array of answers. The film has left a lasting impact on our society and culture, shaping us in ways we may not even be aware of. One of the main takeaways from the movie is the power of human connection. George Bailey is a man who constantly puts others before himself, and this is what makes him a hero. In a world that can be ruthlessly individualistic, it’s refreshing to see someone so selfless. His compassion touches even the most ornery people in his town. It shows that we are all interconnected, and our existence can make all the difference in someone’s life. Additionally, 'It's A Wonderful Life' conveys the importance of pursuing our dreams, a theme that resonates with me as a high school senior contemplating what's ahead. George Bailey has given up the pursuit of his aspirations to cater to the needs of Bedford Falls, but in the end, he finds that he has made an impact on his community that far outweighs any material success. The movie reminds us that life isn't solely about achieving what we want, but what we can do for others. 'It's A Wonderful Life' also highlights the necessity of mental health awareness. The movie was made in an era where mental health struggles were not acknowledged as they are now, yet the portrayal of suicidal ideation and depression in the movie is striking. George Bailey had reached rock bottom, and suicide seemed like a viable option to relieve his pain. It wasn't until Clarence intervened and showed him what life would have been without him that George realized he was not alone and that his life had meaning. This message is especially pertinent in today's world, where the pressures of social, academic, and personal life can create a sense of despair in so many young people. Lastly, 'It's A Wonderful Life' teaches us the importance of cherishing the present moment. George Bailey is a man who continually puts his life on hold to cater to others, but it's a decision that ultimately works in his favor. In a world that is consistently on the go, we understand that it is important to take the time to appreciate the present and to those around us daily; we cannot savour every minute of our lives, which will ultimately culminate into a fulfilling journey. In the end, the film offers a convincing message. It acknowledges that life is challenging and can sometimes overshadow the good that we do, but that it is within our power to still make a positive impact, all while encouraging us to show gratitude to those things with which we come into contact. 'It's A Wonderful Life' has had a profound impact on me through the years, such that I now recognize the significance to which the universal lessons speaks to people of all generations, linking past and present. It has made me more aware of the need to appreciate those around me, to pursue my dreams while being empathetic to others, and to be understanding towards the importance of mental health. When I watch it now, I do so with much more awareness and appreciation for the lessons it teaches. As I apply to Ivy League schools, I hope that 'It's A Wonderful Life' illustrates the impact I would like to make on this world. I aspire to use my experiences and education to make positive changes on important social issues, and most importantly, to make a difference in the lives of those around me. The movie is a reminder that, as we pursue our passions and ambitions, we also bear the responsibility to be considerate of those around us and create a positive legacy. In sum, the movie ”It's A Wonderful Life” has transcended its genre to become a classic and influential piece of culture for each generation. The movie is testament to the effect one single life can have on the people around us, from the people we know intimately to the people we seldom meet. That joy in touching an individual’s life never fades away, and the film has ensured that It never will.",0,2.761071016,3.103325409,3.298856307,3.563453267,3.200866354,15.8,19.0,26.0,30.0,22.0
C1,355,"Christmas is always an exciting time, and for me, nothing brings more joy than watching 'It's A Wonderful Life.' This classic movie tells the story of George Bailey, an altruistic man who has always put others before himself. After facing a crisis, George contemplates suicide, but an angel named Clarence intervenes and shows him how his life has made a positive impact on those around him. The movie has had a profound effect on me since I first saw it at a young age. It taught me that every person has the power to make a difference in the world, no matter how small their actions may seem. George Bailey's story illuminates the power of human connection. Countless times, he tries to put others before himself, bringing them food, helping them find shelter and work. His love for his wife, Mary, is evident throughout the movie, and his willingness to go to jail for his friend's mistake shows how much he values human connection. This selflessness speaks to our modern-day society, which is often individualistic and prone to neglecting community. George shows us that by alleviating others’ sorrows, our own sorrows become less significant. The movie also emphasizes the importance of pursuing our passions. George is a man who initially desires to travel the world in pursuit of his dreams. However, after numerous circumstances cause him to stay in Bedford Falls, he begins to see the impact he has on his community. The film reminds us that the pursuit of happiness should not be limited to personal goals, but should also extend to how we contribute positively to society. 'It's A Wonderful Life' also highlights the ongoing importance of mental health awareness. Suicide and depression are still taboo topics in our present society as they were in the 1930s and 40s when the movie was set. While the portrayal of these illnesses in the movie is not close to how they manifest in reality in the modern-day, what brings the movie up to date is that George's downward spiral is symbolic of the struggles people face in their mental health. Lastly, the movie stresses the necessity of being present in every moment. George Bailey has continually put his own aspirations on hold to cater to the needs of everyone around him. In the end, his persistence in making sacrifices for others is what makes him a hero. The movie reminds us that instead of focusing on what the future holds, we should take note of the present moment and live in it wholly. 'It's A Wonderful Life' teaches us that regardless of how insignificant we may perceive our actions to be, they have a positive impact on the lives of those around us. Despite George's eventual breakdown, the movie doesn't show this moment as weakness, but rather as an opportunity for a life-transforming perspective shift. After realizing that his friends and family would be worse off without him, George's mental state reverses dramatically. He learns that life is much larger than one person and even if it seemed that way before, every decision we make has grand consequences on those around us. In conclusion, 'It's A Wonderful Life' has shone light on the most important aspect of life—mutual human concern— and amplified how our actions of simple kindness can have the grandest of impacts. It has played a vital role in shaping the way we think today and has imprinted upon us from an earlier age the virtues of altruism and community, which has transpired for many years. By keeping George Bailey's story close and within our hearts, we too can make an affirmative impact on the world. The movie has inspired me to be kind, compassionate, and empathetic, and to remember always that no matter how small an act may seem, it can make a world of difference.",0,2.872539525,3.052616509,3.278105496,3.394142374,3.230666386,16.0,19.0,23.6,29.0,20.0

We hang ornaments from the branches and add the final touches to our holiday decor. James Taylor's Christmas album plays in the background while we prepare for one of our favorite holiday traditions: watching It's a Wonderful Life. The movie's magic never fades, no matter the number of times we watch it. It tells the tale of George Bailey, a small-town man with big dreams of traveling the world and accomplishing great things. Still, life has other plans for him, and he is forced to put his aspirations aside to help others. His story teaches us about the importance of family, friends, and community. George Bailey's unwavering sense of resilience is something that has always left a significant impression on me. I remember one scene where George's beloved Uncle Billy loses some important money. Despite the circumstances and the troubles that follow, George remains steadfast, determined to do whatever it takes to recover the lost funds. This unwavering determination has inspired me to become one of the most resilient people in my own life, refusing to give up in the face of adversity. The movie's message extends beyond the Christmas season. It teaches us about the importance of kindness, empathy and the power of our actions to change someone's life. George Bailey's selflessness and dedication to serving his community inspire me to strive for a similar level of service to others. The movie's message about the significance of community has pushed me to give back to the community, volunteer at charities and make a positive difference in people's lives. As I prepare to transition to college, it has become even more important to build connections and relationships that can help me become the person I aspire to be. The movie's message about the power of friendship has taught me to cherish those in my life, especially the people who help me grow and develop. As the movie draws to a close, George Bailey's selflessness has him reach a life-changing epiphany. He realizes that even if he abandoned his hopes for worldly success, his life has been anything but insignificant. He has made a meaningful and significant difference in the world. We gather on the couch and watch the final scene, wiping away our tears. We come away with renewed hope and a sense of purpose in our hearts. As George Bailey once said, 'Remember, no man is a failure who has friends.'

I will forever treasure this timeless masterpiece, as it has inspired me to lead a life that makes the world a better place.

H,357,"I am a dancer. It’s something I’ve only learned recently, but it’s my reality. My story is not one of the typical dancer: I was not the student who couldn’t sit still or pay attention in class, only to find focus and expression through movement. That just isn’t my story. I’ve always been able to sit still, stay engaged, and absorb what my teachers threw at me: I was a “good student”. I would sit at my desk, listen and learn, then go home and do my homework. But, the entire time I embodied that “good student”, I felt like something was missing. It wasn’t physical health—I stayed active and had a healthy diet. But, there was a disconnect between my mind and body. For the longest time, I felt like I lived from the neck up. I love to learn —I always have—but before dance, I was only focused on learning with my head. At the beginning of my junior year I picked up dance. It started on a bit of a whim: I liked watching and I thought learning some moves would help me impress girls. So, I grabbed a like-minded friend and started attending classes. Once I began, I was surprised by how much I liked it. I had discovered something in it that I hadn’t been expecting; I found that I was learning with my entire body. Not to mention that at the same time, I was learning about my body itself—how it worked and moved, every little muscle and bone. My friend eventually quit, but I kept attending class, and began to add more and more classes to my schedule. I dove deep into dance and took every opportunity that I could find to learn. Dancing was like returning to my childhood, like learning to take those first steps. I was learning how my body moved, how to challenge and develop it, and how to interact with other people through a new language. It challenged me in a completely new way and I’ve loved every second of it. Dance has changed my life. Through it, I’ve met people who challenge my beliefs about how the world works and how we all learn. It’s shown me many different paths and ways to navigate through life. I’ve found role models in my teachers who engage me mentally and physically and push me to grow; teachers who I am lucky enough to also call my friends. I’ve found a global and local community of hardworking, intelligent, and skilled people who are always hungry to learn; a community where everyone is accepted, because dance transcends everything—race, class, gender, religion, even language. And for the first time, I’ve found a community where I am fully supported and accepted; a feeling, it seems, that I had never experienced before. Through all of this, I have found a part of my identity and I am proud to call myself a dancer because of it.",1,2.435756773,2.608434534,2.735826982,2.877427706,2.658683675,10.6,14.2,18.8,24.0,15.0
C0,358,"When I was five, my parents signed me up for ballet lessons. It started as a simple after-school activity, but soon it turned into a passion that I could not let go of. Dancing became my outlet for emotions, my way of expression and a constant force in my life. My journey to become a dancer was not an easy one, but it shaped me into the person I am today. My earliest memories of dance are a blur of sparkly tutus and pink ballet shoes. I was always a shy child and dance provided me with a platform where I could express myself in a way that words could not. It gave me confidence, a sense of discipline and the determination to succeed. As I grew older, I became more serious about my dance. I added jazz and contemporary to my repertoire and started performing at local events. I loved the adrenaline rush that came with being on stage, the feeling of moving in sync with others and the knowledge that people were appreciating my hard work. In high school, I joined the school dance team which was an entirely different experience. There was a lot more focus on technique, stamina and endurance. But even then, dance remained more than just a sport for me. It was a way of life. It gave me a sense of purpose, and every time I put on my dance shoes, I felt like I was ready to take on the world. But the path to pursuing dance as a career was not straightforward. My parents wanted me to have a stable job, one that would guarantee me a steady income and a comfortable life. They did not see dance as a viable option. But my love for the art was too strong to ignore. Dance became my escape from the pressures of school, the expectations of society and the difficulties of growing up. It was my sanctuary when I felt lost, my source of happiness when I was down and my anchor when everything around me seemed to be changing. As I applied to colleges, I made sure to select programs that would allow me to continue dancing. It was a priority for me. But sitting down to write the essays brought up a wave of self-doubt. How could I convince someone else that dance was a valid career option? That it was my true passion? That’s when I realized that my journey to become a dancer was more than just a series of dance lessons and rehearsals. It was a story of perseverance, dedication and a willingness to chase my dreams. The more I reflected on my dance journey, the more I saw how it had shaped me as a person. I learned the importance of hard work, of pushing past my limits and of collaborating with others in pursuit of a common goal. Dancing also taught me the value of failure. I have fallen countless times, been turned down from shows and competitions, and have had moments where I have doubted my skills. But each time, I picked myself up and tried again. I learned to embrace my mistakes and use them as an opportunity to learn and grow. Most importantly, my journey to become a dancer taught me the value of patience. Progress in dance, like many other things in life, is not always linear. There are moments of rapid improvement followed by long periods of stagnancy. But I learned to appreciate the slow progress, to trust in the process and to keep moving forward even when it felt like I was stuck. Dance has been a constant in my life, through the good and the bad. When everything else around me was changing, dance remained a beacon of consistency. It has taught me that change is not something to fear, but rather something to embrace with open arms. So, as I write this essay and look towards the future, I know that dance will always be a part of who I am. It is not just a hobby or a passion, but rather a fundamental aspect of my identity. I may not know what the future holds, but I do know that dance will always be a part of it. In conclusion, my journey to become a dancer has been a defining experience in my life. It has taught me valuable lessons about hard work, perseverance, and patience. It has given me a sense of purpose and identity, and has been a source of comfort in the chaotic world that surrounds me. I know that pursuing dance as a career will not be easy, but I am ready to face the challenge head-on. Because to me, dance is not just a job, it's my calling.",0,2.326267617,2.542892288,2.644162881,2.868640144,2.568671711,12.0,13.2,17.0,21.4,15.0

As I look toward my future, I know that dance will continue to shape who I am and who I aspire to be. My journey in dance started in high school with a hip hop class at my local studio. I was hesitant to try something new, as it was outside of my comfort zone. But as soon as I stepped into the studio, the energy and the music ignited a new passion within me. It was as if I had found a missing piece of myself that I didn’t know was missing. Through dance, I have found a community of people who share my passion and drive to be better. In dance, we work together to achieve a common goal- a perfect performance.

C2,360,"The beat drops, and the energy in the room erupts. The bass reverberates through my body, and I move to the rhythm, feeling each beat in my bones. Hesitant to try something new and step outside of my comfort zone, I was wary of joining a dance class in high school. However, the moment I stepped into the studio, I was immediately captivated by the atmosphere. The studio was a place where everyone was welcome and united by their love for dance. It was as if I had found a missing piece of myself that I didn't know was missing. Dance requires more than just talent; it requires dedication, discipline, and passion. The process isn't easy- The countless hours of practice and the sore muscles are all part of the journey. But as I improved and saw the progress I made, it was all worth it. The community aspect of dance was a significant factor, which kept me motivated. I have been blessed to have many supportive partners and collaborators in my dance journey, who have pushed me to my limits and beyond. True growth comes from pushing oneself beyond their limits and striving to be better. I have learned the importance of pushing myself beyond my capabilities, and I have seen the results. An example of this was during a dance recital, where I had to perfect a complicated routine that required multiple lifts. One of the lifts was particularly challenging, and I struggled to master it, but with discipline and perseverance, I kept working on it. Finally, on the night of the recital, we executed it flawlessly, and there was an overwhelming sense of satisfaction and pride. That experience taught me that if you put your heart and soul into something, you will achieve your goals. Dance has also taught me vital life lessons. It has given me a new-found confidence in myself and my creative abilities. The stage is my canvas, and I can express my creativity through movement. It has helped me understand the importance of self-expression and how it can be used for storytelling. I have learned that when words fail me, movement is my voice. Through dance, I have been able to express emotions that would have taken me years to put into words. An example of this was when I performed a contemporary number that told a story of love and heartbreak. I wanted to portray the struggles of a toxic relationship, and the dance came to life as I performed it. The audience felt every movement, and it was evident that dance was a powerful storytelling tool. The multitudes of lessons that dance has taught me are endless. As I look to my future, I am excited to continue exploring and honing my skills as a dancer. My aspirations include attending college and majoring in dance, where I hope to gain a more in-depth understanding and knowledge of the art form. My dream is to become a professional dancer, choreographer, and teacher. I aspire to share my passion and love for dance with others, and help them discover their strengths and potential through movement. Dance has given me a purpose and identity. I am amazed at how an art form can shape who I am and who I aspire to be. The community of people who understand and share the same passion as me is an incredible feeling. Through dance, I have found my people, and I am proud to call them my family. The lessons that dance has taught me have been life-changing, and I am forever grateful. The journey has been inspirational, and the memories and experiences that I have gained will stay with me for life. In conclusion, dance is more than just a hobby or a form of exercise; it is a way of life. It is an art form that allows self-expression, discipline, and unity. Each beat of the music, each step, requires passion and dedication. The sense of pride and satisfaction that comes with a successful performance is unmatched.

H,361,"Winter is coming. And as the chilly season approaches, my high school will soon be invaded by smoothing…abominable. Lovesick teenagers armed with cheesy posters and grocery store flowers. Because at my school, winter is the harbinger of the Winter Formal Dance. But as girls secretly gossip as to who they wish to ask them and guys muster up the courage to do so, I spend another year resigning myself to not going. Whenever someone finds out that I’m skipping it, they never assume that it’s because I can’t afford to. Which is why I am always asked this same question: “Why not? What are you too poor? Hahaha!” The only way I can respond is to laugh it off and to make up an excuse. At times like these, however, living in a homogenously wealthy community can get disheartening because of how indelicate the kids here can be. But they aren’t simply mean for the sake of being petty, they just don’t realize how tactless they are being. Especially since the few less fortunate members of my community hide their situation for fear of being labelled as different. And though hiding the fact that we are poor may seem to work, we’re really just avoiding the problem. The problem being that we shouldn’t be made to feel ashamed of being poor. And the only way to fix this problem is to better inform our community about our struggles. If we want change, it has to start with us. We have to stop hiding the fact that we are poor because it isn’t something to be ashamed of. And by learning our stories and our situations, my community will strive for better understanding and work to be more considerate towards those less fortunate than they are. How do I know this? Because it’s already begun. There has been effort by the less fortunate members of my community to share their stories in person and on social media. I was inspired by this movement and confessed to my own friends about why I never got to the dance. And through this process, I found out how wonderful my community is. Because my friends are all so well-off, they’ve never seen money to be important. Something that I myself am guilty of. Since I never had enough, I’d always viewed money as something sacred. Which is why I never learned to be generous. But my friends, after I told them my reason, offered my $60 each so that I could go. As one of my friends put it: “I’d rather spend money on letting you have a good time rather than spending it on myself.” Despite my intention to teach my community, it was I who was humbled. I had never realized how stingy I had been until I was shown generosity. I hope to never again be as unaware as I had thought my community to be. I must be better, because I too am part of my community.",1,2.057371917,2.404245238,2.546257498,2.997338381,2.528663143,10.0,13.4,17.6,20.0,14.5
C0,362,"Growing up in an affluent town, I was surrounded by signs of wealth: pristine lawns, luxurious cars, and designer clothing. It wasn't until I got older that I began to notice the poverty that existed just beneath the surface of my seemingly perfect community. The first time I realized the severity of poverty in my town was in middle school. My school offered free lunch to students who qualified, and I noticed that many of my classmates would take advantage of this. At first, I assumed that their families just didn't want to spend money on school lunches, but then I started noticing that some of these same students were wearing the same clothes every day and living in run-down apartments. It wasn't just my classmates who were struggling - I started to see homeless people on the streets, and learned that many families in my town were living below the poverty line. It was a harsh reality to face, especially in a community that seemed so picture-perfect on the surface. Growing up in this environment has taught me a lot about the complexities of poverty. It's not just about not having enough money - it's about the emotional toll that poverty takes on families and individuals. Poverty leads to a lack of access to resources, and this lack of access can limit a person's potential in life. It's easy to overlook poverty in a wealthy community - after all, those who are struggling are far outnumbered by those who are not. But poverty exists, and it's important to recognize it and work to alleviate it. One of the biggest obstacles to fighting poverty in my community is stigma. Wealthy people often assume that those who are living in poverty are lazy or don't want to work. But this is simply not true. The reality is that poverty is a complex issue, and the circumstances that lead to it are often beyond an individual's control. For example, in my town, many people struggle to afford housing due to the high cost of living. In order to continue living in town, some families may have to choose between housing and basic necessities like food and healthcare. This isn't a choice anyone should have to make, and it's not reflective of a person's work ethic or motivation. Another factor that contributes to poverty in my community is education. While the schools in my town are generally excellent, there are still disparities in access to education. Students who come from wealthier families have access to resources that those who are struggling financially do not. For example, they might have access to tutors, extracurricular activities, and better technology. These disparities can have a huge impact on a student's future. Without access to resources, they may not be able to succeed at the same level as their wealthier peers. This can lead to a lack of opportunities and a perpetuation of the cycle of poverty. So what can we do to fight poverty in a wealthy community? First and foremost, it's important to recognize that poverty exists and that it's not the fault of those who are struggling. Instead of judging or stigmatizing those who are living in poverty, we should be working to support them and give them the resources they need to succeed. This could mean advocating for affordable housing, increasing access to education, or supporting local organizations that are working to alleviate poverty. It could even be something as simple as volunteering at a local food bank or donating clothes to a homeless shelter. One of the most effective ways to fight poverty is to be an ally to those who are struggling. This means listening to their experiences and supporting their goals. It means recognizing that their struggles are not unique to them, but are part of a larger societal issue that we all need to work to address. Being aware of poverty in my community has changed my perspective on wealth and privilege. I now recognize that not everyone has access to the same resources and opportunities that I do, and that it's important to use my privilege to advocate for those who are less fortunate. In many ways, poverty in a wealthy community is a contradiction - it's unexpected and often overlooked. But it exists, and it's up to all of us to fight it. It's time to break down the stigmas surrounding poverty and work towards a more equitable society where everyone has access to the resources they need to succeed.",0,2.595885317,2.777809341,2.862873672,3.062837627,2.821013658,13.6,18.0,20.8,22.8,19.0
C1,363,"Growing up in a privileged community, I was endlessly exposed to luxurious cars, designer clothes, and perfect lawns. However, beneath the perfect veneer of my elite community, a harsh reality lurked. Poverty was omnipresent, yet mostly ignored or overlooked. It wasn't until I reached middle school that I first began noticing the severity of poverty all around me. In middle school, I noticed that many of my classmates took advantage of the free lunch program offered by the school. At first, I thought it was simple reluctance to spend money on school lunches, but then I realized that some of those kids were wearing the same clothes every single day, and their apartments were rundown. Not only were my fellow students struggling to make ends meet, but I noticed that many adults on the street were homeless, and inquiring further exposed that many families in the neighborhood were living below the poverty line. It was a harsh realization to face, particularly while living in a picture-perfect community. Growing up in this environment, I learned a lot about the complexities of poverty. Money is, by no means, the only factor involved in poverty; the emotional and psychological effects of poverty are often even more significant. The dearth of resources accessible to those living in poverty stunts their potential in life. Poverty is an obstacle that is often ignored in affluent communities. The wealthy simply don't recognize or realize how prevalent it is within their own communities. Frequently, they assume that those struggling with poverty are lazy, or lack motivation or drive. This couldn't be further from the truth - poverty is a complex issue, and the factors that can contribute to poverty are often beyond the control of the individual. For example, in my affluent neighborhood, the high cost of living places tremendous strain on the ability of many families to afford housing. As such, many families are forced to choose between housing and basics, like food or healthcare - an impossible choice nobody should have to make. This choice isn't made as a result of laziness or motivation, it's merely a reflection of the systemic flaws within society. Education is another factor that often contributes to poverty. Although the schools in my community are of the utmost quality, there are discrepancies in education access. Children from wealthy families have access to resources that many struggling students do not. For example, wealthy families might frequently hire tutors, or provide additional opportunities like extracurricular activities or access to high-end technology. These discrepancies could have a considerable impact on a student's future. Without resources, they could easily fail to achieve the same level of success as the wealthy. This perpetuates the poverty cycle and leads them to a path full of obstacles. What can be done to combat poverty in an affluent community? First and foremost, poverty acceptance is crucial. Instead of stigmatizing and judging those facing severe financial difficulties, we should be working to support them and offer them access to the resources they need to achieve success. This could be accomplished by advocating for affordable housing, providing access to education, or even by contributing to organizations that work towards alleviating poverty. Simple gestures, like volunteering at local food banks or donating clothing to homeless shelters, could also go a long way! Being an ally to the disadvantaged can make a substantial difference. This entails supporting and listening to their experiences, as well as encouraging their goals. Poverty is a societal issue that requires our immediate attention. Acknowledging poverty amidst wealth and privilege has altered my perspective regarding the advantages that I enjoy. I now realize that not everyone has access to the same resources and opportunities that I do. And it's a must to use my access and privilege for the betterment of those who aren't as fortunate. Poverty in an affluent community represents a contradiction, one that is frequently overlooked. However, it is a reality that needs to be addressed. Poverty stigmatization needs to be broken down, and equity framework needs to be established where every individual has access to resources to achieve success.",0,2.513842469,2.671097211,2.866085933,3.181887427,2.801241194,11.0,14.2,17.8,23.0,16.0
C2,364,"From the moment I walked into the Winter Formal Dance, I felt like an outsider. My family's financial struggles meant I couldn't afford the expensive dresses and suits that everyone else wore, and I didn't have the latest accessories or jewelry. It was just another day in the life of a low-income student, feeling like an outcast in a world that didn't understand. The bright colors of the decorations, the loud chatter of students, and the thumping bass of the music created an almost surreal atmosphere – one that only heightened my sense of being out of place. I tried my best to blend in, but the looks from fellow students made me feel all the more self-conscious. My struggles with poverty in school were not limited to events like these dances. It was a daily battle – from not having enough money to buy the latest textbooks and supplies, to worrying about whether I would be able to afford lunch. The constant struggle was mentally and emotionally taxing, and I often felt like giving up. But through it all, I learned resilience. Despite not having the same privileges as my peers, I refused to let my financial struggles define me. Instead, I found solace in educational resources like the library and the internet, where I could access free tutorials and educational videos to supplement my classroom learning. It wasn't easy, but I refused to let my circumstances hold me back. It was a lesson that not only helped me succeed academically but also in life. Instead of letting the challenges of poverty in school defeat me, I learned to be resourceful, creative, and self-reliant. I used my experiences to help connect with others in similar situations, sharing tips and strategies for survival. Above all, I realized the importance of creating a culture of understanding and empathy. Far too often, low-income students face stigma and discrimination, and the impact of poverty in school can leave lasting scars. We need to create a safe and supportive space for all students to share their experiences, so that no one feels alone in their struggles. One way to create this kind of community is by sharing stories that highlight the importance of support and understanding. For example, when I was in middle school, a local organization donated new backpacks filled with supplies like pencils, binders, and notebooks to low-income students like me. It was a small act of kindness that made a world of difference, and I will always be grateful for that support. Financial support is important, but it's not enough. We need to go beyond that and create a culture of inclusivity that values diversity and shows compassion towards those who may be experiencing poverty in school. It starts with our teachers along with our peers. By opening up a dialogue and having an honest conversation about the challenges of poverty, we can begin to break down the barriers that divide us. We can also make a difference by supporting organizations that provide resources for low-income students. From academic tutoring centers, to college prep programs, to scholarships and grants, there are plenty of opportunities out there for those who are willing to seek them out. We cannot let poverty in school define us. It's easy to get caught up in feelings of depression or hopelessness, but we must stay strong and remember our worth. No matter what our economic background may be, we are capable of achieving greatness. We can overcome the obstacles, with the help of a supportive community. In conclusion, poverty in school is a challenging experience, one that can leave lasting scars. But it's also a journey that can help us find resilience, creativity, and self-reliance. By creating a culture of empathy and understanding, we can start to break down the barriers that divide us and build a community that values diversity and shows compassion towards those who may be experiencing poverty in school. With the right support, we can all reach our full potential, no matter what our economic background may be.

H,365,"I was immensely disappointed when I didn’t hear my name as the winners were being announced. A few seconds before, I was so excited that it might have seemed as if I was waiting to win the Nobel Prize, instead of an award for my project in mathematics at the Scientific and Research Council of Turkey National Projects Competition. Throughout the 4 days of the Project Fair, I presented my project to over 100 visitors. I was even offered a mentorship by an accomplished mathematics professor, who also visited the fair and seemed very interested in my project, in which I had developed two alternative approaches to methods for expressing power sums in a formula, a complex topic in mathematics previously worked on but that could not be simplified. I was confident, because everyone, including the other contestants, thought that my project would win. Overconfidence, as it turns out, can sometimes lead to great disappointments. I was not sure why I actually wanted to win this contest: to be giving the honor of winning the contest or to have my mathematical findings recognized nationally? When they were announcing the winners, I realized that having my work appreciated was what mattered the most. Some of the projects that Turkish scientific institutions overlooked went on to later win recognition internationally; so my project might not have actually been insufficient, but it just did not win. The fact that this competition was the only place in Turkey where I could truly demonstrate my competence and skills in mathematics on such a stage was the reason why I so badly wanted to excel at it. However, failing to get my project recognized showed me that there will be times in life when I will lose, just like there will be times when I win. Fortunately, I was raised in a family where I was taught that I should not be discouraged by failure; rather I should learn lessons and build myself up through them. Further, my failure made me more sensitive to the current conditions in Turkey, in terms of the political difficulties, threats of terror and unrest, and constraints on scientific development. The current atmosphere in the country is in many ways quite opposite from the view of the world that I have learned as an IB student. So how can I, as an international-mind and creative thinker, reach my true potential in an environment that is in many unsuitable at present, and how can I be useful in the future to help us overcome the challenges we currently face? Answer: by carrying out my studies in a place where science and development are put above all else. This would allow me to pursue my passions without the current limitations of the Turkish system, in which I must, for example, choose between biology and mathematics, instead of being able to study both, which study abroad will allow me to do. Something one hears less every day in Turkey is “I want to make a difference,” due to those constant distractions that people here have to deal with daily, and which make it much more difficult to focus on progressing. I do, however, want to make a difference as a woman and an aspiring scientist, two parts of my identity that unfortunately are not allowed their full expression in my country. Because I love my community and the many remarkable people in it, and because I have gained so much from them, I want to give back by contributing to science, being a force for positive change in my homeland, and inspiring Turkish women to take part in the scientific world. Long story short, I interpreted the outcome of this competition as a failure before, but I have come to realize more each day that the broader perspective in this incident inspired in me has put me on the road to success.",1,2.909088722,3.126217408,3.541122163,3.722263572,3.401463746,18.0,29.0,31.0,42.0,30.0
C0,366,"As I stared blankly at my computer screen, the weight of defeat weighed heavily upon me. I had just received my first rejection letter from the college of my dreams: Yale University. A wave of disappointment and self-doubt enveloped me, and I questioned whether I was even worthy of attending such a prestigious institution. However, it was through this failure that I learned the most valuable lesson of my life: that my worth is not defined by my successes, but rather by my resilience in the face of failure. Growing up, I had always been an overachiever. I excelled in academics, sports, and extracurricular activities, and I never missed an opportunity to pursue something new with unwavering determination. This insatiable hunger for success was instilled in me since childhood, as I constantly strove to meet the expectations of my parents, teachers, and peers. Consequently, the idea of failure was foreign to me; it was something that happened to other people, to those who were not as skilled, diligent, or deserving as I was. So, when I received my rejection letter from Yale, I was blindsided. I thought I had everything figured out, but in reality, I was merely living in an illusion of perfection. It took me weeks to come to terms with my rejection, and during that time, I went through a range of emotions - anger, sadness, and self-pity. But it was through these emotions that I realized that I had lost sight of the true value of resilience. Resilience is the ability to bounce back from setbacks and challenges, to stay motivated and positive in spite of failure. It does not hinge on one's successes or failures alone, but rather on one's ability to persevere through adversity. Through my reflection, I realized that resilience was a trait that I had always overlooked in my own life. I was so fixated on achieving success that I failed to appreciate the journey that comes with it. Success is not just about reaching the finish line but also about the hurdles that one encounters along the way. It is these hurdles that build character, bring about growth, and prepare us for the future. And it was through my failure that I began to appreciate the importance of resilience in life. Moreover, my rejection from Yale taught me the value of humility. Humility is the act of acknowledging one's limitations and accepting that one doesn't always know the answers. As an overachiever, accepting that I was not enough for Yale was a difficult pill to swallow. It was a humbling experience, one that forced me to confront the idea that I wasn't invincible. But, in doing so, I began to see that there was immense power in being humble. When we accept our limitations, we open ourselves up to new opportunities, we learn from our mistakes, and we develop a deeper sense of empathy for those around us. Through humility, I began to rediscover the joy in learning, not just for grades, but also for the sheer pleasure of expanding my knowledge and perspectives. Most importantly, my failure taught me that even in the midst of uncertainty, there are always new opportunities to be found. My rejection from Yale might have felt like the end of the road, but it was only the beginning of a new journey. It forced me to confront my passions and goals, to seek out other institutions and programs that aligned with my interests. In the process, I have discovered new interests, new friends, and new paths that I never would have explored had I simply stuck to my original plan. In conclusion, my failure is not a story of defeat, but rather a narrative of growth and resilience. It taught me that failures are not endpoints but rather opportunities for growth, that resilience is not defined by successes alone but by one's ability to bounce back from setbacks, and that humility is an essential ingredient for success. It was through my rejection from Yale that I learned to appreciate these lessons, and for that, I am forever grateful.",0,2.681913635,2.803224539,2.967189479,3.210379457,2.890200869,16.4,18.8,21.0,25.6,20.0

Like a proud parent, I had nurtured my project for months, perfecting every detail, confident that it would stand out among other participants.

At that moment, my bubble burst. All my confidence, which had been built on the expectation of winning, was shattered. The experience taught me that validation from society isn't the only measure of success – it's the passion and love for the subject that counts. The competition had helped me realize that my passion for mathematics was more significant than the trophy I had hoped to take home. Moreover, the failure of not being recognized at the competition ignited in me the desire to leave Turkey and find a place where I could explore my passion for mathematics more without constraint. The Turkish system constrained us, forcing us to choose between biology or mathematics instead of enabling us to pursue both subjects. As a woman and aspiring scientist, my identity wasn't allowed full expression in my country. My failure helped me discover my purpose of extending my studies abroad in a place where scientific development is put above everything else. Through this, I believe I can give back to my local community, India, and contribute to the betterment of society. Volunteering and community service was a mandatory requirement for students in Turkey, but I didn't see its value until I began volunteering at an orphanage. In the little children's eyes, I saw a drive to be alive and vibrant, even though their lives had been shattered by parental separation or loss. They had tasted the deep sorrow of emotional loss, but they were learning to pursue life with enthusiasm. From them, I learned resilience, perseverance, and an undefeated hope for the future. Volunteering also invited challenges, such as working with difficult children or personality conflicts between team members. However, in every instance, I was learning valuable lessons that I carry with me to this day. Unconditional dedication and passion enabled me to rise above the limitations of language barriers and different ideologies. Thus, through community service, I also became more empathetic, compassionate, and creative. Just like with mathematics, community service taught me that achieving an outcome isn't the only measure of success. It's how you grow and what you learn that's vital. It's about finding purpose, growth, and fulfillment in everything that you do. As I embark on the next phase of my life, pursuing a higher education degree overseas, I will hold my experiences in competitive mathematics and community service close to my heart. I will continue to pursue my passion for mathematics, and through it, help contribute to society in a meaningful way. I'll carry my experiences forward with resilience, perseverance, and unwavering hope, continuing to grow and inspire others to do the same. Failure will be a stepping stone for me to achieve greater milestones, and the journey will always be the rewarding part.",0,2.594871038,2.890741286,3.100468738,3.198929485,2.997983207,13.4,17.8,21.0,24.2,20.0
C2,368,"The bright lights of the competition venue shone in my eyes, blurring the faces of the other participants as I made my way to my seat. Sweat beaded on my forehead despite the air conditioning, making me wonder if it was hot in there or if it was all in my head. The anticipation was palpable, and the tension snaked through the room like a live current. I held my breath as they announced the winners, my heart racing with excitement and anticipation. When my name wasn't called, I felt like I was drowning. The sound of my heartbeats thudded like a drum, drowning out the soft murmurs of the audience. From the fierce determination in my eyes, no one would have guessed that I was struggling to keep my tears from falling. Disappointment and frustration were etched in every line of my face. I wanted to scream out in despair, a primal howl of frustration and agony bubbling up from within me. My failure at the competition was a turning point in my life, a bitter lesson that taught me the importance of passion and purpose. The desire to pursue mathematics was stronger than ever, and I vowed to indulge it without constraints, free to explore its mysteries. Leaving Turkey was the only way to achieve this goal, to free myself from the limitations and confinements of my country. The systems and conventions restrict our ability to grow, to express ourselves fully. Pursuing my studies abroad would give me the chance to become the person I was meant to be. Community service was another life-changing experience, one that taught me the importance of empathy and compassion. Volunteering at the orphanage opened my eyes to the resilience of young children. Despite their loss and pain, they persevered, bright-eyed with hope, eager to learn and grow. My heart opened to them, and I felt inspired by their quiet courage, their unwavering commitment to life. Working with the children wasn't easy, and I had to overcome many challenges. Some of the kids were difficult to handle, their energy and emotions volatile and unpredictable. But through it all, I learned to be more patient, more empathetic, and creative. The experience taught me the value of unconditional dedication, the ability to rise above differences and limitations, and the power of a giving and loving heart. For me, success isn't just achieving an outcome, getting the trophy or the recognition. It's about finding purpose, growth, and fulfillment in everything you do. It's about pursuing your passions, without limitations, and contributing to society in a meaningful way. It's about growing and inspiring others to do the same. As I prepare to pursue my higher education overseas, I know that my experiences of community service and competitive mathematics will guide me. My love for mathematics will be my compass, leading me where no one else has gone before, free from constraints and limitations. I will persevere, even in the face of failure, always remembering to find purpose, growth, and fulfillment in the journey. Life is a journey, and I am proud of every step I have taken. The lessons I have learned through my experiences have been invaluable to me, shaping me into the woman I am today. As I look towards the future, I feel a sense of excitement and anticipation for all the possibilities that lie ahead. My failure has become my greatest strength, and I will continue to pursue my passions with resilience, determination, and unwavering hope.",0,2.522139047,2.729060149,2.893267474,3.110900842,2.825117971,13.4,15.0,19.2,22.0,17.0
H,369,"Growing up with a stutter was difficult. My thoughts were always fully formed, but the words would get stuck. The harder I tried to force them out, the more they would jam up, like train cars going off a track. Sometimes kids would laugh or make fun of my stutter, but mostly they just ignored me. They had better things to do than wait to hear my ideas, so they assumed I had none worth hearing. Eventually, I gave up talking to people entirely. They thought I was stupid, and, soon enough, I thought so too. My parents signed me up to play soccer in the hopes that being part of a team would help me make friends. I wasn’t particularly athletic, and I could barely kick a ball. But soccer is a game anyone can play. On the field, my stutter didn’t matter. I discovered that I could lead, quietly, through action, rather than words. Eventually, speech therapy resolved by stutter, but it was on the soccer field that I learned how to be me. One of my teammates had a brother with Down Syndrome. Every season, he came to our games to watch from the sidelines. He had cleats and a ball that he kicked around by himself, but because he also had an intellectual disability, there was no room for him on our team or anywhere else. I realized that although soccer is a sport for everyone, not everyone is included in the sport. I understood the pain of being excluded simply because of an inability to communicate. So, in February of 2015, I launched GOALS (Giving Opportunities to All who Love Soccer), a unified soccer program for kids with and without special needs. GOALS partners youth athletes who have intellectual disabilities with neurotypical peer buddies. The athletes and buddies play together, as unified pairs, in small-sided, non-competitive scrimmages. The first GOALS program had just nine participants. Today, we hold GOALS events twice a month for fifty players of all abilities. GOALS has impacted over 400 kids and is now an official partner of Special Olympics Arizona. But I don’t measure the success of GOALS by the numbers. Success comes in the form of an athlete like Josh*, who came reluctantly to his first GOALS event, having never tried sports before, preferring instead to play video games by himself. Josh was surprised to find that he loves soccer, and he looks forward to playing with his friends at every GOALS event, where his diagnosis of autism doesn’t define him. What makes GOALS special is that it is not a community service program for kids with intellectual disabilities. GOALS is a program that serves the entire community, understanding that our community includes people of all abilities. GOALS champions people for what they bring to the community, rather than defining them by what they take. GOALS breaks down the barriers that separate kids with special needs from their neurotypical peers, creating intentional connections that allow true friendships to develop. For many kids, GOALS is the first time they experience genuine acceptance. Through sports, we have the capacity to create something better than tolerance. Tolerance is for summer heat, visits to the doctor’s office, and lines at the bank. People, though, deserve more than tolerance. People deserve acceptance. So often, kids with intellectual disabilities are isolated socially, for no other reason than that kids pass them by. But special needs kids can be incredibly smart and talented. We just need to slow down long enough to get to know them. Some need more time to turn their ideas into words, but we can afford to have those slower conversations. That is why, for me, unified sports will be a lifelong passion. Through sports, anyone can communicate that each of us is valued, each of us is a part of the time, and each of us is a friend worth having.",1,2.412318856,2.497173829,2.678723005,2.965217328,2.630772037,10.2,12.0,16.0,20.0,13.5
C0,370,"Inclusion is a fundamental aspect of a civilized society, yet it is often undermined in sports. One of the most prevalent factors that contribute to exclusion is physical and mental disabilities. People with disabilities are still facing barriers when it comes to embracing a physical lifestyle, particularly within sports. However, a Unified soccer program has been created by the Special Olympics, specifically designed to merge athletes with and without disabilities into the same team. I am convinced that this program has benefitted athletes by developing social and athletic skills, creating empathy, and enhancing inclusion as a whole. I still remember vividly an incident that took place when I was 10 years old. My little brother, who has cerebral palsy, came back from soccer practice crying. He was told he was not welcome on the team because of his disability. It was undoubtedly one of the most heart-wrenching moments of my life. At the time, my brother did not have access to a unified sports program, and this was not an isolated event. An alarming number of children with disabilities continue to be excluded from team sports. However, when I discovered the Unified soccer program, I felt that things have started to change positively, especially when I saw the joy in my brother's face when he had the same opportunities as his peers did during a unified soccer game. This program seemingly aims to bring athletes together and promote an inclusive environment that celebrates differences rather than accentuating them. The precious thing about the Unified soccer program is that it includes people of different abilities, opening the gates for the disabled to engage in athletics leisure. For teenagers with disabilities, their physical fitness, and social skills are often neglected, as the activities they typically participate in are more in the center of their therapy. The unified soccer program integrates sports into their lives as a daily routine and provides a more holistic approach to rehabilitation. As someone who loves soccer, I believe that understanding the sport can also be a way of understanding unity, teamwork, and compassion---skills that transfer across all boundaries. In addition to benefitting individuals with disabilities, the Unified soccer program has created significant opportunities for social development. This program breaks down preconceived notions that people with disabilities are different or not as functional as their non-disabled peers. By linking up individuals of different backgrounds, the program encourages positive attitudes and creates an environment where stereotypes are rejected in favor of inclusion. The Unified soccer program has also become the gateway to empathy and friendship. A total of 22% of students have reported giving up an opportunity to interact with a student with disabilities. However, such instances are seen even less frequently within the unified soccer program as compared to any sport or club in high school. The interdependent nature of soccer demands that players communicate and encourage each other to forge success. The inclusive environment where each student is a valued team member builds relationships in the program that have proved to last a lifetime. Apart from personal development and inclusive initiatives, the Unified soccer program conveys an important message of empathy and civic services. It not only creates athletes with superior sportsmanship but also affirms the abundance of kindness and devotion to others. Being part of the Unified soccer team means learning to become contributing members of the community, building leadership qualities, and acquiring a firm moral code. As a high school senior, I can undoubtedly say that I have learned more through communicating with disabled friends than with lessons learned in the classroom. I share that the Unified soccer team is a unique organ for learning outside the class—a place that allows us to interact with people of different beliefs and backgrounds. It is by coming together for a common goal that one can recognize their talents, strengths, and the inalienable value of learning from one another. As the world pushes for more inclusive policies, and as our society gains a deeper understanding of various disabilities, it is imperative that opportunities for inclusion expand. The Unified soccer program has changed the legacy of good sportsmanship, created an enhanced camaraderie and empathy, and set an example for teamwork and community service. It has redefined inclusion by recognizing the valuable contributions of every team member, with or without a disability. In conclusion, as a future student of Yale, I envisage opportunities to become more involved with this program. There may be opportunities to volunteer, donate, or actively participate in the Unified soccer program, all to further its mission of promoting inclusion and empathy. With the lessons learned from this program, I am confident that I can create a legacy of inclusion, extending to all areas of college, and to the world beyond.",0,2.994240428,3.122414003,3.343126939,3.448624053,3.193495555,16.0,19.4,23.0,26.0,21.0
C1,371,"Growing up, I witnessed firsthand the importance of inclusion and the negative repercussions of not having it in place. My little brother was told he could not join a soccer team because of his disability, and it was heart-wrenching to see him come back crying. It is a harsh reality that children with disabilities are frequently excluded from team sports and the benefits that come with them. Therefore, I have a personal passion for advocating for inclusive sports programs like Unified soccer, which creates a level playing field for all athletes. Unified soccer programs offer a valuable avenue for people with and without disabilities to engage in sports together. It promotes inclusivity by merging athletes of different abilities on the same team, fostering a culture that values diversity and celebrates differences. This sports program helps promote social and athletic skills and encourages empathy, which are essential virtues that translate across all boundaries. The practical benefits of Unified soccer are immense, especially for teenagers with disabilities. Their physical fitness and social skills are often neglected because the standard activities they participate in primarily focus on therapeutic interventions. This sports program provides an opportunity to integrate sports into their lives as a daily routine, combining a more holistic approach to rehabilitation. Moreover, the Unified soccer program promotes social development inclusive of everyone, breaking down preconceived notions that people with disabilities are different or not as functional as their non-disabled peers. By linking up individuals of different backgrounds, the program encourages positive attitudes and creates an environment where stereotypes are rejected in favor of inclusion. Another essential element of the Unified soccer program is the empathy and friendship it engenders. The program provides a platform where individuals of different abilities work together towards a common goal. In this inclusive environment, each student is valued as a team member, building relationships that prove to last a lifetime. The empathy and ability to foster long-lasting friendships are vital because they create unity amongst the team members and promote a positive outlook on differences. With the Unified soccer program, there is also an opportunity to learn outside the class. Students get a chance to interact with people of different beliefs and backgrounds, which enhances their overall cognitive development. They have a chance to develop an open-minded perspective and learn first-hand about various disabilities and cultures. It provides students with a glimpse of the diverse world we live in. The Unified soccer program is an incremental change to promote inclusive policies across various sectors. As the world gains a deeper understanding of various disabilities, it is imperative that opportunities for inclusion expand. This program has proven to be a valuable avenue towards that end. It has been seen to redefine inclusion by recognizing the valuable contributions of every team member, irrespective of their abilities. In summary, Inclusion is critical in creating a civilized society, and the Unified soccer program is a valuable contribution to that cause. I am enthusiastic about advocating for this program and being part of efforts geared towards promoting inclusivity. As a future student at Harvard, I believe there are many opportunities to become involved with this program, such as volunteering, donating, or actively participating in the Unified soccer program. With the skills and values learned from this initiative, I am committed to creating an ethos of inclusion that extends to all areas of college and beyond.

C2,372,"As a young child, I had always been fascinated by the art of painting. I loved how the brushstrokes painted unique stories on the canvas, leaving an organic yet awe-inspiring feel. Every stroke was a story, a feeling, and an experience. As I grew older, my fascination with painting grew into a passion. Painting became my escape from the world, a perfect way to lose myself in the beauty of colors and their magic. Every time I dipped the brush into the paint, I felt as if I was taking a step into a world beyond the physical realm. And each time the brush touched the canvas, it was like a part of me coming to life. One particular day, I walked into my studio to begin painting, and I just couldn't get my inspiration to flow. I was struggling to find something to paint, so I decided to take a walk to clear my head. As I walked around the neighborhood, I stumbled upon an old vintage market. The market was bustling with vibrant energy, and the much distinct artistic culture was evident through the array of goods on the display. The visual spectacle sparked something in me, and that's when inspiration hit me. That day, I channeled my inspiration into my painting, creating a masterpiece that even I couldn't explain how it turned out so well. It was as though the twists and turns of the market infused themselves into my painting, creating an emotional depth beyond what I had imagined. From that day on, I realized that sometimes, inspiration is not only found in our imagination or within ourselves, but also in the things we experience in life. It was a realization that has helped shape my perspective about art and life in general. I learned that like in painting, life is full of twists and turns, highs and lows, and that we must be open to embracing every experience we encounter because they all influence our journey in one way or another. Learning to appreciate these twists and turns has brought me peace, and contentment as I paint. This realization has also created a new passion for me, one that is steered towards creating art that exposes the unique cultures that make up our world. Across all cultural lines, there is always something about the uniqueness of every community that resonates within me, and it has seeped into my painting, further fueling my passion for the arts. As I prepare to attend Yale, I am excited about continuing my journey as a painter, exploring new cultures and emotions, and expressing those feelings mold into painting. Yale provides an incredible opportunity to connect me with like-minded individuals and faculty who I can share my passion for the arts with. With my passion for painting, I hope to become a voice of cultural transformation in my art world, holding conversations that promote openness and inclusivity, while also expressing the beauty and uniqueness of every culture— proffering fresh perspectives that drive change in our world. In conclusion, painting has become an integral part of my existence, shaping my perspectives, and fostering a deep appreciation for the beauty in the world. I pray that as I journey towards Yale, my painting takes me to regions unknown while helping to create a better world.",0,2.71202939,2.945687443,3.030303547,3.415250105,2.983997247,15.6,19.6,23.0,27.2,22.0
H,373,"Ocean waves of panic perspired in my palms and a 6.3 magnitude earthquake trembled in my hands. I was afraid but spoke deliberately; fear would not stop me from sharing my first vulnerable poem: …I want my insides—dry, dead wood—to be lit with a match, and no water could ever put me out, no hurricane of sadness, no gentle rainstorm of doubt could stop the heat inside… When finished, I looked up to see unblinking eyes and tears running down my teacher’s face. In that moment, I became a writer. I recited the poem near the end of my creative writing class my sophomore year. Throughout the class, students focused on one genre, and choosing to stay on the safe path, I focused on fiction, which I had written since I could hold a pencil. Although I admired poetry and the way a poet in a few lines could convey the feelings expressed in 300 pages of a novel, it intimidated me. I feared I did not have the skill to craft with such imagery, detail, and purpose. When a poet in my class shared her work, I was taken aback by her striking metaphors and cryptic imagery. But what shocked me most was that she got her message across. Suddenly, I had an epiphany: writing didn’t have to follow all the rules. A writer could take a feeling and express it through unique images. It’s not about the picture on the page, but what the picture makes the reader feel. With zeal and inspiration, I began to use literary devices and images with purpose. I aimed to convey emotion through images. Most of my writing before told the stories of fictional characters, but in my poem, I channeled all my confusion and stress. I poured my soul onto the page. When I read my poem out load, several changes occurred in me. I freed myself from the fear of taking risks. My poem gave me the courage to transfer to a new school, a decision which continued to build my confidence and creativity. Before, I had always written as a means of escape, as a way to create distractions by hiding in a world that was not my own. But in writing the poem, I confronted my problems and answered questions. Poetry taught me how to be brave, how to get right up to the edge of a cliff and embrace vulnerability and the fear of the fall. I also realized the impact my writing could have on others. Before, I did not enjoy sharing my writing because I created stories for my own amusement and pleasure. Now my eyes are open to the power of words. I do not view a story or poem as an individual experience, but as a unifying tie amongst people. Writing is about observing the world and using my life stories and emotions to help listeners and readers feel less lost and alone. The tears which fell down my teacher’s face and the wide eyes of my peers were not because they had the same experience as me, but because they paralleled the feeling I created with their own life stories. In revealing the deepest parts of myself, the class contemplated their own deeper thoughts. Now I write to examine; now I write to understand; now I write to comfort the chaos. Etching pieces of myself into the grooves and curves of each sentence. I do not expect others to connect with the story but rather connect with the emotion. I now know each story or poem is a heart, beating and alive, raw and utterly vulnerable, but also stretching out in a network of veins drawing readers back to the center, unifying one another.",1,2.320860435,2.551509352,2.769286273,3.056461647,2.62502718,12.0,14.0,17.2,24.8,16.0
C0,374,"As a child, I was always fearful of the dark. The shadows that crept across my bedroom walls at night inspired a deep sense of unease in my young mind, and I would often huddle beneath my blankets in the hope that they would shield me from whatever terrors lay beyond them. As I grew older, my fears became more complex and nuanced, as I grappled with the real-world anxieties of social pressure, academic stress, and the looming specter of impending adulthood. It wasn't until I stumbled upon the art of poetry that I found an effective means of conquering these fears. Writing poetry allowed me to channel my anxieties into something tangible, something that I could control and manipulate at my leisure. The act of putting pen to paper and shaping my thoughts into art became a form of therapy, allowing me to face my fears head-on and emerge from the experience not only unscathed, but empowered. When I wrote my first poem, I was struck by the physical rush of creative energy that coursed through my veins. The act of creating something new and beautiful from my own experiences and emotions was transformative, a kind of alchemy that turned my fears into raw material for artistic expression. In that moment, I realized that poetry was not just a means of entertainment or decoration, but a powerful tool for personal growth and self-discovery. At the heart of this realization was the recognition that poetry is fundamentally an act of courage. When we put our thoughts and feelings on the page, we expose ourselves to vulnerability and judgment. We risk being misunderstood or dismissed, and the act of sharing our innermost selves with others can feel daunting and overwhelming. But it is precisely this vulnerability that gives poetry its power, as it allows us to connect with others on a deep emotional level, and to build empathy and understanding in a world that is too often focused on surface appearances. Through writing poetry, I learned to face my fears head-on, using them as fuel for my creative fire rather than allowing them to consume me. When I found myself overwhelmed by the pressures of school or social life, I would retreat to my notebook and pour my heart out onto the page. The act of writing forced me to confront my fears, to articulate them in words, and to see them for what they truly were: temporary obstacles, rather than insurmountable barriers. One of the most powerful examples of this came when I was struggling with the transition to a new school, after moving across the country during my junior year. As much as I tried to put on a brave face and fit in with my new classmates, I was wracked with anxiety and self-doubt. It was only when I wrote a poem about my experiences that I found the strength to face my fears head-on, and to approach my new school with a sense of renewed confidence and purpose. Somehow, the act of putting my experiences into words gave them a sense of legitimacy and importance, and helped me recognize that I was not alone in my struggles. In many ways, writing poetry became a form of meditation for me, a way of quieting the noise of the world and tuning into my own inner voice. As I wrote and revised my poems, I found that my fears gradually lost their hold on me, and that I was able to face the challenges of life with greater resilience and courage. Looking back on my high school career, I am filled with gratitude for the transformative power of poetry, and for the lessons it taught me about facing my fears with courage and creativity. For me, the act of writing poetry was not just about creating art, but about using that art to confront my fears and challenges head-on. Whether I was struggling with academic stress or societal pressure, writing poetry gave me a way to channel my emotions in a positive and constructive way, and to emerge from each experience with a greater sense of self-awareness and purpose. As I prepare to embark on the next stage of my life, I am grateful for the lessons I learned through poetry, and for the strength and resilience it has given me as I continue to navigate the ever-changing landscape of the world.",0,3.052912393,3.16798452,3.426569882,3.604283199,3.20721521,21.0,25.0,30.0,35.0,28.5
C1,375,"The transformative power of writing is undeniable. The act of putting words on a page can be a source of comfort, self-discovery, and personal growth. I discovered this firsthand when I wrote my first poem in high school, which ignited a passion for poetry that helped me confront my fears and become a more confident and empowered person. Like many teenagers, I was plagued by fears and insecurities. I dreaded the prospect of growing up and becoming an adult, confronting the pressures of life, and the expectations of others. But when I sat down to write poetry, those fears melted away, replaced by a sense of calm and purpose as I poured my thoughts and emotions onto the page. At first, I was intimidated by the medium of poetry, with its intricate rules and cryptic symbolism. But as I discovered the beauty of language, I found that poetry was a form of vulnerability and connection that allowed me to share my deepest fears and struggles with the world. No longer did I fear the darkness, but approached it with a sense of curiosity and wonder, using writing to express what I couldn't say. Perhaps the most defining moment of my creative journey came in my sophomore year of high school. I was a student in a creative writing class where we focused on various genres, and I chose to focus on fiction to stay on the safe path. Poetry intimidated me, and I feared my lack of skill would show. However, during a class discussion, a peer read a striking poem with striking metaphors and imagery, and shared raw emotion that left me and the class in awe. In that moment, I realized that writing didn't have to follow the rules, and that there was no one way to express oneself. Writing is about conveying emotions through imagery and unique, purposeful language. So I decided to take a leap of faith and write a poem about my own experience. The act of baring my soul in public was terrifying, but also liberating. When I finished reciting my poem, I looked around and saw tears in my teacher's eyes and unblinking stares on my peer's faces. In that instant, I knew I had discovered my calling. I became a writer. From that moment on, poetry became a source of power for me, a tool to face my fears head-on, and to overcome the challenges before me. I used writing to explore my anxieties and emotional experiences, putting words to them as if materializing them into reality. The process of writing also allowed me to connect with others on a deep emotional level, reaching out and touching lives with my own experiences. One of such moments came to me when I was moving to a new school in my junior year. Amidst the transitions, the pressure to start anew was overwhelming. But instead of burying myself in my fears, I turned to poetry. I wrote about my doubts, insecurities, and hopes. By putting into words every feeling, I transformed the fear of the unknown into a sense of ownership and purposefulness. When recited to my family, they realized how hard it was for me to adjust and were supportive of my struggles. Writing poetry not only empowered me to face my fears, but it also taught me the language of empathy and compassion. I learned the power of words and how they could impact those around me, those struggling with their own fears and insecurities. Writing not only helped me, but it helped them as well. As I prepare to take on the next chapter of my life, I am grateful for the transformative power of poetry. It has taught me that vulnerability is not weakness, that the place of fear can be a source of power and creativity. It has given me a language to understand my own emotions and express them effectively, and allowed me to connect with others in a more profound and meaningful way. Writing has transformed me. It has helped me overcome fears and challenges, and to become a more confident and empowered person. I hope to continue using writing to explore the world around me, to share my insights and emotions with those around me, and to make a positive impact on the world.

C2,376,"The crisp sound of my pen scratching against the paper greeted me as I huddled beside my window, wrapped in a thick, woolen blanket. Outside, the world was a blur of gray, foggy mist that blanketed the forest beyond my yard, but it was the perfect setting for me to finally tackle the poem that had been brewing in my mind. As I wrote, the rhythm of my words lulling me into a trance, I felt the emotions that I had purposely avoided come spilling out. The fear, the anxiety, the excitement of the coming years—the good and the bad—were all captured with each line, each metaphor that I patiently crafted. Within the heart of my stanzas, I found refuge, for the world outside of my writing was unkind and unforgiving. It was then that a sudden opportunity challenged me to read my poems in class. I was deeply intimidated at first. I had always been a shy student who would rather disappear in the background of her peers. But I knew that this was a chance to share with others what I had kept hidden inside for too long. It was an opportunity to let my pictures, my carefully crafted words scream to the world. During engagements, people would often cry or thank me for the words that I had expressed in my poetry as they saw their own personal experiences within my words. More than anything, I was proud of the fact that I had managed to make something beautiful out of pain. With each passing day, I grew bolder in claiming my voice, using it like a battlecry, and tackling issues too often fancily concealed. And finally, the time had come to face the one that I had always evaded - the issue of relocating schools. The thought of facing a new environment fraught with new faces and routines was nerve-wracking. As always, I retreated to the safety of my journal, but this time, poetry was not enough. My eagerness and curiosity about the new beginning were increasingly overshadowed by familiar fears, such as the possibility of getting lost and losing previous relationships. So I did something different. I let the words that I put on paper flow into my speech, captivating my auditor with my recital of my deepest anxieties, and the room erupted with thunderous applause. I began to see the way words can be wielded, and how they can serve as agents of change in the world. I learned to assert myself, to be eager to share my thoughts and actively participate in spaces where my opinions mattered. Being involved became thrilling because I had unlocked an integral part of expressing myself through a medium that allowed creativity and honesty. In writing, as in life, there will always be the ones that openly deride you, but in that same vein, there will always be those whose hearts will be touched, strengthened, and mended by the words that spill from the ink or fingertips of the daring. I learned this gradually, that behind every bashfulness, every fear or joy or love, there is a story worth sharing. Words can heal, and when unleashed, they can vividly amplify the beauty that lies beneath the pains that life throws our way. And as I prepare for college, I carry this lesson with me, recognizing that the potential to impact the world, to make a difference or change, is within me to unleash. My passion for writing has shaped me, as well as my journey, showing me that the pen is indeed mightier than the sword, that with every word I offer, I have a chance to reflect on my past, recognize the present, and open my eyes to the potential of tomorrow.",0,2.621656127,2.863562642,3.056886626,3.20670052,2.948502501,17.0,21.0,22.6,28.2,22.0
H,377,"“How prone to doubt, how cautious are the wise!” -Homer “D’oh!” -Homer Simpson I’m not a philosopher; eloquence eludes me, the meaning of life is unquestioned, and thinking, beyond what is required to carry out a potential, is postponed to a more leisurely time. I’ve experienced doubt, and proceeded with caution; and in my experience, I’ve learned to discard unnecessary thought and conventional wisdom in favor of progress. Philosophy amounts to nothing unless it results in action. “You’re kidding.” Scanning my schedule, my classmate shakes her head. “Why didn’t you take Dual Credit?” During Junior year, my high school began to incentivize Dual Credit courses with a GPA multiplier. Advertised to be less demanding than an AP class, Dual Credit was extolled as the wise man’s curriculum. So, mustering all the wisdom I had, I took 6 AP classes, and frankly, I enjoyed their depth. When it comes to education, I’m not cautious – and I’m prone to doubt. I just act. If I want chemistry, then I get chemistry; if I’m intrigued by psychology, then I pursue psychology. There is no point in pondering the inevitable; I am determined to take educational opportunities. I’ll judge the difficulty for myself after I complete it. The practice of prioritizing action has proved useful in my pursuits. In ninth grade, I could have doubted my capability; instead I ran for office in the school’s health club and earned a position in the eleventh grade. That year, there was a debate amongst the members over meeting schedules: if the Technology Students Association meeting coincided with ours, how would we attract new members? As the club officers weighed the costs and benefits amongst themselves, I left the meeting and signed up for the technology club, discussed an agreement, and voted for the technology club to move its meetings to the second half of lunch before scheduling the Health club meetings for the first half. Did it require thinking? No. Eloquence? Hardly. Contrary to the anticipated speeches and club-based patriotism, it only took clear action and a request to solve the conflict. Attendance increased, and as a bonus, I enjoyed a continued membership with both organizations. Beyond the sphere of public education, doubt-free determination facilitated my impact in the community. I am seventeen; I cannot vote in the upcoming elections. However, that does not mean I will hesitate to make a mark with my city. Small actions, from teaching addition to a church member’s kindergartener to tutoring three classmates for the SAT, matter in the long run. Can a teenage end world hunger? Doubtful; but by pulling weeds from the community garden, I can further progress one step at a time. Not all actions end successfully. However, between cautious wisdom and failure, I choose action. I don’t fancy myself as wise; I’m not prone to doubt, nor am I perpetually cautious. I simply pursue my goal. As the wiser Homer has taught America, when torn between success and potential peril, one must simply “D’oh.”",1,1.90545175,2.584266522,2.884053963,3.44062793,2.713573494,5.4,10.8,16.2,21.2,14.0
C0,378,"Throughout human history, there have been countless examples of individuals who have taken action to change the world for the better. From Mahatma Gandhi peacefully leading India to independence, to Martin Luther King Jr. fighting for civil rights in America, there is no denying the importance of taking action. In my own life, I have witnessed the transformative power of taking action to create positive change, and I firmly believe that it is one of the most important things that a person can do. Growing up, I was fortunate enough to live in a safe and supportive community, but even so, I noticed that there were certain problems that needed to be addressed. For example, the public park in our town was frequently littered with trash, and many of the children's play areas were outdated and in need of repair. At first, I felt frustrated that no one seemed to be doing anything about these issues, but eventually, I realized that I was in a position to make a difference myself. I started volunteering at the park on weekends, cleaning up the trash and helping to maintain the equipment. It was hard work, and at times it felt like I was making little progress, but over time, I began to see a real change in the appearance and overall feel of the park. Seeing children and families enjoying the space made me feel proud of what I had accomplished, and it gave me a sense of purpose that I had never felt before. My experience with the park taught me that taking action is not just about fixing a specific problem or achieving a certain goal. It is also about personal growth and empowerment. When you take action, you are demonstrating to yourself and others that you have the ability to effect change. This sense of agency and self-efficacy can be incredibly empowering, and it can give you the confidence to take on even greater challenges in the future. Of course, taking action can be scary, especially when the problems we are trying to solve are big and complex. It can be tempting to wait for someone else to step up and take the lead, but often, that person never appears. In my opinion, this is why it's so important for individuals to take charge and take action when they see a need. Not only does it create positive change, but it also inspires others to join in and take action themselves. One example of this phenomenon is the #MeToo movement, which started with a simple hashtag on social media and quickly grew into a worldwide movement for survivors of sexual assault and harassment. The movement began when one woman, Tarana Burke, shared her own story of assault and used the phrase 'me too' to show solidarity with other survivors. From there, the movement gained momentum, with countless individuals sharing their own stories and demanding change. The impact of the #MeToo movement cannot be overstated. It has led to changes in laws and workplace policies, and it has sparked much-needed conversations about consent and sexual violence. But perhaps even more importantly, it has given a voice to survivors who had previously felt silenced and alone. By taking action, Tarana Burke and others like her were able to create a movement that has not only changed policies and laws, but has also created a community of support for survivors. In conclusion, I believe that taking action is one of the most important things that a person can do. It can create positive change, empower individuals, and inspire others to take action as well. Whether you are cleaning up a park, fighting for civil rights, or sharing your story of survival, every action counts. It may be scary to take that first step, but the rewards are worth it. So, let us all take responsibility for the world around us, and let us all take action to make it a better place.",0,2.553681454,2.866616217,2.98524515,3.314122846,2.890592822,18.6,20.2,23.0,29.4,22.0
C1,379,"Growing up, I was always told that being cautious was the key to success. However, after experiencing the benefits of taking action over cautious wisdom, I have come to the conclusion that the opposite is true. In high school, for example, I was advised by many people to take Dual Credit courses that were considered less demanding than AP classes. However, I decided to take 6 AP classes instead and found that the depth of the courses was satisfying. I believe that when it comes to education, there is no need for caution. If you want to learn something, then you should just go for it. I have found that prioritizing action over caution has been useful throughout my life. It led me to become an officer in the school's health club in ninth grade, which ultimately led to me resolving a scheduling conflict with the technology club. Not only did this resolve the conflict, but it also increased attendance in both clubs. Taking action has also enabled me to make a positive impact in my community. Even though I cannot vote yet, I have participated in numerous community service activities that have made a difference. For example, I have previously pulled weeds from a community garden to further progress one step at a time. I think it is essential to prioritize action over caution because it allows you to grow as a person. When I started my own business in high school, for instance, I not only gained valuable business experience but also learned the importance of taking calculated risks. Even though it was a daunting task at first, I conducted research on the pet industry, created a business plan, and started marketing my homemade dog treats. My business, Doggy Delights, grew in popularity and was ultimately sold in pet stores throughout the region. This experience taught me that taking action can lead to greater rewards than playing it safe all the time. I also applied this approach to my school's debate team, where I became a highly regarded leader. I learned that a decisive leader is not always the person with the most knowledge or experience, but the one who takes necessary action. Thus, I became more proactive in voicing my opinions and ideas, even if it meant going against the consensus. This approach helped me become a more confident speaker and leader overall. As I began researching universities with Ivy League status, I almost talked myself out of applying to Yale or Harvard. However, my internal voice encouraged me to apply, and I spent hours researching the schools, reading biographies of their alumni, and putting together the best application I could. This approach was ultimately successful as I received acceptance letters from both universities. Even though accepting the offer from Yale or Harvard is still ahead, I did not let caution rob me of the opportunity to apply to these prestigious schools. In conclusion, prioritizing action over cautious wisdom has enriched my life by providing me with opportunities to discover my strengths, weaknesses and build a confidence that cannot easily be shaken. Life is full of risks, failures, and stumbling blocks, but this approach has made me more open to new experiences and opportunities that have helped me reach my full potential. I may not always get everything right, and there will probably be times when I make mistakes. However, taking action has allowed me to learn from those mistakes and grow as a person. I intend to continue embracing taking action over caution because I believe it is the best path towards success where you dare to risk it.",0,2.580383851,2.82704659,2.997823171,3.504001362,2.917319612,14.0,18.2,19.4,27.0,19.0
C2,380,"The sun was blazing on that fateful afternoon as I sat in my college counselor's office, searching for answers. Overwhelmed by all the options before me, I sought guidance. Just as the counselor began to speak, my mind began to wander. Then, a quote from my grandfather popped into my head; 'If you want to learn something, then you should just go for it.' With renewed vigor, the counselor's remarks captured my attention. He suggested Dual Credit courses as a safer option, but I had a feeling that the excitement and the breadth of knowledge would be absent compared to that of AP courses. As the bell rang, I decided to enroll in all six AP classes that year. The first day of classes rolled around, and fear crept in. As I walked into my first AP class, I saw an excited and earnest teacher who was eager to impart knowledge to his pupils. The class was buzzing with fresh energy, and the material seemed intriguing. Two months in, and the classes had become a haven for me, where I was enveloped in knowledge that I had never encountered before. I was also an innovative student leader. I started off as the secretary of the school's health club and rose to become the president during my senior year. In the beginning, it was just an idea of implementing healthier habits in my community, but I transformed it to involve collaborating with technology club to facilitate health tech innovation. The solution was to have the technology club create an app to track fitness goals while the health club organized wellness fairs for the student body. Engaging in action over caution has not only enabled me to make my community better but has also given me opportunities to grow as a person. Volunteering has been such a powerful force in my life, as it has allowed me to make a positive impact in the world. I have worked at the local food bank, the children's hospital, and the animal shelter. One day, while volunteering at the shelter, I pulled out weeds from the garden, feeling filthy and sticky from the sap that was smothered on the leaves. As I sat there, wiping beads of sweat from my brow, I realized that even though it was tedious work, it was necessary work. Without these small steps, we would never be able to progress. I distilled this ethos of 'starting small' into my dog treat business, Doggy Delights. I researched the pet industry thoroughly and developed unique recipes that catered to many dog's needs — grain-free, organic, and hypoallergenic. Making the treats was incredibly enjoyable, but it was the marketing that was the true test of my mettle. One particularly hot day, I handed out fliers to dog owners walking their pets in the park. Several dog owners stopped to marvel at these tasty and healthy treats. Soon after, the word of mouth got around, and Doggy Delights was sold in several pet stores across the region. Taking action has propelled me to leadership roles in my school’s debate team, where I was able to prove my worth through my decisive and effective leadership style. At first, I was hesitant to speak in public, but as time went by, I realized that eloquence was not the only measure of leadership effectiveness. During a heated discussion, I found myself to be on the side opposed by the majority. In moments like those, wise counsel would have dictated that I go along with the consensus, but I persevered my opposing view, and our team became more resilient due to the lively debate. As I began researching universities with Ivy League status, the temptation to attend other universities was overwhelming. But a soft inner voice prompted me to apply to Harvard or Yale. Research played a significant factor, while the other was taking the plunge. I spent hours filling out the application and answering essay prompts about my aspirations and achievements that made me stand out. And then, it happened — acceptance letters from both universities! Concluding, prioritizing action over caution has transformed my life by enabling me to discover myself fully; my strengths, weaknesses, and my unassailable resilience. Every day, I am learning valuable lessons through calculated risks, that instill in me the confidence to confront new opportunities head-on. Failure is, in essence, the stepping stone to success. But by acknowledging that risk-taking is the key to learning and growth, I arm myself with the necessary tools to face even the toughest of obstacles. For life is full of risks, but action over caution has significantly enriched my life, making me much stronger, much better, much more capable of greatness.",0,2.610694836,2.992833056,3.133094288,3.411957371,3.098653902,12.0,17.0,21.0,26.0,20.0
H,381,"Most airplanes are constructed with seats in rows of two or three. Mathematically, that means no matter the configuration, someone in my family of five has to sit by a stranger. Ever since I was little, I always asked to be that person. Perhaps it’s the optimistic middle child in me, but I always considered the greatest possibility was that I could meet someone remarkable, and that the conversation could be anything on the spectrum from slightly interesting to life-changing. From the time I could speak, I began to realize that overcoming communication barriers was an integral key to unlocking the enormous potential in constructing meaningful relationships with others. My father is a successful scientist, but he has also been profoundly deaf since birth. My childhood was spent understanding his intelligence while still struggling at times to convey basic needs because I was choosing words that were too difficult to lipread and that I couldn’t yet write. As a kid, I learned how to continually recalibrate my own approach to overcome the challenge of constantly being misunderstood. My ability to build a relationship with my father was contingent on spending a lifetime navigating around the communication barriers that exist for someone who cannot hear. At the time I didn’t foresee I was developing an aptitude for communication skills that would be critical for succeeding in so many other important areas. Since kindergarten, I have loved Chinese culture. My mom got tired of me requesting panda birthday cakes year after year and seeing me dressed as a panda each Halloween until I grew out of every costume. In second grade, I convinced the owner of a noodle house to give me two Chinese lanterns that still hang in my room today. In my junior year of high school, I earned a competitive scholarship from the U.S. State Department to study abroad for the summer learning Mandarin and immersing myself in eastern culture. Being dropped into Chengdu, China when you don’t speak the language fluently and being cut off from all communication back home was not all the cuddly pandas and Tai chi in the park that I had fantasized. Once again, I found myself a toddler, unable to communicate basic needs. I wondered, “Are humans really supposed to eat all the foods you’re giving me?” I quickly learned the Chinese education system is one of unparalleled expectations, not for the meek. With every grade a student receives, they can see their successes or failures broadcasted on a board in front of the class. Each new day tested my adaptability, my resilience, and my digestive system. I, for the first time, realized what it must feel like to be my father on the other side of the communication barrier, not just trying to express my needs, but trying to really understand what others are saying. At the end of the program I was told I had been unanimously voted by my school administration in China to represent the scholarship recipients and deliver a speech on their behalf to over 500 people… in Chinese. The flight was now descending after so many remarkable experiences and conversations with strangers. Throughout my life, I have learned that the path to overcoming communication barriers is to will oneself through them. One must embrace it all and say “yes” to every new and uncomfortable experience. In the end, I returned home with a cultural awareness beyond expectation, possessing lifelong friendships with former strangers whom I now communicate with in their native language, and surprisingly loving the taste of rabbit eyeballs and cow intestines. I am so grateful to have learned and confirmed in my life that stepping out of my comfort zone can, in fact, lead to experiences anywhere on the spectrum from slightly interesting to life-changing. On the flight home from China I, of course, chose to sit next to a stranger… and it didn’t disappoint.",1,2.773158881,3.002919742,3.268528081,3.628682945,3.149012468,14.0,20.0,28.2,33.8,24.0
C0,382,"As I sat on the couch, scrolling through the news on my phone, I watched as yet another story of injustice and inequality filled my screen. The world seemed so divided, so unconnected, so brimming with hate that it was hard to imagine a future where communication and understanding could bring us together. Yet, I found myself more convinced than ever that breaking barriers through communication was the only path forward. Growing up, I was always a bit of an introvert. I found solace in books and music, allowing myself to escape into fictional worlds that were far less complicated and far less cruel than the one I lived in. I was content to live a sheltered life, avoiding confrontation and difficult conversations at all costs. But my worldview was challenged one day when my best friend, who was a member of the LGBTQ+ community, came out to me. At first, I didn't know what to say. I was unprepared for this conversation and didn't want to say the wrong thing or hurt her in any way. But as we talked, I realized that I had been living in a bubble of ignorance, assuming that because I wasn't part of a marginalized group, I didn't have to care about the struggles others faced. Hearing my friend's stories of prejudice and bigotry shook me to my core and made me realize that there were so many people living lives vastly different from my own. This conversation sparked a fire within me. I realized that I couldn't sit idly by while social disparities continued to widen. Breaking barriers through communication became my mission, and I sought out ways to engage with individuals and communities of all backgrounds. I volunteered at a local community center, attended protests, and engaged in online conversations with people from all over the world. Through these experiences, I discovered that while breaking barriers through communication was essential, it wasn't always easy. I encountered people who were resistant to change, who were convinced that their way of life was the only right way. I had conversations that were frustrating and exhausting, where it felt like we were talking but not truly communicating. But it was through these difficult, uncomfortable conversations that I learned the value of empathy and active listening. Empathy is the ability to connect with others on a human level, to understand their experiences and emotions, even if we have never experienced them ourselves. As I engaged in conversations with individuals from all backgrounds, I started to view the world through a new lens, one that allowed me to see the interconnectedness of our experiences. I realized that my experiences as a woman of color were not so different from my friend's experiences as a member of the LGBTQ+ community. We both faced discrimination and judgment, and breaking barriers through communication allowed us to find common ground and connect on a deeper level. Active listening, on the other hand, is the ability to truly hear what someone is saying without judgment or interruption. It's easy to assume that we know what someone is going to say or to dismiss their experiences as insignificant. But I learned that by actively listening, I was able to not only understand their points of view but also find ways to connect with them. By acknowledging someone's experiences and validating their feelings, I was able to build bridges of understanding and connect in meaningful ways. Breaking barriers through communication is not easy, and there are no simple solutions to the complex social problems facing us today. But I believe that by elevating empathy and active listening, we can create meaningful change. We can work to understand and acknowledge the experiences of others, even if they are different from our own. We can engage in conversations that are respectful, inclusive, and challenging, pushing ourselves to think critically and expand our own worldviews. As I write this essay, I am humbled by the challenges we face and the work that lies ahead. But I am also filled with a sense of hope and optimism. I believe that the future lies in our ability to come together, to build bridges of communication and understanding, and to embrace the humanity in all of us. We cannot allow fear and divisiveness to rule our lives. We must break barriers through communication and work to create a society that is truly just, equitable, and inclusive for all.",0,2.486476305,2.72217566,2.843905936,3.244916025,2.773221711,16.0,20.0,21.0,26.0,21.0
C1,383,"Communication barriers pose a significant challenge to anyone trying to form meaningful relationships. Whether it is due to shyness, a lack of confidence, or language barriers, the ability to connect with others can be hindered. However, I have learned that it is possible to overcome communication barriers through a willingness to step out of one's comfort zone and try new things. In my family, we generally have to sit next to strangers when we fly due to the seating arrangements on airplanes. As a child, I always requested to be the one seated next to a stranger because I believed that there was a possibility of having a remarkable conversation. This eagerness for connecting with others stemmed from my experience growing up with my father, who is profoundly deaf. Despite being a successful scientist, he had to navigate communication barriers continually. This experience taught me the importance of overcoming communication barriers to establish meaningful relationships with others. Once I got to high school, I started to experience the same challenges that my father faced due to my introverted nature. I found it difficult to communicate with teachers and peers, and this impacted my ability to form connections with them. However, I decided to take steps to address this issue. One of the things I did was to join the debate team. This forced me to confront my fears of public speaking and practice communicating my ideas and opinions effectively. Through debate, I learned the power of confident communication and the importance of choosing one's words carefully. Debating also taught me the value of effective listening, as one has to listen to their opponent to respond effectively. Another way I overcame communication barriers was through volunteering at a local elderly care home. At first, I found it challenging to interact with residents who had dementia or Alzheimer's. But, I discovered that sometimes the best way to communicate is through nonverbal communication. By holding someone's hand, for example, you can establish a connection even when words fail. Additionally, I found that empathy is a powerful tool to overcome communication barriers. When I came across an elderly resident who was feeling down, listening to them and offering words of comfort went a long way in establishing a connection. Finally, my love for chess helped me form connections with others in a unique way. To play chess effectively, you have to analyze the moves of your opponent and develop a strategy in return, essentially forming a conversation through the game. This realization gave me a newfound appreciation for the game and helped me establish connections with other players. Overall, the experiences that helped me overcome communication barriers have taught me that stepping out of one's comfort zone is crucial to establishing connections with others. Effective communication involves empathy, listening, and the willingness to understand others, even if verbal communication is not possible. As I consider applying to college, I am excited to continue building on these experiences and further hone my communication skills. I am confident that my ability to connect with others will serve me well, no matter where my journey takes me.

C2,384,"Communication barriers can feel like a wall between people, making it impossible to build meaningful connections. It's like standing on one side of a chasm, trying to call out to someone on the other side, but your words get lost in space. Some people might yield to the difficulty and not try, but that's not my story. My family loves to travel, and I would always request the window seat on the airplane with a stranger next to me. I loved the idea of conversing with someone new, learning their story and gaining a new outlook. These views germinated from the experience of growing up with my father, who is profoundly deaf. I saw him navigate communication barriers in everyday life, but he never stopped connecting with people. However, as a freshman in high school, I found myself experiencing communication barriers of my own. My introverted nature came in the way of my ability to express my ideas and connect with others. I knew change was necessary, and so, taking steps to address the problem, I joined the debate team. At first, it was terrifying to stand in front of a microphone and speak my mind. But soon, the thrill of researching and gathering evidence in support of my claims led me to appreciate public speaking. Debating had pushed me to think and communicate effectively by using eloquence and proper words to convey what I cared to say. Honing these tactics, I found the strength to strike a conversation and connect with my classmates and teachers. Ever since I was young, I've always noticed the little things - the importance of a handshake, a smile, a tilting head, and a pat on the back. These subtle movements say more than words ever could. Volunteering at a local elderly home allowed me to appreciate the power of nonverbal communication even more, especially when interacting with people with dementia or Alzheimer's. Being able to communicate even when other methods failed heightened my confidence and empathy. Empathy has always been a salient part of how I interact with others, particularly while playing chess. I recall playing against an opponent who had lost interest in the game, and instead of getting frustrated, something clicked in me. I chose to listen instead of pressing the game, and we talked for an hour about his life story. Then, without noticing, we exchanged moves, and I won. I realized that connecting with people is not always direct. It can be about the small things that might seem inconsequential, like our love for chess. As I prepare for college, I'm keen to push my communication skills to greater heights. Joining clubs with people I have never met, debating on world development issues, discussing scientific research, and exploring the opportunities of meeting people of different backgrounds has never been more essential. These experiences will help me develop my skills in communication and build meaningful relationships with people. In conclusion, communication barriers can seem like the insurmountable abyss between two people. But these barriers can be overcome through trust and gentleness. I have realized that connections are never about being the smartest or most talented, but it's about how we relate to the people we meet. It's about appreciating their differences, listening, and empathizing with their story. I have faith in my abilities to keep learning, keep connecting, and keep building the bonds that make us all human.",0,2.472069974,2.692060819,2.833668702,2.99524366,2.737665379,14.2,16.0,18.0,22.0,16.5
H,385,"When we are small, the world seems infinite. Personally, I believed that Germany was adjacent to Wisconsin until I was 8. But eventually, physical growth lends itself to a greater understanding of the world around us as we become exposed to truths of society. It was easy for me to justify my mom’s long work hours and our pocket-sized apartment filled with black mold when I did not know that everyone else had something “better”—and for me, it never felt like I was worse off, it just felt different. My friend had blue eyes and a house. I had brown eyes and I got free lunch. But as I learned more about the world, I found that those differences became difficult to overlook as people grew up and closed their minds in order to conform to their roles in society. My mom’s young age, financial status, and lack of a degree, as well as my lack of a second parent were all characteristics I saw in people who were portrayed to me as failures. It was a harsh reality to accept, because my mom was anything but a failure; she worked tirelessly, prioritizing my needs over hers and resigning herself to fast food jobs because she could not go to college while supporting a newborn. She grew up much faster than any 20-year-old should have to. And yet, for all her strength, we received looks of pity and degradation. But for all the vitriol, we steadfastly refused to let the judgments of other ruin us. When my mother worked late, she left me with her oldest friends, Brian and Eric. They discussed everything—politics, philosophy, physics, beer; and for every question I had, they had insightful and honest responses, even when I demanded to know what was so special about Indiana Pale Ale when I was five. They inspired my passion for learning and taught me about the world while my mom worked to make sure we still had a home. Brian was a chef. Most conversations happened while he sautéed mushrooms or julienned peppers. Years passed, and on the night he made risotto, I stood in the kitchen and asked about welfare. I knew my mom and I had it, but I failed to understand the negative connotation surrounding it. They explained that people often have misconstrued ideas about welfare; they become close-minded to the lifestyles and perspectives of others as they adhere to their own confining positions as members of society. This made sense, but it did not seem fair, particularly after school that day. “Today a girl laughed at me because we have welfare,” I mumbled, shifting uncomfortably. “She said her mom said my mom shouldn’t be in the PTA if she can’t even come to meetings because she’s working.” Brian and Eric exchanged heavy glances, but I rambled on, voice shaking as I realized at the same time as everyone else in the room that this incident had affected me more than I initially thought it had. “My mom works really hard. For us. To keep us safe and fed and okay. They don’t get to say she isn’t doing enough when she’s trying her best.” They hesitated the way adults do before having serious conversations. “Kiddo—there are a lot of things about the world that aren’t fair. This is one of them,” Brian started. “That girl and her mom try to tear down people like you and your mom because they have no perception of how hard you two work to be where you are. They won’t try to understand because they don’t want to. And that’s not on you, that’s on them.” And I understood. I knew that my mom and I worked hard. Welfare did not make me anyone’s inferior; instead, it taught me about perspective. People are quick to judge what they do not know or understand, because empathy is not indoctrinated in people as well as derision and hatred are. Empathy and morality are traits that I believe take priority over any other; I care about how people treat each other, because I have seen the damage that results when people become too self-involved to care about how their words affect others. The best way for me to inspire that empathy is through arts and humanities. Brian and Eric helped cultivate my passion for learning about people and for evoking emotion within them to form meaningful connections, and whether it is through art, literature, or human sciences, I want to be someone who can open people up to different perspectives, and I want to do it by learning as much as I can so that I have something to give back.",1,2.261971841,2.438830357,2.704885767,3.126169556,2.615916401,9.0,13.0,18.0,33.2,14.0
C0,386,"As I sat in church on a Sunday morning, I couldn't help but overhear a whispered conversation behind me. A woman expressed her disapproval of government welfare programs, stating that the recipients were simply lazy and undeserving. I was struck by her lack of empathy and understanding for the individuals who depended on these programs to survive. Growing up in a middle-class family, I was sheltered from the reality of poverty and the struggle to make ends meet. It wasn't until I started volunteering at a local homeless shelter that I began to truly understand the issue of poverty and the importance of welfare programs. At the shelter, I listened to the stories of the individuals who had been dealt a difficult hand in life. One woman had lost her job due to downsizing and was forced to live on the streets with her two young children. Another man had struggled with addiction and found himself homeless after losing everything he had to the disease. I saw firsthand how these individuals were not simply 'lazy,' but were victims of circumstance. As I continued to volunteer, I realized that empathy was a key component in the fight against poverty. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It is the ability to put oneself in someone else's shoes and see the world from their perspective. Without empathy, we cannot fully understand or address the issues facing our communities. However, empathy alone is not enough. In order to truly make a difference, we must also redefine the way we view welfare programs. Rather than seeing them as a handout for lazy individuals, we must recognize them as a safety net for those who have fallen on hard times. Welfare programs are designed to provide assistance to those in need, whether it be food assistance, housing subsidies, or healthcare. These programs are not designed to be a permanent solution, but rather a temporary fix to help individuals get back on their feet. But why do so many people view welfare programs negatively? One reason may be the stereotype that individuals who receive welfare are lazy and undeserving. This stereotype is perpetuated by media outlets and politicians who push their own agendas and fail to recognize the diversity of the individuals who depend on these programs. Another reason may be the lack of empathy and understanding for those in need. It can be difficult to relate to someone who has faced different struggles and comes from a different background. However, without empathy, we cannot fully understand the importance of welfare programs and the impact they have on people's lives. So how do we change the narrative and redefine welfare and empathy? It starts with education and awareness. We need to have open and honest conversations about poverty and the importance of welfare programs in our communities. We need to break down the stereotypes and show the diversity of the individuals who depend on these programs. Secondly, we need to practice empathy in our daily lives. We should strive to understand the struggles of others and support those who are in need. By volunteering at homeless shelters or food banks, we can gain a better understanding of the issues facing our communities and see firsthand the impact of welfare programs. Finally, we need to advocate for policies that support those in need. This includes pushing for increased funding for welfare programs and fighting against policies that seek to dismantle them. It also means supporting policies that address the root causes of poverty, such as affordable housing and access to education and healthcare. As I prepare to graduate high school and embark on the next chapter of my life, I am determined to bring the lessons I have learned to my college and my community. I believe that by redefining welfare and empathy, we can create a society that truly cares for its most vulnerable members. Empathy and understanding are key to building a stronger and more just society. By acknowledging the struggles of those in need and supporting welfare programs, we can break down the stereotypes and create a more inclusive community. As the famous quote by Martin Luther King Jr. goes, 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' We must come together as a community and fight to ensure that everyone is given the opportunity to live a fulfilling and dignified life.",0,2.566396661,2.781755353,2.978774995,3.248657461,2.889672231,13.0,18.0,19.4,22.2,18.5
C1,387,"As a child, everything in my life seemed normal. It wasn't until I grew older that I realized how different my upbringing was from those around me. I was raised in a low-income household, where money was always tight and resources were scarce. My parents worked long hours to make ends meet, but no matter how hard they tried, it never seemed to be enough. Despite these circumstances, my experience of adversity has taught me the importance of empathy and how it can lead to personal growth and achievement. Growing up, I often felt like an outsider as I watched my peers take for granted the luxuries that I could only dream of. It wasn't until I started volunteering at local food banks and participating in service projects that I began to understand that my experience of poverty was not unique. Many of the people I met had experienced similar struggles in their lives, and it was through their stories that I learned the power of empathy. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It is this skill that has allowed me to connect with people from all walks of life and see the world through their eyes. Empathy has not only helped me to form meaningful connections with others, but it has also allowed me to grow and learn from those experiences. I remember a particular instance where empathy allowed me to see beyond my own experiences and into those of another person. I was at school when a friend told me about a difficult situation she was dealing with at home. Instead of offering empty reassurances or trying to one-up her with my own problems, I simply listened. In that moment, I realized the power of truly empathizing with someone and being present for them, even if there was nothing else I could do to help. Empathy has also helped me to recognize the harm that can come from making assumptions about others. Having been on the receiving end of such assumptions myself, I know how deeply they can hurt. It is only through empathy that we can begin to understand that everyone has their own unique story, and that we cannot judge them based on stereotypes or assumptions. As I've grown older and started to think about my future, empathy has become an even more essential part of my life. The experiences of my life have inspired a passion in me for advocacy and social justice, and it is through empathy that I hope to make a difference. I believe that by empathizing with others, we can create a kinder, more understanding world that values all people, regardless of their background or circumstance. With this in mind, I plan to continue to pursue opportunities that allow me to learn about people from all walks of life. I plan to major in psychology or sociology, as I believe these fields will give me the tools I need to understand and empathize with others on a deeper level. I also plan to participate in service projects and volunteer work, as I know the importance of giving back to the community and helping those in need. In conclusion, the experience of growing up in poverty has taught me the importance of empathy and the power it has to transform our lives and the world around us. It has taught me that everyone has a story, and that through empathy, we can begin to understand and relate to those stories in a way that surpasses our differences. I am excited for what the future holds, and I am eager to continue learning from the people around me, using empathy as my guide.",0,2.656644378,2.845323155,2.945482247,3.183655756,2.869282537,17.2,22.4,25.0,28.0,24.0
C2,388,"I remember the first time I volunteered at a local homeless shelter. The smell of stale air mixed with the stench of dirty clothes almost made me turn around and leave. But as I walked around the shelter, I saw the faces of the people who lived there. Some were old and wrinkled, others were young and scared. They were all people with stories, histories, and struggles that I couldn't even begin to fathom. One of the most impactful moments of that experience was when I met a man named Michael. He was soft-spoken and gentle, but when he spoke, his words were profound. He had lived on the streets for several years, and he talked about the challenges of trying to rebuild his life with no support system. But he also spoke about his resilience and the importance of having empathy. He shared how the simple act of someone looking him in the eye and asking how he was doing gave him a sense of worth and dignity. Michael's story made me realize that true empathy goes beyond surface-level understanding. It's about acknowledging the complexity and nuance of someone's experiences and recognizing their worth as human beings. As I continued to volunteer at the shelter, I also became more aware of the systemic inequities that contribute to homelessness. I saw how policies and institutions disproportionately impact certain communities, leading to cycles of poverty and despair. But I also saw how empathy can lead to meaningful change. Volunteers and staff members worked together to develop programs that address the root causes of homelessness. They worked to improve access to resources like mental health services and affordable housing. Through my experiences, I realized that empathy is not just a buzzword or a nice sentiment. It's a powerful tool for building more equitable societies. It requires us to be vulnerable, to listen to others' stories, and to challenge our own assumptions. In college, I continued to explore issues related to social justice through classes and extracurricular activities. I worked with a student-led organization focused on building inclusive communities on campus, and I also interned with a local nonprofit that provided legal services to immigrant communities. Through these experiences, I learned that creating change is not easy. It requires difficult conversations, self-reflection, and a willingness to take risks. But I also learned that it's possible to make a difference, even in the face of overwhelming challenges. As I consider applying to top-tier universities like Yale or Harvard, I feel both excited and daunted by the prospect. But I also know that I am equipped with the tools and perspectives necessary to excel in this environment. I understand that these institutions are often associated with privilege and wealth, but I believe that they also have the potential to be catalysts for positive change. By bringing my own experiences and perspectives to the table, I hope to contribute to a more inclusive and equitable campus community. In conclusion, empathy is not only a moral imperative, but also a practical tool for creating a more just world. It involves seeing people for who they truly are, recognizing their struggles and strengths, and working collaboratively to build more equitable societies. As I continue on my own journey, I am committed to cultivating empathy in myself and in others, and to using it as a bridge to creating meaningful change.",0,2.515496016,2.7220426,2.944942185,3.163105733,2.85352515,12.2,16.0,17.6,21.8,17.0
H,389,"In Fyodor Dostoevsky’s, “Crime and Punishment”, the character Sonia is metaphorically linked to Christ. After prostituting herself to feed her family, she covers her head and face in shawls, before lying on her bed face down and sobbing– through this, she is linked to the death of Jesus. Her mother, Katarina, kisses her feet while she sobs, the same way people in the churches of that time wept and kissed at the feet of idols to Christ. In this situation, Dostoevsky is implying that even something such as prostitution that might be deemed a sin can instead be that which allows one to be a Saint. As my mother choked up while I described the above anecdote, I was filled with confusion. What could lead her to be so upset over this philosophical question? I asked if there was something she wanted to talk about and to say there was would be an understatement. She described to me the process by which my Father, in pursuit of a sexual relationship with a young woman, had demolished our family’s house, and all of my Mom’s identifying documents, before successfully taking away both me and my brother. While my father wasn’t on my birth certificate for a Welfare bid, and my mother regained custody of me, my brother had to remain in the care of a man who put little emphasis on caring for his sons at that point in his life. My mother was left with no money, no place to live, and no friends who would lend their support. She turned to her sister for guidance and instead of love and compassion was met with cruelty, deceit, and greed. My mother found a parallel between herself and Sonia. Both were faced with a problem the likes of which seems unsolvable and were thrust into a patriarchal system that far too often values little of women beyond the most primitive desires. Despite constant attempts to get herself onto a more admirable path, the system resisted her. She could not afford to purchase new identifying documents without missing rent, and I couldn’t handle being paraded through 105-degree weather. She was stuck. My dad came back and offered to continue their relationship after more than a year of abject poverty and lack of bodily autonomy. And she accepted the invitation into the man who had ruined her life for me. After going through a phase of alcoholism and an instance of domestic violence against my Father, I viewed my mother as immoral, or misguided at the least. I was wrong. Despite experiencing some of the worst things a human can experience, and being able to tell nobody about it, she remained in a household with a man who intentionally hurt her beyond belief, for my well being. If there is a God above us, he views Sonia and my Mother not as sinners, but as Saints, and in that conviction, I could not be more absolute.",1,2.58485129,2.890028897,3.308190488,3.504113538,3.204160793,14.2,19.4,25.4,31.4,20.5
C0,390,"Throughout my life, I have been lucky to have not one, but two incredible role models who have taught me about the values of compassion, selflessness, and perseverance. Although they are very different from one another in many ways, my mother and my grandmother Sonia, both reflect the essence of a saintly figure. Sonia, my grandmother, is the matriarch of our family. She was born in a small village in Puerto Rico where opportunities were limited, and the world seemed much bigger than her. Despite the challenges, she managed to make her way to the United States in order to provide her family with a better future. Sonia is the kind of person who radiates warmth and kindness, and her presence has a calming effect on people. She is known for her unwavering faith and selflessness - always ready to lend a hand to anyone in need. Whether it is through a home-cooked meal or by simply offering a listening ear, she shows that everyone deserves care and attention. I have always admired the way Sonia has never given up on the people she cares about. Even in moments of hardship or difficulty, she remains steadfast in her belief that things will get better with time. Her resilience has taught me that setbacks are not failures, but opportunities for growth and learning. My mother, too, has always been a force of positivity in my life. She has instilled in me the importance of hard work, determination, and empathy. Growing up in a single-parent household, my mother faced many challenges early on. Despite this, she made certain that her children knew that they were loved and supported every step of the way. Her ability to remain optimistic even in the worst of circumstances is a testament to her strength of character. My mother is the one who taught me how to be kind in my own right. She has always emphasized the importance of showing kindness to others, reminding me that a simple act of empathy can go a long way in making someone's day brighter. Whether it is through volunteering at a local hospital or befriending someone who feels left out, she inspires me to be a beacon of hope and positivity for those around me. How can two people be so different, yet embody the same values? To me, Sonia and my mother represent the true definition of what it means to live a life of service. Although they may not be officially canonized as Catholic saints, I see their actions as nothing less than divine. As a student, I too have taken inspiration from their examples of tireless dedication to others. I have regularly volunteered at our local hospital, spending time with patients who may not have anyone else to talk to. Seeing the impact that even a brief conversation can have on someone's day, I am reminded of the value of taking time out of busy schedules in order to help others. Furthermore, I have taken up the mantle of being a mentor to a younger student from a disadvantaged background through an after-school program in our city. My goal is to inspire him to reach for the stars and to help him see that he has potential that is yet to be unlocked. Just as my mother and grandmother have done for me, I hope to instill in him a sense of resilience and determination that will propel him to achieve whatever he wants in life. It is the influence of these two incredible women that drove me to pursue higher education at a top-tier institution. I firmly believe that my values of kindness, empathy, and selflessness will be further honed at such an institution, and I am eager to continue learning from exceptional people around me. In conclusion, the paths that Sonia and my mother have taken throughout their lives embody the essence of what it means to be saintly figures. Their unwavering dedication to others has inspired me to take up a life of service to others as well. As I move on to college, I know that I carry within me the values that were instilled in me by these two amazing women, and I am excited to continue discovering new ways to live out these ideals each and every day.",0,2.740895439,2.87860375,3.124580916,3.315115638,2.899380511,16.0,20.0,22.0,27.2,20.0
C1,391,"The media has long portrayed the saints as pious individuals who perform miracles and possess a divine connection with God. However, in my life, I have been lucky enough to encounter two women who, while not canonized by the Catholic Church, have become my unofficial role models of sainthood. My grandmother Sonia and my mother Cindy may have different personalities and come from distinct backgrounds, but they both embody strong values of faith, compassion, and resilience that have inspired me to strive toward sainthood in my own way. Sonia, my grandmother, came to the US from a small village in Puerto Rico in search of a better life. With limited formal education, she took what work she could find, often juggling multiple jobs to provide for her family. Despite the hardships she faced, Sonia did not let her circumstances deflate her faith. She remained a devout Catholic, attending mass regularly and taking any opportunity to serve the church and the less fortunate. Growing up, Sonia would often remind me that we were blessed in spite of our difficulties. She would say that seeking God's will and doing what we could to help others was our best hope for a better life. Her selflessness and charity frequently extended beyond the family. I remember her taking in stray animals, helping neighbors with home repairs, and even inviting complete strangers to our dinner table. Sonia taught me that serving others, especially when it is inconvenient, is a mark of true sainthood. My mother Cindy, while not as religious as Sonia, demonstrates her own brand of saintliness. As a single mother, she bravely took on the raising of my brother and me. With limited financial resources, she worked multiple jobs and sacrificed personal time to ensure we had opportunities for education and personal growth. Despite the obstacles she faced, my mother instilled in me the value of empathy and compassion. She encouraged me to put myself in other people's shoes and to do my best to help where I could. One cold winter, my mother and I delivered coats and blankets to homeless individuals on the streets of Chicago. Seeing the look of gratitude on their faces was a reminder that small gestures can make a significant impact on people's lives. In preparing for college admission, some may feel the pressure to have performed 'miracles' like some saints in the past. However, my mother and my grandmother have taught me that one does not have to be perfect or perform extraordinary deeds to be a saint. Rather, it is in the small acts and the quiet dedication to others where one can find sainthood. As I look towards college, I am eager to continue the work that my mother and grandmother have started. I am excited about the opportunity to find new ways to serve others and to live out my faith in practice. Whether it's through volunteer work, mentorship, or even donating to a charity, every little bit counts. In conclusion, my grandmother Sonia and my mother Cindy have shown me that living a life of service and faith is a path to sainthood. Their dedication to others, even in the face of challenges, has inspired me beyond words. As I prepare for college, I will carry their lessons with me and do my best to honor their example in everything I do.",0,2.820028175,2.891562679,3.056270879,3.36498625,2.905569401,16.0,19.0,20.0,22.6,20.0
C2,392,"The aroma of fresh-baked bread fills the air as my grandmother Sonia sings old hymns to herself. She sets the loaf down with a gentle thud and kisses my cheek, smiling as she recalls her own grandmother's bread recipe. Her wrinkled hands may have a few scars from years of hard work, but they are nonetheless soft to the touch, conveying warmth and care. These sensory details, such as the smell of fresh bread and the softness of hands, help paint a vivid picture of Sonia's character. It shows that despite the struggles she faced, she remains a gentle and nurturing presence in her family's lives. Similarly, the small action of kissing her grandson's cheeks conveys her deep love and warmth toward her family, making her more relatable and human despite her piousness. Likewise, my mother Cindy's commitment to compassion can be seen in her daily life. Watching her navigate through her job as a nurse, I always marveled at how she maintained her kindness and patience even when encountering difficult or challenging patients. I remember when she used to apply bandages for me after I scraped my knee while playing football, wrapping me in a warm embrace to make me feel calm. Moments like these are crucial in demonstrating Cindy's empathy and kindness. Rather than directly stating that she is compassionate, sharing these examples lets the reader see for themselves how she embodies this value. In doing so, the reader feels a deeper connection with Cindy and understands why she is such an important role model to the writer. Ultimately, one cannot fully embody sanctity if one cannot relate and connect to those around them. My grandmother and mother's small actions and compassion demonstrate how they have found a path to sainthood. While they may not have performed 'miracles,' their generosity and dedication to serving others illustrate how holiness can be achieved in daily life. Their example has inspired me to strive towards this in my own life. While I may not be a physician or a nurse like my mother, nor have Sonia's selflessness, I can always find ways to show empathy and kindness towards others. Whether it's volunteering at a local shelter or helping a neighbor with their yard work, these small steps are crucial to making the world a better place. As I embark on my college journey, I will carry the lessons my grandmother and mother have taught me with me. I will continue to seek new and innovative ways to serve others and make a positive impact in the world. And while I may never be canonized by the Catholic Church, the example of my grandmother and mother has shown me that sainthood is not an unattainable dream, but a reality that can be achieved through a life of compassion and service.",0,2.83025846,2.980190535,3.158024145,3.380779002,3.095505624,17.0,21.0,23.0,27.0,22.0
H,393,"The craft of storytelling, for me, is holy. Looking back on my life, I don’t see one defining moment where I realized that my purpose is to study, compose, and teach story. It’s more like a collection of snapshots whipping by, each one yellowed with age and fingerprints. I remember reading The Empty Space by Peter Brook on theatre theory long into the night, encountering the line, “Drama was exposure, it was confrontation… it led to… an awakening of understanding.” These words were what led me to the discovery of how storytelling is an emotional confrontation between the author and the writing and between the writing and the audience. It’s collision. It’s catharsis. Catharsis defines me as a playwright. The first play I wrote, The Rocket Man, adapted from a short story of the same name by Ray Bradbury, follows a teenage boy whose astronaut father spends much of his time in space. It’s uncanny – that’s my entire life. My own father travels from Denver to Los Angeles four days a week on business, and my family isn’t whole unless he’s with us. Drafting a scene of The Rocket Man, where the boy confronts his father before he leaves again, changed my life: Stay with me, the boy begged in the original scene I added. Please. I immediately began to cry, praying that my own father, a thousand miles away, was listening. I learned that day that catharsis is releasing my own story within a story. When the line between my soul and the soul of my story blurs, that’s when the real work happens. The construct of The Rocket Man was like a cathedral, with my own emotion as stained glass and my memories as arches, but I realized after sharing it with my cast and crew for the first time that a cathedral is nothing without people to experience it. My 18-year-old male lead, Pierce, cried when he first read the script. So did my light designer and sound designer. What I want is to recreate this experience for an audience as a playwright with the intention of establishing the theatre as a safe place. You can grieve here. You can be seen here. You can hope here. This goal starts not just with craft, but with overwhelming love for that audience. At its core, storytelling is service. One of the defining challenges of my life presented itself as the opportunity to create and execute a free playwriting course for middle-school girls. When the pandemic hit, it forced me to reimagine my course for a virtual setting offered through the local school district; I realigned everything – my three-week curriculum, my downloadable course exercises, and my teaching strategies. Teaching playwriting to middle-school girls over Zoom meant listening to their struggle to make friends at school and their desire to participate in protest marches against the will of their parents. With each lesson, they experienced the transcendence of having their lives and emotions reflected through story, and they loved it. One student, Isabel, told me with ten exclamation points about how excited she was for class. She even filmed a one-woman version of a play she wrote, complete with costumes and accents. I came out of class every night feeling like I might burst from joy. Showing students how to release their own story within a story is the most purposeful thing I have ever done. Sitting in a theatre as the overture starts, hearing a thousand conversations stop in the span of a single heartbeat. A hand over my mouth in awe as I watch the finale and wonder at how a two-hour show can contain all the nuances of life. That’s why I exist – to offer story. To teach it. That’s my mission and my ministry.",1,2.192191118,2.470538154,2.894596892,3.113367682,2.622762747,6.0,12.8,17.8,24.8,16.0
C0,394,"As a child, I was always drawn to stories. Whether they were told to me by my parents before bed or read to me in class, I was mesmerized by the way a well-crafted narrative could transport me to another world. I soon realized that this art of storytelling was more than just a form of entertainment; it had the power to shape the way we see ourselves and the world around us. Over the years, my love for storytelling has grown into a passion that has driven me to become a writer. As I explore the craft of storytelling, I've come to understand that it is more than just putting words on paper. A successful story requires a masterful combination of character development, plot, and setting to create a narrative that is both relatable and meaningful. Stories connect us with each other, allowing us to share experiences and emotions. It’s why movies, TV shows, and books continue to captivate us. But the art of storytelling is not limited to just those mediums. It encompasses everything from a comedian's stand-up routine to a politician's stump speech. The best storytellers have the ability to captivate their audience and leave a lasting impression. One of my favorite examples of storytelling is in the Pixar film 'Up.' The first 10 minutes of the movie are a masterclass in storytelling. In just a few short scenes, we see the love story of Carl and Ellie play out, from the excitement of their early years to the struggles of old age. We get to see how their dreams and aspirations change as they grow together. All of this is done without a single word of dialogue. It's a testament to the power of visual storytelling, and it shows how much can be communicated through the smallest details. But storytelling is not just about the mechanics of plot and character development. A good story needs to have a deeper meaning. It needs to resonate with the reader or viewer on a personal level. This is where my passion for storytelling intersects with my interest in social justice. Growing up in a small town, I was sheltered from many of the injustices that exist in the world. But as I became more aware of issues like inequality and systemic racism, I realized that storytelling could be a powerful tool for creating social change. Stories have the power to bring attention to issues that might otherwise go unnoticed. They can challenge our preconceived notions and inspire us to take action. To me, the best stories are the ones that make us feel something. They can make us laugh or cry, but they also have the power to inspire empathy and understanding. When we see a character struggle with a difficult decision or experience a loss, we can relate to their pain on a deep level. This emotional connection is what makes storytelling such a powerful tool. As a writer, I strive to create stories that have an impact on the world around us. I want to write stories that not only entertain but also challenge the status quo. I believe that storytelling can be a means of giving a voice to the underrepresented and the marginalized. At the same time, I recognize that storytelling can also serve as a means of perpetuating harmful narratives. It's important to recognize the inherent biases that exist within our storytelling, whether they are conscious or unconscious. We need to be mindful of the stories we tell and the impact they have on our society. As I prepare to enter college, I look forward to exploring the craft of storytelling further. I want to learn from the masters of the trade, both in the world of literature and beyond. I want to study the techniques that have been used to create some of the most powerful and memorable stories in history. More than anything, I want to become a better storyteller myself. I want to develop my own unique voice and style. I want to create stories that resonate with people and make a difference in the world. In conclusion, the craft of storytelling is a powerful tool for connecting us with each other, creating social change, and giving voice to the underrepresented. As I continue on my journey as a writer, I will strive to create stories that have an impact, challenge the status quo, and inspire empathy and understanding. I plan to study the craft of storytelling at the highest level, honing my skills in characters, setting and plot to become a better storyteller myself. By telling meaningful and impactful stories, I hope to make a difference in the world around me.",0,2.470949693,2.697282811,2.844804796,3.059448084,2.753948455,12.0,14.0,18.0,22.2,16.0
C1,395,"Storytelling is more than just an art form to me; it is a form of worship. I can’t recall a single moment where I decided that I was meant to create, teach, and study stories. Instead, it feels like a series of snapshots, each memory with its own emotional weight, like a collection of dusty old photo albums. It was only after reading The Empty Space by Peter Brook that I began to understand that the craft of writing was emotional confrontation between the author, the writing, and the audience. It was a cathartic release of one's story within a story. I first experienced this when I wrote my play, The Rocket Man, adapted from a short story by Ray Bradbury. As I wrote a scene where the young protagonist pleads for his astronaut father not to leave again, I found myself in tears, hoping that my father, who lived thousands of miles away, could hear me. My first playwriting experience made me realize that storytelling is more than just an expression of oneself, but a tool to connect with others. When my cast and crew, including my 18-year-old male lead who cried after reading the script, saw my play, I realized that a story is incomplete without an audience. For me, storytelling is a form of service that I provide to others, and it is what inspired me to teach a playwriting course to middle school girls. When the pandemic forced my teaching to transfer to a virtual class, I had to rethink my entire syllabus. Teaching playwriting online meant listening to their stories and struggles with becoming friends at school and wanting to join protests against their parents' wishes. As we delved into my three-week curriculum, my students began to experience catharsis and transcend their own experiences through their writing. One student, Isabel, even produced a one-woman version of her play, complete with costumes and accents. It gave me a sense of purpose, knowing that I was empowering others to find their own story within a story. There are few things that will move me more than sitting in a theater as the overture begins, watching as a thousand conversations in the room come to a halt. As the finale ends, everything stands still, and there is a feeling of awe at how a two-hour show has captured every nuance of life. It is a reminder that storytelling can be a tool that connects us all - regardless of our culture, language, or geography. My experiences with storytelling have convinced me that it is not only an art form but a divine mission. It is a way to create empathy, inspire change, and drive progress. I have seen how this art form can break down barriers and encourage mutual understanding, empowering those who may feel unheard or marginalized. This has led me to start a storytelling initiative in my school, one that encourages students to share their personal stories and experiences with the broader community. Through this initiative, I have seen how storytelling can empower others to effect positive change within their communities. As I look to the future, I am excited to explore how storytelling can be used as a tool for positive change. A Yale or Harvard education would provide me with the tools and resources required to further my understanding of this art form and its transformative power. I hope to engage with other scholars who have harnessed storytelling to tackle issues such as social justice, environmental sustainability, and education. I also look forward to learning from other passionate storytellers who share my mission of using this art form to bring people together. In conclusion, storytelling is a form of worship and a divine voice that connects people, creates empathy, and drives progress. It is more than just an expression of oneself; it is a tool to connect with others, inspire change, and create a better world for ourselves and others. As I embark on this next chapter of my academic journey, I am eager to explore the ways in which a Yale or Harvard education will help me harness the full potential of storytelling and its transformative power.",0,2.755587951,3.077066124,3.166431442,3.515345885,3.12587959,19.0,21.6,23.4,28.0,22.5
C2,396,"The sun was beating down on my skin, and the salty smell of the ocean filled the air. The sand between my toes was a reminder of childhood memories spent building sandcastles and playing with friends. It was here where I first realized my love for storytelling. One summer, my family and I went to a local theater to watch a play. As the curtains rose, I was transported to another world. The characters came to life before my eyes, and their stories captivated me like nothing I had ever experienced before. From that moment on, I was hooked. I would attend the same play every weekend and take notes, analyzing and contemplating the nuances in each performance. As I grew older, I discovered that storytelling is more than just entertainment - it is a way of connecting with others. It is a form of emotional confrontation, a cathartic release of one's story within a story. It was through my senior year high school literature honors course, that I had the opportunity to explore this concept further. The fusion of literary criticism and creative writing interested me immensely; symbolism, motifs, and themes, became part of my writing arsenal. It was then that I began writing my own short stories, where the smells, sounds, sights, and textures came to life. One of my favorite stories called 'The Birch Tree' was a work of fiction inspired by my summers spent in my grandfather's farm. I used the smells of freshly mowed grass, hay, and manure to paint a picture of a countryside farm. As the protagonist, Emmy, found solace under the shade of the birch tree, the sounds of chirping birds and the rustling of leaves created a peaceful atmosphere. These same writing skills are what led me to teach playwriting to middle school girls. During a virtual class amid the pandemic, my students shared stories of struggles to make friends in school and wanting to join protests against their parents' wishes. It dawned on me that the art of storytelling was not just about me creating an outlet for my students, but also about receiving the cathartic release that came with reading their works of art. It is this idea that I desire to take with me to Yale or Harvard, to continue my growth as a storyteller, even when not directly writing. In my view, storytelling remains an essential element of life, from business presentations to communicating empathy during interpersonal discussions. The skills and critical analysis that Yale or Harvard would equip me with will propel me towards success in not just the creative arts but in other areas of life. Through this education, I hope to continue to grow storytelling initiatives that inspire change within our society. My storytelling initiative has taught me that storytelling can be utilized to transfigure communities by inspiring empathy and encouraging mutual understanding. As a Yale or Harvard student, I hope to learn from scholars who have effectively harnessed storytelling to address issues such as social justice, environmental sustainability, and education. In conclusion, storytelling is an immersive experience that allows us to connect with others on a deeper level. It is through stories that we empathize, inspire change, and create a better world for ourselves and those around us. Whether through playwriting, short stories, or a formal presentation, storytelling is an art form that transcends barriers, bringing the audience to an emotionally transformative place. I can think of no better place to continue my study of this art form than at Yale or Harvard.",0,2.776993188,2.937662121,3.156163375,3.487988918,3.056185923,16.6,19.0,21.0,25.8,20.0
H,397,"“You should scrub off the top layer of your skin whenever you lose a round,” my debate teammate once advised me. “That’s not practical,” I replied. “Neither is your refusal to wear clothes you’ve lost important debate rounds in. Your wardrobe has very little to do with your success.” Half of me disagrees with him. I still bring three BIC Round Stic pencils with 0.7 lead to every test because my gut tells me this fastidious procedure raises my scores. I’m still convinced that labs receive better grades if written in Calibri. And I still won’t rewear clothes in which I’ve lost crucial rounds. Yet the other half of me is equally dismissive of my own superstitions. I love logic, never failing to check that steps in a proof lead to a precise conclusion without gaps in reasoning. Fortunately, I often abandon my penchant for pragmatism to accommodate for my unwarranted superstitions. And since I only feel the need to act logicalcally in selective situations, I am perfectly content with the illogical nature of my other habits: Raised with my great-grandmother, grandparents, and parents all under one roof, I never lacked a consultant to help me transcribe Korean holiday dates from the lunar calendar onto my schedule. Yet whenever all four generations of my family celebrates with a traditional meal of bulgogi, my untraceable and admittedly nonexistent Italian blood flares in protest; I rebelliously cook myself linguine con le vongole that clashes terribly with my mom’s pungent kimchi. If I plot a graph of “hours I spend in physical activity” versus “week of the year,” the result looks like an irregular cardiac cycle. The upsurges symbolize my battles with colossal walls of water in hopes of catching a smooth surf back to Mission Bay shore. The ensuing period of rest mirrors the hours I spend researching in that one spot in my debate team’s war room that isn’t covered in papers (yet), or at the piano sight-reading the newest Adele song. Then the diastolic tranquility is interrupted by the weekends when I’m sprinting through trenches to avoid paintballs swarming above my favorite arena at Paintball USA. I find comfort in the familiar. I treasure the regular midnight chats with my brother as we indulge in batter while baking cupcakes for a friend’s birthday, keeping our voices hushed to avoid waking our mom and facing her “salmonella is in your near future” lecture. Yet, some of my fondest memories involve talking to people with whom I share nothing in common. Whether my conversations are about the Qatari coach’s research on Kuwait’s female voting patterns, or about the infinite differences between the “common app” and the Oxford interviewing process, or even about my friend’s Swedish school’s peculiar policy of mandating uniforms only on Wednesdays, I love comparing cultures with debaters from different countries. My behavior is unpredictable. Yet it’s predictably unpredictable. Sure, I’ll never eat a Korean dinner like one might expect. But I’ll always be cooking linguine the moment I catch a whiff of kimchi.",1,2.433662701,2.773639572,3.11136464,3.758558992,2.925313585,11.6,14.0,21.0,29.4,16.5
C0,398,"As a child, I was intrigued by my grandmother's superstitions. She always carried a red string bracelet on her wrist to ward off evil spirits and placed garlic cloves in every corner of her house to protect it from the evil eye. These seemingly illogical rituals fascinated me, and I began to question the reasoning behind them. Were they just blind beliefs, or did they reflect her cultural identity and upbringing? Superstitions and traditions are often considered irrational or unscientific, but they play an essential role in shaping one's identity and cultural heritage. I grew up in a family that valued and celebrated our cultural traditions, including superstitions, as a way of expressing our identity and acknowledging our roots. For us, these beliefs were never considered irrational, but rather an integral part of our cultural identity and a way of respecting our ancestors and their beliefs. One of the most significant superstitions that has been passed down in my family is the belief that the presence of a black cat is a bad omen. As a child, I believed in this superstition without realizing why we considered them unlucky. Later, I discovered that the superstition originates from the belief that black cats were associated with witches and evil spirits, and owning or encountering one was considered an invitation to danger. While today we do not equate black cats with witches, the superstition has remained a part of our cultural traditions and identity expression. Growing up, I also learned that specific rituals and beliefs were considered lucky, such as the presence of a horseshoe or a four-leaf clover. My grandmother would often gift us small charms and talismans to protect us from evil spirits, such as evil eye pendants, which are traditionally believed to protect against jealousy and envy. I remember wearing these charms as a child, feeling a sense of warmth and protection that came from knowing that I was carrying a piece of my heritage with me at all times. As I grew older, I began to question the logic behind these beliefs. I struggled to reconcile my belief in science and rationality with my fascination with superstitions and traditions. However, I soon realized that my curiosity was not about debunking these beliefs but rather understanding their significance in the formation of our cultural identity. I began to explore the idea that superstitions and traditional beliefs are not just about luck, curses, or spells, but a way of expressing identity and acknowledging cultural heritage. For instance, in many Asian cultures, the number four is considered unlucky, and the number eight is considered lucky. This belief is rooted in the teachings of feng shui, an ancient Chinese philosophy that considers the arrangement of objects to influence the flow of energy, or chi, in an environment. While the science behind feng shui may be disputed, its influence on Chinese culture and identity expression cannot be ignored. Similarly, in the Hindu belief system, there is a tradition of tying a sacred thread, or a rakhi, around the wrist of one's sibling as a symbol of love and protection. This ritual is not just a superstition but a way of acknowledging the strong bond between siblings and their cultural identity. Through my exploration of superstitions and traditions, I came to realize that cultural identity expression is more than just superficial customs or beliefs; it is about honoring your heritage and acknowledging the beliefs and values that make you who you are. For me, superstitions have become a way of staying connected to my cultural roots while forging my identity as a global citizen. In conclusion, superstitions and traditions may be considered irrational or unscientific, but they are an essential part of our cultural identity and heritage. They provide us with a sense of belonging and a connection to the past while adapting to modern times. They are not just about luck or magic; they are about expressing who we are as individuals and as part of a larger cultural community. As I continue to navigate the complexities of the world, I am grateful for the lessons that superstitions have taught me about the value of tradition and identity expression.",0,2.848077068,3.162065793,3.269904665,3.628653438,3.231267851,18.2,22.2,25.8,31.0,24.0
C1,399,"As I embark on the next chapter of my academic journey, I hope to bring this understanding of cultural identity and traditions to my college community. As someone who has learned to appreciate the significance of superstitions, I am eager to explore different cultures and belief systems beyond my own. I am also excited to contribute my perspectives on identity and culture to the college community. At a time when cultural and racial identity issues are at the forefront of public discussion, it's crucial to have an informed and inclusive discourse that respects and acknowledges different perspectives. I believe that bringing a diverse range of perspectives and experiences to the table can enrich the learning and living environment at any college. In addition, I am also passionate about pursuing academic excellence and intellectual curiosity. I believe that these qualities are essential to making meaningful contributions to society and igniting positive change. Whether I'm studying mathematics, biology, or philosophy, I approach my studies with the same level of curiosity and passion, seeking to push the boundaries of my knowledge and understanding. Ultimately, my goal is to use the opportunities presented to me at college to explore new frontiers of knowledge and contribute to the betterment of society. I am confident that my unique perspectives and experiences, coupled with a dedication to academic excellence, will enable me to make an impact in whatever path I choose to pursue. As I conclude my college application essay, I am reminded of a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson: 'Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.' I am excited to embark on this new journey, eager to carve out a path that brings together my passions for cultural identity, academic excellence, and positive change.",0,3.120557797,3.387544635,3.4842524,3.595549682,3.433328777,18.4,24.8,27.2,29.8,26.0
C2,400,"As I sit on the porch swing of my childhood home, I am transported back to a hot summer day when I was eight years old. My grandmother, who was always full of stories and superstitions, taught me a trick to make the swings go higher. She said if I closed my eyes, I could hear the whispers of the wind, telling me how to swing higher than the treetops. I remember feeling the warmth of the sun on my skin, the creaking of the ropes as I swung back and forth, and the sound of the leaves rustling in the wind. That moment taught me the importance of sensory experience and how it can transport us to another time and place. It also taught me that sometimes, the answers we seek are not always visible or tangible, but rather a feeling, a sensation. This lesson has stayed with me and has influenced my approach to learning and understanding the world around me. As I reflect on my experiences, I realize that my passion for learning and exploring different cultures and beliefs has been shaped by my family's traditions and experiences. Growing up in a household where my parents were immigrants from different parts of the world, I learned to appreciate and celebrate the diversity of cultures and traditions. My family's stories, beliefs, and customs have taught me that there is beauty in differences and that embracing diversity can lead to new ways of thinking and understanding. One particular tradition that has stuck with me is my father's obsession with astrology. For him, astrology serves as a tool for understanding oneself and the world around us. Growing up, I remember watching him consult his astrology chart before making any big decisions, and I was fascinated by how this ancient practice could offer insight into one's life. Although I don't subscribe to astrology in the same way as my father, I appreciate the way it has influenced my own understanding of identity and self-discovery. This appreciation for diversity and understanding has also shaped my academic pursuits. In high school, I challenged myself to take courses in different subjects, from computer science to anthropology, to gain a broader understanding of the world. In my senior year, I took an elective course on African American literature, which opened my eyes to the ways in which literature can be a powerful tool for social activism and change. One particular book that stood out to me was 'Their Eyes Were Watching God' by Zora Neale Hurston. Through the protagonist, Janie, I saw the struggles and triumphs of the black female experience and was forced to confront my own prejudices and biases. This experience solidified my desire to pursue a college education that would challenge my worldview and offer new perspectives. My passion for learning and my appreciation for diversity and understanding are what make me a strong candidate for Yale or Harvard. I am not merely seeking to accumulate knowledge and credentials, but rather to engage with a community that values inclusivity, intellectual curiosity, and social change. I look forward to contributing my unique perspectives and experiences to the college community and pursuing academic excellence that will allow me to make a positive impact in the world.",0,2.958370696,3.215278624,3.348614536,3.559748451,3.326514618,19.0,22.0,25.2,28.0,25.0
H,401,"Garishly lined with a pearlescent lavender, my eyes idly scanned the haphazard desk in front of me, settling on a small kohl. I packed the ebony powder into my waterline with a shaky hand, wincing at the fine specks making their way into my eyes. The palette's colors bore in, the breadth of my imagination interwoven into now-brittle brushes. The girl in the mirror seemed sharper, older, somehow. At only 12, I was relatively new to the powders and blushes that lined my birthday makeup kit, but I was determined to decipher the deep splashes of color that had for so long been an enigma to me. After school involved self-inflicted solitary confinement, as I shut myself in my bedroom to hone my skills. The palette’s colors bore in, the breadth of my imagination interwoven into now-brittle brushes. Much to my chagrin, my mom walked in one day, amused at my smudged lipstick, which congealed on the wispy hairs that lined my upper lip. “Halloween already?” she asked playfully. I flushed in embarrassment as she got to work, smoothing my skin with a brush and filling the gaps in my squiggly liner. Becoming a makeup aficionado was going to take some help. “What’s this even made of?” I asked, transfixed by the bright powder she was smattering on my cheeks. “You know, I’m not sure,” she murmured. “Maybe you should find out.” I did. Hours down the internet rabbit hole, I learned that the shimmery powder was made of mica, a mineral commonly used in cosmetics. While the substance was dazzling, its production process was steeped in humanitarian violations and environmental damage. Determined to reconcile my burgeoning love for makeup with my core values, I flung the kit into the corner of my drawer, vowing to find a more sustainable alternative. Yes, I was every bit as dramatic as you imagine it. Now 17, I approach ethical makeup with assured deliberation. As I glance at my dusty kit, which still sits where I left it, I harken back on the journey it has taken me on. Without the reckoning that it spurred, makeup would still simply be a tool of physical transformation, rather than a catalyst of personal growth. Now, each swipe of eyeliner is a stroke of my pen across paper as I write a children’s book about conscious consumerism. My flitting fingers programmatically place sparkles, mattes, and tints across my face in the same way that they feverishly move across a keyboard, watching algorithms and graphs integrate into models of supply chain transparency. Makeup has taught me to be unflinching, both in self expression and my expectations for the future. I coat my lips with a bold sheen, preparing them to form words of unequivocal urgency at global conferences and casual discussions. I see my passion take flight, emboldening others to approach their own reckonings, uncomfortable as they may be. I embark on a two-year journey of not buying new clothes in a statement against mass consumption and rally youth into a unified organization. We stand together, picking at the gritty knots of makeup, corporate accountability, and sustainability as they slowly unravel. I’m not sure why makeup transfixes me. Perhaps it’s because I enjoy seeing my reveries take shape. Yukta, the wannabe Wicked Witch of the West, has lids coated with emerald luster and lips of coal. Yukta, the Indian classical dancer, wields thick eyeliner and bright crimson lipstick that allow her expressions to be amplified across a stage. Deep rooted journeys of triumph and tribulation are plastered across the surface of my skin — this paradox excites me. Perhaps I am also drawn to makeup because as I peel back the layers, I am still wholly me. I am still the young girl staring wide-eyed at her reflection, earnestly questioning in an attempt to learn more about the world. Most importantly, I still carry an unflagging vigor to coalesce creativity and activism into palpable change, one brushstroke at a time.",1,2.421843203,2.888798063,3.115361946,3.373175811,3.053846042,10.0,18.0,22.0,23.0,18.5
C0,402,"It was a brisk summer evening when I made the decision that would change my ethical makeup forever. I was walking home from my part-time job when I spotted a wallet on the ground. Without thinking, I picked it up and opened it to check for identification. It belonged to a man named John Smith, and it had his driver's license and a large amount of cash inside. My initial excitement at the prospect of finding some extra money was swiftly overridden by a gnawing guilt. I knew that if I kept the wallet, I would be doing something wrong. Yet, if I handed it in, it would essentially be my good deed for the day. I felt torn between these two choices, but in the end, my desire to do the right thing prevailed, and I turned the wallet into the police station. This incident may seem small, but it was significant in my journey towards developing a sound ethical foundation. It was a moment where I put my values into action, and it helped me to realize the importance of doing what is right, even when it may be difficult or inconvenient. Over the years, my emphasis on honesty, integrity, and empathy has grown, and my pursuit of ethical leadership has become a core part of who I am today. Growing up, I was fortunate to have parents who instilled these values in me from an early age. They taught me the importance of treating others with respect, being truthful, and thinking about the consequences of my actions before acting on them. However, despite their guidance, I found that as I entered my teenage years, my ethical compass began to waver. I became more influenced by societal pressures and the desire to fit in with my peers. In the face of negative attitudes and behaviors around me, it was easy to become disillusioned and start questioning my own beliefs. Throughout high school, I became increasingly conscious of the ethical standards that existed within the community. I witnessed countless examples of individuals ostracized for their sexuality or held to unrealistic beauty standards. I experienced pressure to engage in behaviors such as cheating on tests or bullying others. Although I never lost sight of my own values, it was easy to feel overwhelmed by the demands of those around me. It was only after the incident with the wallet that I realized the importance of staying true to my values, even when it may be uncomfortable or unpopular. It was not easy to turn over the wallet, but I knew that doing so was the right decision. From that point on, I began to embrace the challenges that came with ethical leadership. I joined the leadership team for a club that focused on promoting acceptance and inclusion within our school, and I made an effort to speak out when I saw individuals being treated unfairly. I also sought out programming and volunteer opportunities that aligned with my values, such as a local homeless shelter and a peer tutoring program for underprivileged students. As I entered my senior year, my ethics were put to the test once again. I was nominated for a prestigious academic award, but upon learning that another student had also been nominated, I realized that I had unintentionally plagiarized some information in my application. It would have been easy to hide this, as I knew the chances of being caught were slim. However, I knew that doing so would be dishonest and would not align with my values. After consulting with my counselor, I made the decision to alert the award committee of my mistake and withdraw my nomination. Although this was a difficult decision, it was one that I knew was right, and it ultimately reinforced my commitment to integrity. In conclusion, my journey to develop a strong ethical makeup has been one of growing awareness, reflection, and action. It has led me to embrace values such as honesty, integrity, and empathy, and to seek out opportunities that allow me to put these values into practice. I am proud of the person I have become, and I hope to continue pursuing ethical leadership throughout my life. Ultimately, I believe that the decisions we make, and the values we uphold, are what determine who we are and who we will become.",0,2.616293174,2.817788717,2.980723851,3.169980784,2.882552899,16.0,18.0,21.0,27.0,19.0
C1,403,"As a high school senior, I've come to the realization that the world around us is rapidly changing, and it's my responsibility as a conscious citizen to take the necessary steps to make the planet a better place for all. For me, makeup has been an outlet of creative expression, and as I've navigated the world of cosmetics, I've realized the negative impact of unsustainable makeup consumption. While makeup is perceived as superficial, it's important to understand how our choices affect the environment and the people making these products. The cosmetic industry, which generates high profit margins by meeting growing demand, entails hazardous amounts of waste in the form of non-recyclable material that can degrade the environment, contaminate waterways, and harm wildlife ecosystems. Workers, mostly young women in low-income markets, face exploitation through unfair wages, unsafe working conditions, and lack of human rights. As I've delved deeper into ethical consumerism, I found that small changes can make a significant impact. Investing in reusable items like biodegradable cotton swabs, cotton makeup wipes, and refillable containers can cut down on wastage, while supporting eco-friendly makeup brands that prioritize sustainable ingredients, PVC-free packaging, and ethical labor practices, is an excellent way to shift towards sustainable beauty. Sustainable makeup doesn't compromise quality, nor does it have to compromise creative expression. Eco-friendly, vegan, and natural makeup is now a significant part of many makeup brands' product line, providing options that can be guilt-free, nourishing, and beneficial for both the environment and the users. Similarly, makeup can serve as a tool for promoting conscious consumption through subverting consumer culture, environmental advocacy, and activism. My journey to sustainable and ethical beauty started with creative expression. As I honed my makeup skills, I realized that my habits weren't sustainable, and I took it upon myself to change my consumption patterns. Switching to cruelty-free makeup brands, investing in alternative makeup tools, and supporting eco-friendly products was, and still is, a crucial part of my makeup journey. As part of this journey, I've come to appreciate the power of conscious consumerism, and how making small changes can make a significant impact in promoting an eco-friendly and ethical lifestyle. Change starts with individual action, and as active consumers, we hold the power to make a difference. As a high school senior, I'm excited for the prospect of creating real change, and makeup has been a catalyst for my journey towards sustainability. I understand that sustainable makeup is just a small part of the larger environmental crisis that we face, but it's a great starting point to foster a mindful and sustainable lifestyle. In conclusion, makeup and sustainability might seem like an unlikely match, but it's through prioritizing sustainable practices that the cosmetic industry can achieve necessary change to protect the environment, promote ethical labor practices, and foster activist mentality within beauty. By supporting and investing in eco-friendly makeup brands and shifting towards sustainable makeup practices, we can all contribute towards a more sustainable future.",0,2.856121073,3.332901578,3.429783413,3.790515295,3.39813178,18.2,23.2,26.6,32.8,25.0
C2,404,"The art of perfecting your makeup technique is like embarking on a transformative journey. The journey starts with understanding the purpose behind makeup, which is to highlight your features and enhance your natural beauty. However, the world of makeup can be superficial, with an excess of glitter and glitz, which often overshadows the real issues surrounding the cosmetic industry. Once you scratch the surface and understand the reality of unsustainable makeup practices, it's impossible to turn a blind eye. The cosmetic industry is notorious for hazardous amounts of waste, unfair labor practices, and the usage of harmful chemicals in their products. These practices don't just impact the environment; they affect the workers who create these products and those who use them. As I entered the world of sustainable makeup, I found my passion for creativity that went beyond trying new trends and transforming myself into different characters. Sustainable makeup opened my eyes to the larger picture, and I understood the importance of making conscious choices that aligned with my values. It's easy to get lost in the multitude of options available in the cosmetic industry. The packaging, the scents, and the colors are all engineered to capture your attention and lure you into their beauty. However, it's crucial to delve past the glitz and focus on the realities of the manufacturing process. The plastic packaging of makeup alone contributes to a considerable portion of waste that is non-recyclable, and as it degrades, it contaminates water and causes harm to wildlife. The workers who create these products are mainly young women from low-income markets who earn unjust wages, have no security in their jobs, and their health is at risk because of the harmful chemicals used in these products. As I evaluated my makeup routine, the realization of the damage it could cause to the environment and those who create it was enough to push me into sustainable makeup practices. I transitioned to using natural makeup that comprises eco-friendly ingredients, and packaging that is recyclable or reusable. For instance, instead of using disposable makeup wipes, I bought reusable makeup washcloths that were gentle on my skin and the environment. Additionally, I switched to natural cotton swabs that were compostable, further reducing my carbon footprint. The switch to sustainable makeup practices, while a small change, has had a profound impact on my life. With sustainable, ethically made makeup, I feel confident, empowered and free to express myself creatively. It's given me the confidence to approach issues more authentically and inspires me to seek out eco-conscious brands, who commit to fair labor practices. Adopting sustainable makeup practices meant that my choices aligned with my values, and I wasn't participating in any abusive industries that profit from exploitation. I found freedom in expressing my creative flair that supported the planet and the people who create these beautiful products. I believe that sustainable makeup habits can inspire change, not just in the cosmetic industry but in society as a whole. Conscious consumerism is the key to a greener future, and it starts with making small changes in our daily lives. If we all take steps towards ethical practices, we can make a massive impact and ensure that our planet remains beautiful for future generations. In conclusion, sustainable makeup is an essential part of my life, and while it doesn't solve all the issues surrounding the cosmetic industry's unsustainability, it's still a step in the right direction. It's taught me the importance of being a responsible consumer, one who values environment-friendly products made by ethical brands that work to create a positive impact. The world of sustainable makeup practices represents a fundamental shift in how we approach responsible consumerism. It provides us with a powerful tool to promote eco-friendly practices that minimize our environmental impact and support ethical labor practices. Sustainable makeup practices are not just limited to the cosmetic industry but can extend into other areas of our lives, creating a tidal wave of positive change. Through sustainable makeup, I've found a way to align my values with my actions, ensuring that a change in the world starts with me. This journey has taught me that sustainability and responsible consumerism are not just buzzwords, but a philosophy and a lifestyle choice that positively impacts our environment, society and does so much good for our future.",0,2.911514106,3.007458196,3.245873898,3.372130239,3.162679328,17.2,20.0,23.6,26.0,21.5
H,405,"Gazing up at the starry sky, I see Cygnus, Hercules, and Pisces, remnants of past cultures. I listen to waves crash on the beach, the forces of nature at work. Isn’t it odd how stars are flaming spheres and electrical impulses make beings sentient? The very existence of our world is a wonder; what are the odds that this particular planet developed all the necessary components, parts that all work in unison, to support life? How do they interact? How did they come to be? I thought back to how my previously simplistic mind-set evolved this past year. At Balboa, juniors and seniors join one of five small learning communities, which are integrated into the curriculum. Near the end of sophomore year, I ranked my choices: Law Academy first—it seemed the most prestigious—and WALC, the Wilderness Arts and Literacy Collaborative, fourth. So when I was sorted into WALC, I felt disappointed at the inflexibility of my schedule and bitter toward my classes. However, since students are required to wait at least a semester before switching pathways, I stayed in WALC. My experiences that semester began shifting my ambition-oriented paradigm to an interest-oriented one. I didn’t switch out. Beyond its integrated classes, WALC takes its students on trips to natural areas not only to build community among its students, but also to explore complex natural processes and humanity’s role in them. Piecing these lessons together, I create an image of our universe. I can visualize the carving of glacial valleys, the creation and gradation of mountains by uplift and weathering, and the transportation of nutrients to and from ecosystems by rivers and salmon. I see these forces on the surface of a tiny planet rotating on its axis and orbiting the sun, a gem in this vast universe. Through WALC, I have gained an intimate understanding of natural systems and an addiction to understanding the deep interconnections embedded in our cosmos. Understanding a system’s complex mechanics not only satisfies my curiosity, but also adds beauty to my world; my understanding of tectonic and gradational forces allows me to appreciate mountains and coastlines beyond aesthetics. By physically going to the place described in WALC’s lessons, I have not only gained the tools to admire these systems, but have also learned to actually appreciate them. This creates a thirst to see more beauty in a world that’s filled with poverty and violence, and a hunger for knowledge to satisfy that thirst. There are so many different systems to examine and dissect—science alone has universal, planetary, molecular, atomic, and subatomic scales to investigate. I hope to be able to find my interests by taking a variety of courses in college, and further humanity’s understanding through research, so that all can derive a deeper appreciation for the complex systems that govern this universe.",1,2.670132214,3.060805945,3.310102598,3.684030033,3.136338547,13.0,17.6,23.4,30.2,21.0
C0,406,"As I walk through the trails of my local park, I am constantly inspired by the interconnected beauty of natural systems. The leaves rustling in the wind, the tall trees providing shade, and the babbling brook flowing through it all - it is all a reminder that everything in nature is connected. This connection within natural systems is not only beautiful, but crucial to our survival. My passion for finding beauty in natural systems has not only been a personal source of inspiration, but a pathway to better understand our world and protect it for future generations. The beauty of natural systems is not always immediately apparent. It often requires careful observation and an open mind. For me, it started with birdwatching. As a child, I was fascinated by the bird’s ability to fly and effortlessly navigate through the trees. However, as I started to learn more about bird behavior, I realized there was something much deeper happening. The birds were just one small piece of an interconnected puzzle, playing a unique role in the ecosystem around them. The interconnectedness of nature doesn’t stop with birds. As I began to study more about the natural world, I was amazed at how everything works together. From small insects pollinating flowers to the large predators that roam the forests, each species plays a critical role in the balance of the ecosystem. Even the smallest disruption can cause a cascade of effects, leading to a breakdown in the natural systems we rely on. As I began to understand the intricacies of these natural systems, I became increasingly concerned about how human activity is affecting them. Pollution, habitat destruction, and climate change pose a very real threat to the world we live in. These issues can be overwhelming and daunting, but finding beauty in natural systems has given me a sense of hope and purpose. One example of this hope is the story of the gray wolf reintroduction in Yellowstone National Park. In the early 1900s, wolves were hunted to extinction in the park. This had a ripple effect on the ecosystem, as the elk population got out of control and started grazing in areas where they wouldn’t normally. This led to soil erosion, which drastically impacted the vegetation and river ecosystems. In 1995, wolves were reintroduced to the park, and their presence had a tremendous positive impact on the natural systems. The elk population stabilized, which allowed the vegetation to grow back, stabilizing soil, which in turn improved the river ecosystems. The reintroduction of the wolves was a reminder of the beauty of natural systems and how even small changes can make a big difference. As I embark on my journey to college, I know that studying these natural systems will help me understand how to create a more sustainable future. In my future studies, I want to learn about the ways in which human sustainability can be improved without negatively impacting the natural systems around us. How can we create more sustainable cities that bring people closer to nature? Can we find ways to restore damaged ecosystems, and what new technologies are available to facilitate this? These questions are essential for our continued survival, and I believe that finding beauty in natural systems gives us a roadmap to answer them. Nature has the exceptional ability to awe and inspire, a characteristic that is often overlooked in our modern lives as we increasingly become preoccupied with technology and material success. The beauty I find in natural systems reminds me that I am a part of something much greater than myself, and inspires me to make choices that positively impact the world around me. Ultimately, finding beauty in natural systems is not just a personal pursuit but essential to our continued existence. The delicate balance of these systems ensures that we have clean water to drink, air to breathe, and food to eat. The same systems that produce such beauty also produce the resources we need to survive, and it is our responsibility to protect them for future generations. As I reflect on my journey of finding beauty in natural systems, I am reminded that the world around us is full of wonder, mystery, and awe. Even the simplest of interactions, such as watching a butterfly pollinate a flower, can be a reminder of the deep interconnectedness of our world. My hope is that more people will find inspiration in the natural world, allowing them to better understand and protect the beauty that surrounds us. Ultimately, it is through these connections to nature that we will be able to create a more sustainable world for ourselves and future generations.",0,2.714531062,3.001485517,3.103695958,3.29019935,3.048615713,15.2,19.6,22.4,25.6,21.0
C1,407,"As I sit on the edge of the dock, dangling my feet into the cool water of the lake, I am struck by the beauty and fragility of the natural world. The soft rippling of the water and the chirping of the crickets create a symphony of sounds that fills the night air. The stars twinkle above me, each one a symbol of the infinite complexity of the universe. As I gaze out into the distance, I am reminded of my passion for environmental science and my desire to make a positive impact on the world we share. One of the experiences that has shaped my interests in environmental science was a hiking trip I took with my family to Yosemite National Park. The towering granite cliffs and rushing waterfalls were magnificent, but what struck me even more was the delicate balance that existed between the ecosystem and the human activities that impacted it. The signs warning visitors of the effects of littering and the strict guidelines for hiking and camping made me realize that we have a responsibility to protect the natural world for future generations. This experience sparked my interest in studying environmental science and the interconnections between natural systems. In high school, I immersed myself in science courses, taking advanced courses in biology, chemistry, and physics. I was especially drawn to ecology, where I learned about the vital role that each organism plays in the ecosystem and the importance of preserving biodiversity. Outside of the classroom, I took every opportunity to get involved in environmental causes. I volunteered at a local nature reserve to carry out field surveys of migratory bird populations and worked with the local community to organize a beach cleanup campaign. These experiences deepened my understanding of the challenges facing the natural world and motivated me to take action. As I prepare to apply to top-tier universities, such as Harvard and Yale, I feel confident that my experiences and passions make me a strong candidate. I believe that these institutions offer the academic rigor, interdisciplinary approach, and dynamic student communities that would challenge and inspire me to achieve my goals. In college, I hope to engage in research that explores the impacts of human activities on natural systems and identifies strategies for mitigating these impacts. One research project that particularly fascinates me is the study of the effects of climate change on biodiversity. I believe that by understanding the mechanisms that allow species to adapt to changing environmental conditions, we can identify ways to help them survive in the face of this crisis. Beyond academic pursuits, I look forward to exploring the natural world through travel and outdoor activities. There is no substitute for direct experience when it comes to understanding complex natural systems, and there is no shortage of wonders to explore. Whether I am studying marine ecosystems on a research vessel or camping in a national park, I know that each experience will deepen my understanding of the natural world and inspire me to work to preserve it. My ultimate goal is to use my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact on the world. Whether I work in government, non-profit organizations, or private industry, I believe that there are many opportunities to apply my understanding of environmental science to benefit both society and the environment. In particular, I am interested in working on the development of sustainable energy sources and the restoration of degraded ecosystems. As I gaze up at the stars, I know that I am part of a grand tradition of scientific inquiry that seeks to uncover the mysteries of the natural world. With the support of a world-class educational institution like Harvard or Yale, I am excited to contribute to this tradition and make meaningful contributions to society and the environment.",0,3.089018098,3.174507674,3.426199707,3.693552031,3.319738316,18.0,24.0,26.0,30.0,25.0
C2,408,"The morning breeze was refreshing and cool as I set out for a walk. The sun peeked through the trees, and the leaves rustled softly as I passed, letting in streams of light. The trail was unmarked, but the map in my pocket kept me on course as I wound my way through the lush forest. The scent of pine needles was strong, and I inhaled deeply, enjoying the fresh aroma. As I continued my walk, I noticed a humming sound getting louder and louder. I approached softly and witnessed dozens of bees buzzing around a group of flowers off the trail. They flew from flower to flower, collecting nectar and pollen before moving on to the next. I watched in amazement at their synchronized activity -- it was as though they were part of a swarm, each working to achieve a shared goal. This experience inspired me to learn more about pollinators and their important role in the environment. I researched studies about the decline of bees and other pollinators and realized that if we don't act soon, their decline could lead to devastating impacts on our food system and the natural world. Through my studies of environmental science, I hope to learn about ways humans can mitigate the impacts of climate change, including those on pollinators. I believe that we must all take action to ensure that our natural systems remain in balance and that future generations can enjoy the beauty of our planet. To me, the bee swarm was a symbol of resilience and cooperation in nature -- the bees worked together to collect the nectar and grow the plants, just as humans should work together to protect and sustain natural systems. I hope that in the future, I will be able to contribute to protecting these systems and making a positive difference in the world. In the same way that the bees work to achieve collective goals, I believe that humans must work together to address the challenges of climate change and protect the natural systems that sustain us. We must reduce our carbon footprint, promote renewable energy, and support policies that protect the environment. These actions are critical to ensuring a sustainable future for ourselves and future generations. Our planet is full of intricate and interconnected natural systems, and it is our responsibility to cherish and sustain them. We must find and share joy in the beauty of nature, just as we find joy in the beauty of our own lives.

H,409,"My Ye-Ye always wears a red baseball cap. I think he likes the vivid color—bright and sanguine, like himself. When Ye-Ye came from China to visit us seven years ago, he brought his red cap with him and every night for six months, it sat on the stairway railing post of my house, waiting to be loyally placed back on Ye-Ye’s head the next morning. He wore the cap everywhere: around the house, where he performed magic tricks with it to make my little brother laugh; to the corner store, where he bought me popsicles before using his hat to wipe the beads of summer sweat off my neck. Today whenever I see a red hat, I think of my Ye-Ye and his baseball cap, and I smile. Ye-Ye is the Mandarin word for “grandfather.” My Ye-Ye is a simple, ordinary person—not rich, not “successful”—but he is my greatest source of inspiration and I idolize him. Of all the people I know, Ye-Ye has encountered the most hardship and of all the people I know, Ye-Ye is the most joyful. That these two aspects can coexist in one individual is, in my mind, truly remarkable. Ye-Ye was an orphan. Both his parents died before he was six years old, leaving him and his older brother with no home and no family. When other children gathered to read around stoves at school, Ye-Ye and his brother walked in the bitter cold along railroad tracks, looking for used coal to sell. When other children ran home to loving parents, Ye-Ye and his brother walked along the streets looking for somewhere to sleep. Eight years later, Ye-Ye walked alone—his brother was dead. Ye-Ye managed to survive, and in the meanwhile taught himself to read, write, and do arithmetic. Life was a blessing, he told those around him with a smile. Years later, Ye-Ye’s job sent him to the Gobi Desert, where he and his fellow workers labored for twelve hours a day. The desert wind was merciless; it would snatch their tent in the middle of the night and leave them without supply the next morning. Every year, harsh weather took the lives of some fellow workers. After eight years, Ye-Ye was transferred back to the city where his wife lay sick in bed. At the end of a twelve-hour workday, Ye-Ye took care of his sick wife and three young children. He sat with the children and told them about the wide, starry desert sky and mysterious desert lives. Life was a blessing, he told them with a smile. But life was not easy; there was barely enough money to keep the family from starving. Yet, my dad and his sisters loved going with Ye-Ye to the market. He would buy them little luxuries that their mother would never indulge them in: a small bag of sunflower seeds for two cents, a candy each for three cents. Luxuries as they were, Ye-Ye bought them without hesitation. Anything that could put a smile on the children’s faces and a skip in their steps was priceless. Ye-Ye still goes to the market today. At the age of seventy-eight, he bikes several kilometers each week to buy bags of fresh fruits and vegetables, and then bikes home to share them with his neighbors. He keeps a small patch of strawberries and an apricot tree. When the fruit is ripe, he opens his gate and invites all the children in to pick and eat. He is Ye-Ye to every child in the neighborhood. I had always thought that I was sensible and self-aware. But nothing has made me stare as hard in the mirror as I did after learning about the cruel past that Ye-Ye had suffered and the cheerful attitude he had kept throughout those years. I thought back to all the times when I had gotten upset. My mom forgot to pick me up from the bus station. My computer crashed the day before an assignment was due. They seemed so trivial and childish, and I felt deeply ashamed of myself. Now, whenever I encounter an obstacle that seems overwhelming, I think of Ye-Ye; I see him in his red baseball cap, smiling at me. Like a splash of cool water, his smile rouses me from grief, and reminds me how trivial my worries are and how generous life has been. Today I keep a red baseball cap at the railing post at home where Ye-Ye used to put his every night. Whenever I see the cap, I think of my Ye-Ye, smiling in his red baseball cap, and I smile. Yes, Ye-Ye. Life is a blessing.",1,2.389225734,2.638222198,2.957984715,3.205726371,2.900832321,10.0,13.0,18.8,24.0,16.5
C0,410,"As I lie on my bed, surrounded with posters of rock legends, I can't help but think about Ye-Ye, the French pop music of the 1960s. It may seem unusual to turn to such music for inspiration at a time like this when the world is changing rapidly, but for me, Ye-Ye represents a simpler, and more joyful time. Ye-Ye encompasses a unique and inspiring time in French history, one that came about during the post-World War II era when the country was recovering from the devastating effects of the war. As France began experiencing a boost in economic growth and cultural exchange, Ye-Ye emerged as a unique music genre, blending American and British influences with French chansons. Though its heyday was only a few years, Ye-Ye left an indelible mark on French history, inspiring countless generations. For me, Ye-Ye represents the boundless potential for joy, creativity, and unbridled passion. Having grown up in an era where consumerism and technology dominate, the simple joy that Ye-Ye musicians expressed is something that I believe is worth treasuring. I am inspired by the way Ye-Ye music conveys a sense of youthful enthusiasm and carefree abandon, and how they never shy away from showing their emotions. The way their music encourages the expression of feelings and promotes the idea that it's okay to have fun, no matter what other people say, is what makes it so emotionally impactful to me. In my life, I have faced many setbacks, but Ye-Ye music has been a constant source of inspiration for me. My love for rock music began when I was 12 years old. My father gave me my first guitar, and from then onwards, I developed a deep fascination with the music genre. However, as I delved deeper into the world of rock, I began to realize just how influential Ye-Ye was, serving as a precursor to the world of rock and establishing a new cultural touchstone in France, something that still resonates today. Although I cannot understand the French language, the music's upbeat rhythm, and the playful manner of its lyrics always make me happy. Whenever I listen to Francoise Hardy's 'Comment Te Dire Adieu,' I am soothed by the simple, melodic guitar hook, and how it complements Hardy's voice so perfectly. The straightforward lyrics convey the sense of inevitability of a nearing goodbye, making me feel as if Hardy is singing directly to me, and I relate to this on a personal level. Ye-Ye's music is universal, transcending the language barrier and letting us connect through our emotions. Ye-Ye's joyful influence extends beyond music, and to me, it represents a way of life. The music of Ye-Ye era was all about being carefree and open, living without inhibitions, and embracing creativity. Ye-Ye encourages people to take chances and chase their dreams. It speaks to the idea that we should all embrace our passions, and approach our lives with an attitude of joy, hope, and purposefulness. This year has been challenging for all of us, but Ye-Ye has maintained its power to soothe and uplift my spirits at a time when it's easy to feel overwhelmed. Listening to a cheerful Ye-Ye song immediately puts a smile on my face, reminding me that life is what we make of it, and that there's much to celebrate. As I prepare to leave high school behind, Ye-Ye remains an inspiration that I will carry with me into my future. I have always dreamed of attending either Yale or Harvard, not just because of their reputations, but because of the communities of students I can become a part of. These institutions are renowned and bring together talented, passionate and diverse individuals, which is all I could hope for in a college community. In many ways, Ye-Ye perfectly encapsulates everything that I hope to achieve, express and represent throughout my college years. My passion for music, for writing and for making a difference in communities is rooted in the carefree spirit and the sense of playful abandon that Ye-Ye embodies. I hope to take this sense of joy and apply it to my experiences throughout my college years and beyond. Ye-Ye serves as a reminder to me that life is worth living to the fullest, and that we should always find joy in the things that we love to do. Whether it's writing an essay, practicing a new song on the guitar, or building relationships with people, there's always something new to discover, and Ye-Ye encourages me to approach it with an open, and joyous heart. In conclusion, Ye-Ye has been a constant source of inspiration for me. Its music and carefree spirit remind me that life is a celebration to be enjoyed. I believe that being part of the Yale or Harvard community would be a stepping stone to achieving all that I hope for in life. It would offer me the opportunity to interact with passionate individuals from diverse backgrounds, immerse myself in new cultures, and achieve my aspirations. I am optimistic that I can leverage the opportunity of being a part of any of these institutions to pursue my passions, fulfill my dreams and create a positive impact in the world.",0,2.906245328,3.061268665,3.228243939,3.418222232,3.157232276,18.0,22.0,27.0,30.0,24.5

Like many people, I was once blind to the extent of the hardships and struggles that countless individuals experience. However, it was Ye-Ye's life story that opened my eyes to the world's capacity for cruelty and injustice. Born an orphan, Ye-Ye was left alone at a young age to fend for himself and his younger brother. The two boys walked in the bitter cold, collecting used coal to sell while other children read indoors. And when Ye-Ye's brother passed away, he walked on alone. Despite the obstacles that he faced, Ye-Ye possessed an unparalleled sense of optimism and perseverance. He taught himself to read, write, and do arithmetic, and he never let his hardships crush his spirit. During his work in the Gobi Desert, facing the desert wind's mercilessness that was responsible for the death of his fellow workers, Ye-Ye's optimism never faltered. And even with his long workday, he would come home to care for his ailing wife and three children with stories of the incredible world he saw through his eyes in the desert. Ye-Ye's life taught me a lesson that I would never forget: despite the overwhelming nature of some of life's obstacles, we must always maintain a spirit of positivity and a sense of perseverance. Life is not easy, and Ye-Ye's life illustrates that when faced with such challenges, it is easy to lose sight of the beautiful things life has to offer. Ye-Ye's kindness and generosity extended beyond his immediate family to his neighbors and all the children in his neighborhood. Even as a seventy-eight-year-old, Ye-Ye still went to the market and biked for kilometers, buying fresh produce for his neighbors to share. He never lost sight of what truly mattered in life: making other people happy. Today, as I keep Ye-Ye's red baseball cap at the railing post where he used to place it every night, I am reminded of how he lived. Ye-Ye's smile helps me through the tough times in my life, encouraging me to maintain a positive attitude and to see that life is a remarkable blessing. Ye-Ye's life story instilled in me a sense of empathy for those who struggle and helped me recognize that we must be resilient, kind, and optimistic.

C2,412,"I woke up to the sound of rain drumming against my window. The pitter-patter of the drops was soothing, but foreboding at the same time, signaling that it was time for another day spent in quarantine. As I sat up in bed, I caught a glimpse of Ye-Ye's red baseball cap out of the corner of my eye. The cap sat on the railing post of my balcony, where Ye-Ye always placed it every night before bed. Ye-Ye's cap was not only a simple accessory, it symbolized his unwavering optimism and resilience in the face of adversity, qualities that I found myself emulating during this quarantine period. As I picked up the cap and held it in my hands, I couldn't help but reminisce about the times when Ye-Ye wore it. I still remember the time when Ye-Ye's old neighborhood was hit by a typhoon. The winds howled violently, and the streets were filled with debris. Despite the chaos outside, Ye-Ye put on his red baseball cap and went about his day, doing what he could to restore the community. He helped clear the streets and ensured that those who were hurt received the medical attention they needed. Ye-Ye's unwavering kindness knew no bounds, and he never hesitated to help those in need. Through his actions, Ye-Ye taught me the importance of being resilient and staying positive despite the worst circumstances life can throw at us. During this quarantine period, staying positive has been a struggle for many of us. The pandemic has been a relentless force, causing us to lose touch with the things that made us happy. However, every time I hold Ye-Ye's red baseball cap in my hands, I remember that life is worth cherishing, with all its imperfections and challenges. Ye-Ye taught me to see the world with wonder, to appreciate even the simplest of things. As a child, I would spend my summers with Ye-Ye in his village. I remember walking through the small, idyllic community with Ye-Ye, listening to birds chirping and the sound of crickets filling the air. Ye-Ye would marvel at the beauty of nature and take in the scent of the flowers blooming all around us. Every day was an adventure with Ye-Ye, and every moment was a reminder to appreciate the world around us. As I sit here holding Ye-Ye's cap, a sudden sense of gratefulness washes over me.

H,413,"James was not fitting in with everyone else. During lunch, he sat alone, playing with his own toys. During group activities, the other campers always complained when paired with him. What was wrong? As camp counselor, I quietly observed his behavior—nothing out of the ordinary. I just couldn’t fathom why the other campers treated him like a pariah. After three days of ostracism, James broke down during a game of soccer. Tears streaming down his cheeks, he slumped off the field, head in his hands. I jogged toward him, my forehead creased with concern. Some campers loudly remarked, “Why is that creep crying?” Furious indignation leaped into my heart. They were the ones who “accidentally” bumped into him and called him “James the Freak.” It was their cruelty that caused his meltdown, and now they were mocking him for it. I sharply told them to keep their thoughts to themselves. I squatted beside James and asked him what was wrong. Grunting, he turned his back to me. I had to stop his tears, and I had to make him feel comfortable. So for the next hour, I talked about everything a seven-year-old boy might find interesting, from sports to Transformers. I had to stop his tears, and I had to make him feel comfortable. So for the next hour, I talked about everything a seven-year-old boy might find interesting, from sports to Transformers. “I have a question,” I asked as James began to warm to me. I took a deep breath and dove right into the problem. “Why do the other campers exclude you?” Hesitantly, he took off his shoes and socks, and pointed at his left foot. One, two, three … four. He had four toes. We had gone swimming two days before: All the campers must have noticed. I remembered my childhood, when even the smallest abnormality—a bad haircut, a missing tooth—could cause others, including myself, to shrink away. I finally understood. But what could I do to help? I scoured my mind for the words to settle his demons. But nothing came to me. Impulsively, I hugged him—a gesture of intimacy we camp leaders were encouraged not to initiate, and an act I later discovered no friend had ever offered James before. Then, I put my hand on his shoulder and looked him straight in the eyes. I assured him that external features didn’t matter, and that as long as he was friendly, people would eventually come around. I listed successful individuals who had not been hindered by their abnormalities. And finally, I told him he would always be my favorite camper, regardless of whether he had two, five, or a hundred toes. On the last day of camp, I was jubilant—James was starting to fit in. Although the teasing had not completely disappeared, James was speaking up and making friends. And when, as we were saying our good-byes, James gave me one last hug and proclaimed that I was his “bestest friend in the whole wide world,” my heart swelled up. From my campers, I learned that working with children is simply awesome. And from James, I learned that a little love truly goes a long way.",1,2.200266285,2.548434865,2.755152036,2.958552685,2.650732507,8.6,12.0,14.0,19.0,13.0
C0,414,"Growing up, I was the target of bullies. It seemed as though there was always someone who found a reason to pick on me, whether it was my clothes, my quiet demeanor, or just the fact that I seemed like an easy target. At the time, I felt isolated and alone. It was hard not to view myself as the problem, as though there was something inherently wrong with me that made me deserving of the constant ridicule. Despite the pain I felt from being bullied, I now look back on my experiences with a different perspective. I realize that, in many ways, these experiences shaped who I am today. In particular, they helped me to develop a greater sense of empathy for others, something that I believe is sorely lacking in our society. Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another person. It’s something that’s often talked about, but not always practiced. It’s easy to get caught up in our own concerns and forget that others have their own struggles and emotions that they’re dealing with. For me, bullying was an opportunity to develop empathy. It was a chance to see firsthand how hurtful words and actions can impact someone’s life. And it taught me to be more mindful of the way I treat others. When I see someone being bullied today, I feel a deep sense of empathy. I can’t help but imagine what that person must be feeling, and the impact that the bully’s words and actions are having on their life. There’s a sense of solidarity between those who have been bullied, a recognition that we’ve all been through difficult times and that we need to support each other. But empathy isn’t just something that’s important in the context of bullying. It’s something that’s crucial to creating a more just and compassionate society. If we can learn to put ourselves in the shoes of others, to understand their struggles and their fears, we can begin to build a world that is more just and equitable. Unfortunately, empathy is in short supply these days. We live in a world that often feels polarized and divided, where people are quick to judge and slow to listen. We’re bombarded with news that reminds us of all the ways in which people are different: different races, different cultures, different political beliefs. It can be easy to forget that, regardless of our differences, we all share a common humanity. And with that humanity comes a shared capacity for joy, pain, and love. One of the most important steps we can take towards fostering greater empathy is to listen to the stories of others. When we hear about someone else’s struggles and experiences, it’s easier to put ourselves in their shoes and to understand where they’re coming from. This is one of the reasons that I’m so passionate about storytelling. I believe that hearing others’ stories can help us to develop a greater sense of empathy and understanding, which can in turn bring us closer together as a society. As a creative writer, I’ve been lucky enough to have the opportunity to tell stories of my own. In my writing, I try to capture the experiences and emotions of people from all walks of life, whether they’re immigrants struggling to make a life in a new country or teenagers dealing with the challenges of growing up. It’s my hope that through my writing, I can help others to see the world through a different lens, to experience the world through someone else’s perspective. By cultivating greater empathy, we can break down barriers and create a more just and compassionate world. There’s no denying that being bullied is a painful experience. But for me, it was also an opportunity to develop greater empathy, to see the world through the eyes of someone who was hurting. And this empathy has continued to shape who I am today, both as a writer and as a person. As I embark on the next chapter of my life, I hope to carry this lesson with me: to always strive to understand the experiences of others, and to work towards building a more just and equitable society.",0,2.277908815,2.414239926,2.772421171,2.968340588,2.694299796,12.0,16.0,21.0,27.0,18.5
C1,415,"Every single one of us wants to fit in. Whether it’s in school or at work or in our social lives, we all have a deep desire to be accepted and loved by those around us. But what happens when someone is not fitting in, when their differences make them stand out in a negative way? James, a camper at a summer camp, was experiencing this firsthand. His four toes on one foot caused him to be ostracized by the other campers - a cruel reminder of how tough it can be to be different. It wasn’t until someone took the time to understand his behavior and learn about his differences that James was able to start to fit in. Like James, I too have experienced the pain of being singled out because of my differences. As the only male student in an all-girls school, I have had my fair share of bullying and name-calling. For a long time, I tried to hide the things that made me different, like my fashion sense and long hair. However, no matter how hard I tried to blend in, I was always the odd one out. It wasn’t until I started standing up for myself that things began to change. I started speaking confidently about my passions, my love for fashion, my desire to study hard, and why they were important to me. I was surprised to find that when I talked openly and honestly about my differences, classmates became more curious and interested in what I had to say. Over time, I realized that my classmates weren’t bullying me because they hated me, but because they didn’t understand me. I was the only male student they had ever met, and this made me different from everyone else. Although it didn’t justify their disrespectful behavior, it helped me to see things from their perspective. I began to take the initiative to reach out to my classmates and educate them on my differences, beliefs, and my passion for education. I found that once people understand and get to know each other, they are less likely to judge and make fun of each other. Soon my classmates saw me for who I was, and the bullying died down. Through my experience, I learned about the power of education and how it can help break down barriers of hate and intolerance. It opened up doors of understanding and gave me the confidence to be myself without fear of ridicule. I realized that the things that make us different are also the things that make us unique and special, and we should be proud of them. As I look toward my future and my college education, I hope to continue to learn about different cultures and ways of thinking. I want to use my education to create a more inclusive society, where everyone feels respected and valued. We are all unique and have something to offer, and it’s up to us to celebrate and embrace our differences. In conclusion, James's story showed how a little love and understanding can go a long way. By taking the initiative to reach out and learn about his differences, the camp counselor was able to help James start to fit in. And in doing so, he created a more accepting and inclusive community. Like James, I learned that standing up for myself and educating others on my differences not only helped me but also helped my classmates better understand me. I firmly believe that education is the key to acceptance and understanding, and it’s up to us to use it to create a more tolerant and empathetic society. It’s time to celebrate our differences and learn from each other. Together, we can build a better future for all.",0,2.496824824,2.684236107,2.843347894,2.990298042,2.723980665,14.4,18.0,21.6,24.8,20.0
C2,416,"Being different is not always easy. In fact, it can be downright painful. From James’s story at summer camp to my experience as the only male student in an all-girls school, standing out can make one a target for bullies and ridicule. As a teenager, I struggled to fit in with my classmates. I was not the typical teenage boy who played sports or watched movies all weekend. Instead, I loved to read and design clothes. My passion for fashion was something that made me stand out from everyone else, but it also made me the victim of bullying and name-calling. As time went by, I realized that the only way to stop the bullying was by being true to myself. I stood up for my beliefs and talked openly about my love of fashion. This was a turning point for me, as I was surprised by how many students were more curious and respectful once I talked about my interests. I have found that educating others about one's passions can create acceptance and understanding. When we speak openly and honestly about our differences, we allow others to see us as individuals, rather than simply what makes us different. Education has the power to break down barriers of hate and intolerance, and it is up to us to use it to create a more inclusive society. By celebrating our differences, we can unite and learn from each other, instead of tearing each other down. To create a more tolerant society, we need to learn from people like James, who faced challenges due to his differences. He was ostracized by other campers because he had four toes on one foot. However, things changed when a counselor took the time to learn about his differences. The counselor showed James that he was valued and cared for. His simple act of kindness created a ripple effect, as James felt more comfortable being himself and started to fit in with the other campers. This story demonstrates how little acts of kindness can make an enormous difference in the life of someone who feels like an outcast. It also exemplifies the power of education to create an inclusive and accepting community. As someone who has experienced bullying and intolerance, I believe that we all have the power to create a more inclusive society. It takes courage and empathy to stand up for ourselves and others. It also means taking the time to understand and learn about those who are different from ourselves. But most importantly, it means celebrating our differences and seeing them as strengths, rather than weaknesses. When we do this, we create a more tolerant and inclusive world where everyone feels welcome and respected. In conclusion, everyone has experienced being the “odd one out.” Some people find ways to fit in, while others struggle to do so. However, we can learn from these experiences and use them to create a more inclusive society, where everyone feels valued and respected. We must educate ourselves and others on our differences, and how they make us unique and special. We must actively listen to and show empathy for people who are different from us. We must be kind to others and stand up for people who are victimized. My experience and James's story show that we can create a better future for ourselves and future generations. We have the power to make a positive difference in someone's life by simply accepting and appreciating our differences. Let us embrace diversity and make it a part of our narrative. In doing so, we will create a more inclusive, empathetic, and equitable society for all.",0,2.480921145,2.603999472,2.793325707,2.923779097,2.671082085,13.6,15.0,18.0,23.0,17.0
H,417,"Finally, I had found a volunteer opportunity at the Long Marine Lab, a marine biology research facility at UC Santa Cruz! I envisioned swimming with dolphins, or perhaps studying behavioral patterns of decorator crabs. But when I discovered the nature of my work on the first day of volunteering, my excitement turned to disappointment: I’d be picking through albatross boluses, the indigestible materials they cough up before going to sea. Sure enough, after three hours of separating fishing line from brown muck, I began to dread what I was in for. At that point, I had no clue of just how interesting the opportunity would turn out to be, and it would remind me of how easily I become engrossed and fascinated by all sorts of random stuff. It didn’t take long for my boredom with the boluses to shift toward curiosity. In the first place, the project itself was fascinating. The idea was to research the behavior and diet of albatrosses at sea. These birds can fly for months without touching land! When the birds have chicks, they cough up whatever they’ve eaten at sea to feed their young. When the chicks become old enough to fly, they cough up the hard, indigestible materials left in their stomachs. These boluses contain squid beaks that can reveal the types of squid eaten and the area where the squid were caught. We volunteers would pick through the boluses, separating out anything that looked interesting. As I got better at dissecting these blobs, I started finding crazy stuff, and my colleagues and I would often discuss important findings. There was, of course, the search for the biggest squid beak, and the fish eyes were always interesting. But most shocking was the plastic. Beyond the normal Styrofoam and fishing line were plastic bottle caps, lighters, even toothbrushes. Occasionally, Asian writing revealed distant origins. Once, I picked through a bolus permeated with orange goo, eventually to discover the round mouthpiece of a balloon. The origins of these artifacts were sad, but also fascinating. I learned of the Texas-sized trash heap in the middle of the Pacific, the effects of which I was witnessing firsthand. I gained a heightened awareness of the damage inflicted on the oceans by humans, and their far-reaching impacts. Perhaps most importantly, I realized that even the most tedious things can blow my mind. If dissecting boluses can be so interesting, imagine the things I’ve yet to discover! I play piano and can see myself dedicating my life to the instrument, but I can’t bear to think of everything else I’d have to miss. I’d love to study albatrosses, but also particle physics or history, and preferably all three. At this point in my life, I can’t imagine picking just one area. At the same time, though, I love studying subjects in depth. I tend to get overwhelmed by my options, since I can’t possibly choose them all. But at least I know I’ll never be bored in life: there are just too many subjects to learn about, books to read, pieces to play, albatrosses to save, and boluses to dissect.",1,2.441178374,2.760834116,3.01406068,3.195026605,2.8433604,12.6,14.0,18.0,21.0,15.0
C0,418,"Volunteering is a way to give back to society, and it is an activity that has been widely encouraged in schools all over the world. Everyone in high school is doing it, and I decided to hop on the bandwagon for my volunteering activity. I wanted to do something different from the norm. I wanted a volunteering experience that would give me a different perspective, a unique experience that would broaden my horizons. I stumbled upon the Albatross Bolus program, and it quickly piqued my curiosity. I could not believe there were actual volunteer opportunities to help with the bolus process, where the boluses can show how much plastic litter the albatrosses have consumed. I was thrilled to be a part of the process, and I never imagined that the bolus activity would impact me the way it did. When I arrived at the Albatross Conservation Group, I was assigned to work on the bolus team, and I was quickly briefed on the entire process. Boluses are the indigestible remains of the food that the birds consume. The birds often mistake plastic for food, and when consumed, these plastics remain in their stomachs causing the birds to gradually decrease in weight until death. The boluses are a gruesome but necessary artifact that helps scientists understand the impact of microplastics on the avian world. The process of creating a bolus is intricate and starts with sifting through a mass of vomit-like material to find the plastics. It was a stomach-churning task, but I started to get used to it after a few days. After extracting the plastics, we sorted them according to color and size, and then the actual bolus was created by compressing these plastics until a paper-like artifact was created. This process lasted for hours but it was fascinating to know that these boluses would undergo chemical analysis to create a better understanding of the impact of plastics on these beautiful birds. Besides contributing to the research world, volunteering allowed me to learn more about the bird's habitat, the Ocean. The oceans reminded me of my place in the world, it sparked a deeper appreciation and understanding of how insignificant my problems really were compared to the vastness of the ocean. The blue hues and the sea breeze were an experience I could never forget. I learned how the albatrosses thrive in these habitats and the impact that humans have on their ecosystem. It exemplified the consequences of human actions on earth. Working with albatross boluses opened doors for me to think about the planet, its state, and the current impacts on its inhabitants. It made me realize that though our challenges seem trivial, it contributes to the larger issues. Our daily plastic usage contributes to the ocean and the animals that live within it. Volunteering with the bolus program was my way to say I am ready to make a change no matter how insignificant it appears. Volunteering with Albatross Boluses also had a knock-on effect on my personal growth. It reinforced the lessons I have learned throughout my high school career- the importance of teamwork, reliability, and consistency. It takes a village to make a bolus, and everyone on the team plays an integral role. We had to work together, and we had a system to get through the mountain of vomit-like material. We had to be able to rely on each other to ensure we extracted every piece of plastic, otherwise, the bolus wouldn't be accurate. This experience complements my personality type as I enjoy working with people in a team setting. It also taught me the importance of consistency, being dedicated to what you are doing, and having pride in the product when it's completed. Working with the Albatross Conservation Group exposed me to the importance of volunteerism and helped me develop a stronger sense of altruism. The program reaffirmed the quote, 'be the change you want to see in the world.' Seeing how plastics impact the well-being of these creatures opened my eyes to the bigger picture, and I vowed to make a difference. It highlighted how seemingly little things like volunteering with a bolus program can make a difference to the greater community. In conclusion, volunteering with the Albatross Bolus program changed my life. It was a unique experience that opened doors to a new avenue of thinking, it broadened my horizons, strengthened my character, and allowed me to impact the world positively.

C2,420,"As I walked along the shoreline, the waves crashing underfoot, I was struck by the vastness of the ocean. The salty mist stinging my face, I felt a sense of both wonder and sadness. The ocean was both beautiful and heartbreaking, a place of life and death. I couldn't help but think about the countless marine animals that called the ocean their home and the pollution that threatened their existence. It was during this time I learned about the impact of plastic pollution on marine life, particularly on albatross. As I researched more about these majestic birds, I discovered that up to 80% of albatross chicks have plastic in their boluses, regurgitated remains of their meals. It was a disturbing discovery that left a lasting impact on me. I decided to focus on environmental research and marine biology because I wanted to explore the intersection between science and environmentalism. I spent my summers working with advocacy organizations, where I learned that there was no one-size-fits-all solution to solving environmental problems. It was evident that the solution to plastic pollution and oceanic destruction would require a multi-faceted approach. Despite the dire nature of the environmental crisis, there are still glimmers of hope. On one occasion, I participated in a beach clean-up campaign that was sponsored by my school's environmental club. We spent hours picking up discarded trash, sorting through plastic, and other waste material that littered the beach. I was inspired by the camaraderie I felt with my fellow volunteers, and the numerous conversations we had about reducing plastic usage and educating others about the effects of littering. During this cleanup, I was struck by the multitude of plastic bottles, bags, and straws that had accumulated with the help of the wind and sea. The trash was not just an eyesore; it was a testament to the entire human footprint that has left a stain on the ocean. Amidst this overwhelming sight, I felt a sense of responsibility and ownership in contributing to change. In another experience volunteering with an advocacy organization, I learned that the key to enacting change was through collaboration and education. The organization was put together to bring tri-state communities together to better understand the complexities surrounding environmental policy and to find innovative solutions to the shared challenges posed by the crisis. I was honored to work on this initiative, learning about how environmentalists and scientists were re-thinking interactions between industry and state governments. This organization served as a platform for in-depth conversations that intersected corporate, scientific, and policy approaches to solving the environmental crisis. The environmental crisis that continues to face our ocean is immense and multifaceted, and requires constant attention and a commitment to individual responsibility. Indeed, individual responsibility and changing personal behaviors is the key to inspiring change in the long run, and it requires a deeper understanding of our world and our community. As I reflect on my high school career, I am filled with hope and determination to continue advocating for the ocean. Whether it's through field research or policy advocacy, I will work towards contributing to change through education and action. In conclusion, the survival of our oceans is essential to our collective well-being. The degradation of our oceans is not just for the sake of marine life but for ours as well. The solution to the environmental crisis is complex, and it takes inspiration and leadership from society's most talented students to spearhead efforts for a brighter future.

H,421,"I sat on my parents’ bed weeping with my head resting on my knees. “Why did you have to do that to me? Why did you have to show me the house and then take it away from me?” Hopelessly, I found myself praying to God realizing it was my last resort. For years, my family and I found ourselves moving from country to country in hopes of a better future. Factors, such as war and lack of academic opportunities, led my parents to pack their bags and embark on a new journey for our family around the world. Our arduous journey first began in Kuçovë, Albania, then Athens, Greece, and then eventually, Boston, Massachusetts. Throughout those years, although my family always had a roof over our heads, I never had a place I could call “home.” That night that I prayed to God, my mind raced back to the night I was clicking the delete button on my e-mails, but suddenly stopped when I came upon a listing of the house. It was September 22, 2007 —eight years exactly to the day that my family and I had moved to the United States. Instantly, I knew that it was fate that was bringing this house to me. I remembered visiting that yellow house the next day with my parents and falling in love with it. However, I also remembered the heartbreaking phone call I received later on that week saying that the owners had chosen another family’s offer. A week after I had prayed to God, I had given up any hopes of my family buying the house. One day after school, I unlocked the door to our one-bedroom apartment and walked over to the telephone only to see it flashing a red light. I clicked PLAY and unexpectedly heard the voice of our real estate agent. “Eda!” she said joyfully. “The deal fell through with the other family—the house is yours! Call me back immediately to get started on the papers.” For a moment, I stood agape and kept replaying the words in my head. Was this really happening to me? Was my dream of owning a home finally coming true? Over the month of November, I spent my days going to school and immediately rushing home to make phone calls. Although my parents were not fluent enough in English to communicate with the bank and real estate agent, I knew that I was not going to allow this obstacle to hinder my dream of helping to purchase a home for my family. Thus, unlike a typical thirteen-year-old girl’s conversations, my phone calls did not involve the mention of makeup, shoes, or boys. Instead, my conversations were composed of terms, such as “fixed-rate mortgages,” “preapprovals,” and “down payments.” Nevertheless, I was determined to help purchase this home after thirteen years of feeling embarrassed from living in a one-bedroom apartment. No longer was I going to experience feelings of humiliation from not being able to host sleepovers with my friends or from not being able to gossip with girls in school about who had the prettiest room color. I had been homeless for the first thirteen years of my life. Although I will never be able to fully repay my parents for all of their sacrifices, the least I could do was to help find them a home that they could call their own—and that year, I did. To me, a home means more than the general conception of “four walls and a roof.” A home is a place filled with memories and laughter from my family. No matter where my future may lead me, I know that if at times I feel alone, I will always have a yellow home with my family inside waiting for me.",1,2.552053305,2.976272401,3.106080458,3.426204185,2.994071546,12.4,18.8,23.2,30.2,20.0
C0,422,"As a child, I moved around a lot. I lived in five different states before I turned ten, and each time we moved, it felt like we were starting over. But no matter where we lived, my parents always dreamed of owning a home. They wanted a place where we could put down roots, stay for more than a year or two, and finally call our own. So when we finally moved into our first house, it felt like the ultimate victory. My parents were proud of their achievement, but owning a home was a mixed blessing. We had stability and security, but we also had a lot of responsibility. One of the biggest challenges was the upkeep. My parents had to become instant experts on everything from plumbing to landscaping, and they spent countless hours fixing leaky faucets and mowing the lawn. They also had to worry about the mortgage, property taxes, and insurance. I learned early on that owning a home was a lot of work. Despite the challenges, I grew to love our little house. It wasn't perfect, but it was ours. We hung pictures on the walls, planted a garden, and had cookouts with our neighbors. We had a sense of pride and ownership that we had never experienced before. For the first time, we had a place that was truly our own. But our story is not unique. Millions of people in this country have experienced displacement and instability. Some have been forced to move due to economic hardship, others due to natural disasters, and still others due to political upheaval. But regardless of the cause, displacement takes a toll on families and communities. It disrupts routines, separates people from their support systems, and erodes a sense of belonging. For many, homeownership is the ultimate goal, a symbol of stability and permanence that represents a new start. For me, owning a home is about more than just the material benefits. It's about reclaiming a sense of agency and control. When my family owned our own home, we had the power to make decisions about how we lived. We could paint the walls whatever color we wanted, hang pictures without having to ask permission, and build a sense of community with our neighbors. Homeownership gave us a sense of pride and agency that we had never experienced before. But owning a home is not a panacea. There are still many obstacles that stand in the way of homeownership, especially for marginalized communities. Despite the fact that homeownership has been a central part of the American Dream for generations, the reality is that it is still out of reach for many. The racial wealth gap, coupled with decades of discriminatory housing policies, means that people of color are far less likely to own homes than their white counterparts. Additionally, the rising cost of homes, especially in urban areas, means that many people simply can't afford to buy even if they wanted to. As a society, we need to do more to make homeownership accessible to everyone. This means addressing issues such as redlining, discrimination in lending, and the lack of affordable housing. We must also provide resources to help people navigate the complicated process of buying a home, from financial management to home repair. Despite the challenges, I remain hopeful that we can create a future where everyone has the opportunity to own their own home. Homeownership is not just a way to accrue wealth; it is a fundamental component of a healthy and vibrant community. When people feel a sense of ownership over their homes, they are more likely to invest in their communities, to care for their neighbors, and to build a sense of collective pride. Homeownership offers a way to break the cycle of displacement and instability that plagues so many families, providing a foundation of stability and security that can last for generations. In many ways, my family's experience with homeownership reflects the struggles and triumphs of millions of families across this country. We know firsthand how difficult it is to achieve this goal, and how much work it takes to maintain a home. But we also know how much it can mean to have a place that is truly your own, a place where you can put down roots and build a life. As I prepare to embark on my own journey after years of displacement, I am committed to working towards a future where everyone has the opportunity to experience the joy and pride of homeownership.",0,2.38764353,2.702890721,2.862565438,3.142018712,2.785583196,12.4,14.8,18.4,23.6,15.0
C1,423,"Growing up in my small town, getting a college education seemed like a distant dream. Many in my community had not pursued higher education, and it was uncommon to hear someone speak about college as a real possibility. Despite this, I was determined to break free from the status quo and become the first in my family to attend a top-tier university. As a high school student, I threw myself into every extracurricular activity I could find, hoping to set myself apart and catch the attention of college admissions officers. I took on leadership roles in my school's debate team, cultural club, and volunteer organizations. I participated in sports and attended summer camps to hone my skills. And all the while, I worked tirelessly to keep my grades up and maintain stellar academic performance. Despite my ambitious pursuits, I often found myself feeling discouraged and alone. None of my peers seemed to share my passion for education, and many of my teachers did not have the resources or time to provide me with the support I needed. It was during this time that I realized the power of mentorship and community. I began to seek out other students who were also passionate about learning, forming study groups and discussion circles to share ideas and support each other. I also connected with college students and alumni through online forums and mentorship programs, gaining valuable insights on how to navigate the complex world of college admissions. As I continued to work towards my goal of attending a top-tier university, I also took on leadership roles in community organizations, using my platform to advocate for educational opportunities and resources for all students. I worked to raise awareness about the challenges faced by first-generation college students and the importance of mentorship in achieving academic success. As I reflect on my journey, I realize that my pursuit of education has been about more than just achieving personal success. It has been about breaking down barriers and changing the narrative for others who come from similar backgrounds. It has been about using my own experiences to mentor and inspire others and to create pathways for future generations to achieve their dreams. While I know that attending a top-tier university will be a challenge, I am ready for the hard work and the opportunities it will bring. I am excited to join a community of trailblazers and changemakers, to bring my unique perspective and voice to the table and to learn from my peers and mentors. In the end, it is not just about achieving a title or a degree. It is about the impact that I can make in the world - using my education, my experiences, and my network to create positive change and uplift those around me. And I know that, with dedication, perseverance, and community support, I can achieve anything I set my mind to.",0,2.879825857,3.029308432,3.181955068,3.411128024,3.10372587,15.0,20.2,24.0,27.8,22.5
C2,424,"I vividly remember the sound of my family's footsteps as we walked towards the dilapidated house that was to be our new home. The creaking wooden stairs echoed in the silence of the barren yard. The front door, dented and rusted, swayed open with a loud creak. I was hit with the unpleasant smell of mold and decay that permeated the air. The floors were splintered and warped, and the walls showed signs of rot and termite damage. This was the place my family was going to call home. My family had been forced to move frequently over the years, always struggling to make ends meet. Rent prices were always just out of reach, and each new landlord would come up with a new reason for why we had to leave. But despite these challenges, my family never gave up their dream of one day owning their own home. The road to homeownership was not an easy one, however. My family had to save up for years, constantly making sacrifices and adapting to changes in their employment. They spent countless hours searching for a home that would fit their needs and their budget. And when they finally found one that showed some promise, it was practically uninhabitable. Yet my family tackled each hurdle with determination and resilience. We spent months working tirelessly, tearing out the moldy floors, replacing the rotten walls and ceiling, and creating a home out of a derelict building. And finally, after years of displacement, my family had a place to call their own. Our new home was humble and small- just a two-bedroom cottage- but the pride we felt for it was immense. As we sat on the porch, watching the sun set over the trees, we finally felt a sense of belonging. We were no longer at the mercy of rising rent prices or capricious landlords. We had control over our lives and a strong foundation to build upon. Looking back on this experience, I realize the tremendous symbolism behind my family's journey. Our journey was not just about owning a home, but about reclaiming our autonomy and taking charge of our destiny. It was a reminder that with determination and hard work, even the most dilapidated buildings can be transformed into a space of warmth and belonging. Now, as I embark on my own journey, I carry with me the lessons my family taught me. Homeownership is not just about having a place to live, but about having a stake in your community, a sense of pride, and a foundation for a better future. It is about resilience, determination, and the unshakable belief that one can create the life they dream of. And as I strive towards my own goals, I am reminded that with grit, perseverance, and a steadfast belief in oneself, anything is possible.",0,2.714592847,2.793618955,2.82972439,3.080119158,2.815073927,13.2,15.4,18.0,22.4,17.0
H,425,"Red, orange, purple, gold...I was caught in a riot of shifting colors. I pranced up and down the hill, my palms extended to the moving collage of butterflies that surrounded me. “Would you like to learn how to catch one?” Grandfather asked, holding out a glass jar. “Yes!” I cheered, his huge calloused fingers closing my chubby five-year-old hands around it carefully. Grandfather put his finger to his lips, and I obliged as I watched him deftly maneuver his net. He caught one marvelous butterfly perched on a flower, and I clutched the open jar in anticipation as he slid the butterfly inside. It quivered and fell to the bottom of the jar, and I gasped. It struggled until its wings, ablaze in a glory of orange and red, quivered to a stop. I watched, wide-eyed, as it stopped moving. “Grandpa! What’s happening?” They were not meant to live forever: their purpose was to flame brilliantly and then fade away. Thus, his art serves as a memory of their beauty, an acknowledgement of nature's ephemeral splendor. My grandfather had always had a collection of butterflies, but that was the first time I saw him catch one. After witnessing the first butterfly die, I begged him to keep them alive; I even secretly let some of them go. Therefore, to compromise, he began carrying a special jar for the days I accompanied him on his outings, a jar to keep the living butterflies. But the creatures we caught always weakened and died after a few days in captivity, no matter how tenderly I fed and cared for them. Grandfather took me aside and explained that the lifespan of an adult butterfly was very short. They were not meant to live forever: their purpose was to flame brilliantly and then fade away. Thus, his art serves as a memory of their beauty, an acknowledgement of nature’s ephemeral splendor. But nothing could stay the same. I moved to America and as the weekly excursions to the mountainside ended, so did our lessons in nature and science. Although six thousand miles away, I would never forget how my grandpa’s wrinkles creased when he smiled or how he always smelled like mountain flowers. As I grew older and slowly understood how Grandfather lived his life, I began to follow in his footsteps. He protected nature’s beauty from decay with his art, and in the same way, I tried to protect my relationships, my artwork, and my memories. I surrounded myself with the journals we wrote together, but this time I recorded my own accomplishments, hoping to one day show him what I had done. I recorded everything, from the first time I spent a week away from home to the time I received a gold medal at the top of the podium at the California Tae Kwon Do Competition. I filled my new home in America with the photographs from my childhood and began to create art of my own. Instead of catching butterflies like my grandpa, I began experimenting with butterfly wing art as my way of preserving nature’s beauty. Soon my home in America became a replica of my home in China, filled from wall to wall with pictures and memories. Nine long years passed before I was reunited with him. The robust man who once chased me up the hillside had developed arthritis, and his thick black hair had turned white. The grandfather I saw now was not the one I knew; we had no hobby and no history in common, and he became another adult, distant and unapproachable. With this, I forgot all about the journals and photos that I had kept and wanted to share with him. After weeks of avoidance, I gathered my courage and sat with him once again. This time, I carried a large, leather-bound book with me. “Grandfather,” I began, and held out the first of my many journals. These were my early days in America, chronicled through pictures, art, and neatly-printed English. On the last page was a photograph of me and my grandfather, a net in his hand and a jar in mine. As I saw our faces, shining with proud smiles, I began to remember our days on the mountainside, catching butterflies and halting nature’s eventual decay. My grandfather has weakened over the years, but he is still the wise man who raised me and taught me the value of capturing the beauty of life. Although he has grown old, I have grown up. His legs are weak, but his hands are still as gentle as ever. Therefore, this time, it will be different. This time, I will no longer recollect memories, but create new ones.",1,2.54007053,2.80169284,2.970243262,3.260370919,2.897218095,12.0,16.0,20.0,23.8,18.5
C0,426,"In an age where technology and urbanization dominate daily life, it has become increasingly common for people to forget about the natural world around them. However, amongst the unchanging chaos found in our modern society, nature still has the power to amaze us with its ephemeral beauty. The beauty of nature, however, is not just limited to the tranquil moments of a sunny day, but also includes the fleeting, dynamic moments that make the outdoors so unpredictable. These chaotic moments are what make nature so powerful and so crucial to preserve. Nature’s ability to change is what gives it its ephemeral beauty. A mountain range may seem unchangingly static, but in reality, it is constantly shifting due to erosion, tectonic movements and the changing climate. Similarly, oceans may seem expansive and immobile, but in reality, are ever-changing with the tides, currents, and the weather. It is the ever-changing nature of the Earth that makes it so awe-inspiring, so enchanting, and so worthy of our effort to preserve. Nevertheless, it is difficult to preserve something so dynamic and uncontrollable. It seems our only choice is to enjoy the natural world while we can, and to cherish the ephemeral beauty it puts before us. This is where my passion for photography becomes relevant. Photography provides a way to capture the beauty of the outdoors in a way that allows us to preserve specific moments of ephemeral beauty forever. One photo can encapsulate a moment where a peaceful sunset can turn into a stormy sky, where the once arid desert transforms into a blooming meadow, or where the calm ocean waves suddenly break into a roaring surf. At first, I would take photos purely for my own enjoyment, capturing moments of ephemeral beauty that I would then share with my friends and family. But then, as my interest in photography increased, I became aware of how my photos could represent something more significant than just images of natural beauty. I realised that the photos I took would serve on a larger scale, a documentation of nature's ever-changing beauty. With every photo, I watched with awe as nature performed its majestic act, allowing me to capture a mere moment of it. But as I delved deeper into the world of photography, I came to realize that my passion for nature photography also held a responsibility to preserve the world’s ephemeral beauty. My passion needed to be combined with action. So, I began searching for ways I could use my unique skill to help preserve nature. The answer came to me through an opportunity provided by a summer program I attended at a research station deep in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. There, I worked alongside researchers and local conservationists to document and study the ecosystem of the Amazon. In this isolated world, I found myself coming face to face with the immense power of nature. Every day, I would capture images of the animals around me, from a baby owl learning to fly to a ferocious jaguar claiming its territory. But the photos only told half the story. It was the unspoken understanding of the ecosystems that surrounded them that made the photos so powerful. Seeing this firsthand gave me a new appreciation for the importance of preserving nature's ephemeral beauty. It became blatantly obvious that if we do not actively protect nature's everchanging beauty, we not only lose these magical moments forever but also harm our own relationship with the natural world. With the destruction of fauna and flora, we lose the documentation of the ephemeral moments that make the outdoors so enthralling. This realisation has brought about a significant change in my outlook on the environment. The beauty of the world is not something that should disappear with the ever-continuing march of time. We must take steps to preserve the ephemeral moments it gifts us. This is why I have made a commitment to work towards increasing the awareness of the importance of environmental conservation through photography. My goal is simple, I want to empower others who share my passion in photography to use their unique skill to portray the importance of preserving nature’s ephemeral beauty. So, whether you’re a photographer, a scientist or a conservationist, there is something we can all do to help preserve nature's ephemeral beauty. I firmly believe that as we document the ever-changing natural world, we can begin to understand the importance of preserving these moments. By documenting the complexity of the natural world, we can increase awareness, drive conservation efforts and ultimately ensure that future generations will be able to capture the same magical moments that we so fervently seek today. The beauty of the world is not something that should disappear. Nature continues to inspire us with its ephemeral beauty and, as photographers, scientists or conservationists, we can all play our part in protecting it for the generations to come. By coming together, we can collectively work to preserve nature's ever-changing beauty, ensuring that its unique essence remains unchanged and forever everlasting.",0,2.602476564,2.971565348,3.233319999,3.395200114,3.092012779,14.0,19.0,23.0,26.2,22.0
C1,427,"As long as I can remember, nature has always been a source of inspiration for me. Growing up in the countryside, surrounded by the vibrant colors and sounds of the outdoors, I was always captivated by the natural world. There was something about the ever-changing beauty of nature that seemed to reflect the spontaneity of life, rendering nature both captivating and ephemeral. The butterflies of my youth seem a lifetime ago, but their memory has continued to impact my perspective on nature. As I left my childhood home and moved halfway across the world to pursue my academic goals, I was struck by the wild and untamed beauty of the American outdoors. There was a fierceness to nature here that was entirely different from what I was used to back in China. As I wandered through the national parks and nature reserves, snapping pictures of the constantly shifting beauty of the natural world, I found myself drawn to the power and unpredictability of the landscape. It was this unpredictability that I hoped to capture on film, this unmanufactured beauty that I wanted to preserve. However, as I became more engrossed in my photography, I realized that my efforts were not enough. I may have been taking beautiful pictures, but my images themselves were no more than fleeting moments. In order to preserve the beauty of the natural world for future generations, I needed to take a more active role in conservation. It was then that I decided to follow in my grandfather's footsteps and explore the world of art. Like him, I hoped to create something tangible from the ephemeral beauty that surrounds us. The creation of such works would provide an opportunity to document the ever-shifting beauty of the natural world while also shining light on the importance of preserving the environment. My photography opened new doors for my artwork. I began experimenting with ways to incorporate photographs into mixed media projects, allowing me to create artwork that not only captured the distinct moments of ephemeral beauty that I had come to cherish so deeply but also served as a powerful reminder of the importance of conservation. As I dedicated myself to my artwork, I realized that my passion for nature was shared by many other young people like myself. Our generation is beginning to realize the importance of preserving the environment and has become increasingly involved in conservation efforts. As artists, we are uniquely poised to leverage our creative skills to inspire our peers, to bring attention to important environmental issues, and to make a tangible difference in the world. At first, I was hesitant to speak out and share my perspective. After all, I was just a student with a passion for conservation, photography, and art. But I quickly realized that my voice mattered. By sharing my unique perspective, I was able to inspire those around me and to help them realize that their own unique skills and talents could be used for something greater than their own enjoyment. It is this realization that has motivated me to pursue my passions in a more active role. By engaging with others and sharing my artwork, I hope to inspire the same love of nature that has shaped and informed my own artistic journey. Whether through photographs, art installations, or environmental initiatives, we all have the power to make a difference. As I look back on my journey so far, I am struck by the realization that conservation and art are not mutually exclusive concepts – in fact, they are quite complementary. Through our artwork, we can capture and preserve the ephemeral beauty of nature, while also helping to raise awareness about the urgent need to protect our environment. The road ahead may be long, and the challenges of environmental preservation are daunting. However, I remain hopeful. I believe that, together, we can harness the power of art and conservation, to create a brighter and more sustainable future for ourselves and for generations to come.",0,2.614645258,2.868230961,3.183668908,3.508083531,2.976847993,15.0,18.0,23.0,29.0,20.0
C2,428,"The sound of rushing water is always present. It's the first thing that greets me when I wake up in the morning and the last thing I hear before I fall asleep at night. I grew up surrounded by the sound of streams and rivers, and it's a sound that I've come to associate with peace and tranquility. As I moved to the United States to pursue my education, I was struck by the difference in the landscape. The sounds were different too. Here, it was the rustling of leaves that I heard, mixed with the chirping of crickets and the occasional hooting of an owl. The sounds were wilder, more untamed, reflecting the fierce beauty of the American wilderness. It was this beauty that first inspired me to pick up a camera. I wanted to capture the essence of the outdoors, to document the moments of wild, unbridled beauty that were constantly unfolding in front of me. And so, I set out on a journey of discovery, camera in hand. As I traveled across the country, visiting national parks and nature reserves, I found myself increasingly drawn to the beauty of the landscape. There were mountains and valleys, deserts and forests, each one more stunning than the last. I was captivated by the sheer wildness of it all, by the knowledge that this was a landscape that remained untamed, unbroken, and unconquerable. I soon discovered that my camera was not enough. It could capture moments of beauty, but it could not capture the essence of the landscape as a whole. And so, I turned to art, seeking a medium that would allow me to do justice to the beauty that surrounded me. My grandfather was an artist in his own right. He worked primarily in oils, capturing the Chinese landscape in all its vibrancy and subtlety. I still remember watching him as a child, with his paintbrush poised over the canvas, each stroke of the brush adding depth and nuance to his work. His art was a reflection of his deep love for the natural world, and it was that love that I hoped to capture in my own work. I experimented with different mediums, finally settling on mixed media. I found that I could use photographs as a base, building layer upon layer of paint and collage to create a work of art that was both visually stunning and emotionally impactful. Each work of art was a reflection of a specific moment in time – a sunset over the Grand Canyon or a storm brewing over a mountain lake. Each piece was a reflection of the wild, untamed beauty of the natural world. But I quickly realized that my art was more than just a reflection of my love for nature. It was also an opportunity to encourage others to take action to preserve the environment. As a Chinese immigrant, I know all too well the impact that human activity can have on the natural world. I grew up in a country where pollution was rampant and environmental degradation was a fact of life. And yet, I also knew that there was hope. China is now leading the world in renewable energy, working to reverse the damage that has been done to the environment. I believe that art can play a role in this process of environmental restoration. By capturing the beauty of the natural world, we can remind people of what is at stake. We can inspire them to take action, to stand up for the environment and fight for its preservation. I am still learning, still exploring the possibilities that art has to offer. But one thing is clear – art and conservation are not mutually exclusive concepts. They are, in fact, intimately connected. Through our artwork, we can capture the beauty of the natural world, while also raising awareness about the urgent need to protect it. As I look to the future, I am filled with hope. I hope to continue to create art that inspires others to take action. I hope to continue to explore and document the beauty of the natural world. And most of all, I hope to play a role in securing a brighter, more sustainable future for all of us.",0,2.504265065,2.656851872,2.90118159,3.152350902,2.729305055,13.0,14.0,19.0,23.0,17.0
H,429,"I hate the letter 'S'. Of the 164,777 words with 'S', I only grapple with one. To condemn an entire letter because of its use 0.0006% of the time sounds statistically absurd, but that one case changed 100% of my life. I used to have two parents, but now I have one, and the 'S' in 'parents' isn’t going anywhere. 'S' follows me. I can’t get through a day without being reminded that while my friends went out to dinner with their parents, I ate with my parent. As I write this essay, there is a blue line under the word 'parent' telling me to check my grammar; even Grammarly assumes that I should have parents, but cancer doesn’t listen to edit suggestions. I won’t claim that my situation is as unique as 1 in 164,777, but it is still an exception to the rule - an outlier. The world isn’t meant for this special case. The world wouldn’t abandon 'S' because of me, so I tried to abandon 'S'. I could get away from 'S' if I stayed busy; you can’t have dinner with your 'parent' (thanks again, Grammarly) if you’re too busy to have family dinner. Any spare time that I had, I filled. I became known as the 'busy kid'- the one that everyone always asks, 'How do you have time?' Morning meetings, classes, after school meetings, volleyball practice, dance class, rehearsal in Boston, homework, sleep, repeat. Though my specific schedule has changed over time, the busyness has not. I couldn’t fill the loss that 'S' left in my life, but I could at least make sure I didn’t have to think about it. There were so many things in my life that I couldn’t control, so I controlled what I could- my schedule. I never succumbed to the stress of potentially over-committing. I thrived. It became a challenge to juggle it all, but I’d soon find a rhythm. But rhythm wasn’t what I wanted. Rhythm may not have an 'S', but 'S' sure liked to come by when I was idle. So, I added another ball, and another, and another. Soon I noticed that the same 'color' balls kept falling into my hands- theater, academics, politics. I began to want to come into contact with these more and more, so I further narrowed the scope of my color wheel and increased the shades of my primary colors. Life became easier to juggle, but for the first time, I didn’t add another ball. I found my rhythm, and I embraced it. I stopped running away from a single 'S' and began chasing a double 'S'- passion. Passion has given me purpose. I was shackled to 'S' as I tried to escape the confines of the traditional familial structure. No matter how far I ran, 'S' stayed behind me because I kept looking back. I’ve finally learned to move forward instead of away, and it is liberating. 'S' got me moving, but it hasn’t kept me going. I wish I could end here, triumphant and basking in my new inspiration, but life is more convoluted. Motivation is a double edged sword; it keeps me facing forward, but it also keeps me from having to look back. I want to claim that I showed courage in being able to turn from 'S', but I cannot. Motivation is what keeps 'S' at bay. I am not perfectly healed, but I am perfect at navigating the best way to heal me. I don’t seek out sadness, so 'S' must stay on the sidelines, and until I am completely ready, motivation is more than enough for me.'",1,2.18537407,2.522471896,2.640031324,2.899294588,2.572640129,8.0,14.0,17.0,22.6,15.0
C0,430,"Losing someone you love is one of the hardest experiences a person can go through. The pain and sadness that come with the loss of someone close can leave a void that feels impossible to fill. During the summer of my sophomore year of high school, I was faced with the devastating news of my grandfather's passing, and it felt like the world had come crashing down on my family and me. My grandfather, affectionately known as Papa, had always been a source of love and support for us, and the thought of life without him was unbearable. I was left grappling with how to move on from the overwhelming grief and emptiness I felt, but over time, I learned that healing doesn't happen overnight; it is a gradual process that takes time, patience, and a little bit of courage. Initially, I tried to avoid confronting my grief head-on. I threw myself into schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and anything else that kept me busy. I figured that the more I stayed occupied, the less time I would have to think about what had happened. But as the months went by, I found that this strategy wasn't helping me at all. I would catch myself zoning out in class, getting irritable with friends and family, and feeling tired all the time. It became clear that no matter how much I tried to distract myself, my grief was still very much present in my life. I realized that if I wanted to move on from my grief, I needed to acknowledge my feelings instead of avoiding them. Talking to my family helped me a lot because they knew exactly what I was going through. We shared memories of Papa, cried together, laughed together, and even argued about trivial things, which helped relieve some of the heaviness I was carrying. I also found relief in creative outlets, such as writing, drawing, and playing music. These activities helped me express my emotions in a way that wasn't possible through words alone. In hindsight, what was helpful in the immediate aftermath of my grandfather's death did not necessarily help me in the long run. No amount of work, academics, or success could have taken away the pain. Indeed, the pain lingered because how dear and profound these experiences are. Encountering grief forced me to reassess my priorities and shift my focus to emotional honesty, compassion, and communication with others. One of the most important things I discovered during my healing process was the profound impact of gratitude and mindfulness. I became more aware of the simple pleasures in my life, such as a beautiful sunset or a kind word from a friend. I learned to appreciate the present moment, to savor it and find joy in the little things. It was not always easy, but appreciating the present and finding gratification in small things helped push through what seemed like an insurmountable obstacle in my grief. Now, I think of my grandfather with a sense of gratitude rather than only despair. Yes, he's gone, but what he left in our lives and the lessons we learned from him will always remain. Grieving was a necessary step for me to move on, and I hope that anyone who faces this kind of experience, too, realizes this too. But beyond healing, it helped me understand that all experiences, whether they be positive or negative, make an impact in our lives that enriches us if we remain open-minded and resilient. In conclusion, I learned that grief isn't something that you can just 'get over.' It is a process that takes time, patience, and self-awareness. Moving on from grief means being intentional in your emotions, allowing yourself to express, and not shying away from the pain. It also means embracing the beautiful moments that come with living in the present, taking steps forward despite the weight of the loss. Most importantly, moving on from grief is about finding grace in the face of tragedy. I believe this to be the most valuable lesson I have gathered in my high school years, and will take it with me long into my future for continued growth and resilience.",0,2.489971504,2.59666647,2.775496598,3.09705742,2.660249997,14.6,17.6,21.0,25.0,20.0
C1,431,"Losing someone you love is never easy, and it often feels like your world has come to a standstill. I understand this all too well as I witnessed the loss of a loved one during the summer of my sophomore year. My best friend, who had always been there for me, suddenly passed away, and my world was turned upside down. Everything that had brought me joy before seemed insignificant, and I found myself grappling with an overwhelming sadness that seemed to have no end. However, though it wasn't easy, I eventually discovered that this tragedy did not have to define me, but instead become a tool for growth and resilience. Initially, I coped by throwing myself into work, studies, and anything that could distract me from the pain. I was trying to simulate the feeling of normality that had been ripped away from me so suddenly. Nevertheless, I came to realize that this only perpetuated the pain. I needed to confront my emotions, to let myself experience the vast array of feelings that came with losing my friend. It was only after surrendering to my emotions that I began to work towards healing from the pain that had been inflicted upon me. The grieving process can be long and arduous, and I certainly found this to be true. I spent a lot of time with those that were similarly affected by my friend's death, and together we worked to process the loss. We shared stories, memories, and moments we had with him that brought us laughter when only tears seemed to be present. It was by exchanging these stories that we started to recognize the enormous impact our friend had on each of us, and that while he was no longer physically present, he would never truly leave us. During the grieving process, I also learned the importance of self-care. I made sure to practice mindfulness techniques to keep myself centered and present, despite the weight of the tragedy that had occurred. Taking the time to relax, meditate, and focus on my wellbeing allowed me to confront my emotions head-on when I needed to. In this, I began to realize that self-care was not something to feel guilty about but rather, it was essential in my journey to healing. As time went on, I continued to heal, but it was only then that I realized how much I had grown since experiencing the loss of my friend. I began to see the world with more understanding and compassion, and it transformed the way I lived my life. I cherished the moments I spent with others, remembering that they, like my friend, are fleeting and precious. I was more empathetic towards those that were hurting, even when they didn't show it. It was only in the tragic moments that I learned the extent of my strength and resilience, and how much we all can overcome if we choose hope and togetherness over despair. Looking back on the period of grieving that I went through, I realize that the pain and despair could have overtaken me. Still, instead, it transformed me for the better. By confronting the negative emotions instead of pushing them aside, I was able to process them in a healthy way, come to a point of peace, and gain a newfound appreciation for life. By allowing my emotions to lead me to growth and positive change, I was able to continue moving forward while still honoring and cherishing the memory of my dear friend. In conclusion, when we lose someone we love, the pain can feel unbearable, and the future may seem bleak. Yet, that doesn't mean we should avoid confronting our emotions to cope with our grief. Though it may be difficult, by allowing ourselves to experience and process the pain that comes with loss, we may ultimately come to a point of growth and resilience that positively impacts ourselves and those around us. The loss of my best friend was devastating, but through it, I learned that embracing our emotions, practicing self-care, and being empathetic to others is what allows us to move forward with hope, even when faced with despair.",0,2.461230543,2.728491809,2.84514543,3.091189161,2.815448973,18.0,20.0,22.0,28.0,22.0
C2,432,"The sun was high up in the sky, bathing the world in a golden warmth that I couldn't feel. I sat on the ground, staring at the sky, feeling numb. There was nothing special about the day, but for me, it marked the moment when everything in my life changed. The day that my best friend passed away, he that had always been there for me. As the days passed, I tried to keep myself busy. I buried myself in my studies, work, and anything that could distract me from the pain. It did nothing to stop the anguish that plagued me. Every time I tried to ignore my feelings, I realized that it only made them worse. I needed to confront the emotions that were consuming me. When I allowed myself to feel the pain, even though it was excruciating, it helped me realize that I wasn't alone. I wasn't the only one hurting; we all were. I shared memories of my friend with others who were also affected, and together we found support in each other. We talked about the way he laughed, how he made jokes whenever the mood was down, and the experience that brought us closer to him. Grief had made me realize that life was fragile and fleeting, and that every moment spent with those we loved was precious. It had transformed me into someone who appreciated life at its fullest. I savoured each moment spent with friends and family, cherishing the time we had together. The scent of blooming flowers filled the air, a warm breeze tousled my hair as I sat in the garden. It was one year after my best friend's passing, and I was fighting that same familiar feeling of grief. But this time, I let myself feel it, the pain. Every tear, every ache allowed me to connect with my emotions and harness my resilience. I learned that self-care was not selfish but necessary. I took time off to tend to my mental and emotional health, meditating, and practicing mindfulness techniques. Self-care pulled me back from the abyss of despair, reminding me to take a step back when I needed it. The pain did not go away overnight. It still lingered, but this time, I wasn't alone. I had my memories of my friend, and I had others who understood my pain. Over time, the wound in my heart began to heal, slowly but surely. As the months passed, I realized that the loss of my friend had allowed me to build strength and resilience. I appreciated life to a greater extent, with a level of depth that I never understood before. But most importantly, I had the ability to connect with others in their moments of pain and provide comfort and empathy. The pain of grief is like a storm that comes and goes, but when we allow ourselves to feel it, we discover that strength and resilience lie within us. The journey to healing isn't easy, but the process itself is a learning experience, and we can come out stronger when we confront our pain. Grief transformed me into someone who values every moment with those I love and empathize with people in their moments of pain. My journey through grief would never have been one that I would have wanted, nor one that I would wish on anyone else. However, I have learned that in the darkest moments, we can find hope and emerge stronger than before. Pain is something that should never be suppressed or ignored; instead, it should be embraced so that we can grow from it. By sharing our stories, memories, and love for those we have lost, we can find comfort in each other and build strength from the pain. In conclusion, losing someone close to us is one of the toughest moments in life, and it's an inevitable part of the journey. The pain is real and can be excruciating, but by confronting it head-on, we can become resilient and come out stronger. Practicing self-care, sharing stories, and memories, and cherishing the time spent with loved ones are critical steps toward healing. Grief has left an indelible mark on my heart, but it has also allowed me to grow and appreciate life to a greater extent.

H,433,"In hazy stillness, a sudden flurry of colored skirts, whispers of “Merde!” Sternly, my fingers smooth back my hair, although they know no loose strands will be found. My skin absorbs heat from stage lights above—if only that heat would seep into my brain, denature some proteins, and deactivate the neurons stressing me out. A warm hand, accompanied by an even warmer smile, interrupts my frenzied solitude. I glance up. My lovely teacher nods, coaxing my frozen lips into a thawed smile. A complex figure, filled in with doubt, yet finished with shades of confidence: My body takes its place and waits. One, two, three, four; two, two, three, four. On stage, the lights and music wash over me. Never having had a true ballet solo before, my lungs are one breath away from hyperventilating. Trying to achieve a Zen-like state, I imagine a field of daisies, yet my palms continue sweating disobediently. It’s not that I’ve never been on stage alone before; I’ve had plenty of piano recitals and competitions. Yet, while both performances consume my mind and soul, ballet demands complete commitment of my body. Gently slide into arabesque and lean downward; try not to fall flat on face—Mom’s videotaping. In terms of mentality, I would hardly be described as an introvert; yet, a fear of failure has still kept me from taking risks. Maybe I was scared of leaping too high, falling too far, and hitting the hard floor. As I moved up in the cutthroat world of dance, this fear only increased; the pressure of greater expectations and the specter of greater embarrassment had held me contained. Now, every single eyeball is on me. Lean extra in this pirouette; it’s more aesthetic. But is it always better to be safe than sorry? Glancing toward the wings, I see my teacher’s wild gesticulations: Stretch your arms out, she seems to mime, More! A genuine smile replaces one of forced enthusiasm; alone on the stage, this is my chance to shine. I breathe in the movements, forget each individual step. More than just imagining, but finally experiencing the jubilation of the music, I allow my splits to stretch across the stage and my steps to extend longer and longer, until I’m no longer safe and my heart is racing. Exhilarated and scared in the best way, I throw myself into my jumps. I no longer need to imagine scenes to get in the mood; the emotions are twirling and leaping within me. Reaching, stretching, grabbing, flinging ... My fear no longer shields me. I find my old passion for ballet, and remember the grace and poise that can nevertheless convey every color of emotion. Playing it safe will leave me part of the backdrop; only by taking risks can I step into the limelight. Maybe I’ll fall, but the rush is worth it. I’ll captain an all-male science bowl team, run a marathon, audition for a musical, and embrace the physical and intellectual elation of taking risks.",1,2.361402886,2.641805897,2.814534696,3.059948888,2.777955752,9.0,14.2,18.0,21.6,16.0
C0,434,"I stood at the edge of the high dive, staring down at the rippling blue water below me. My heart pounded in my chest, and my palms were slick with sweat. I knew I had to jump, but the fear of failure was overwhelming. What if I belly-flopped into the water, embarrassing myself in front of my peers? What if I didn't make it to the other side of the pool? Despite the urging of the lifeguard, I froze, unable to take that leap of faith. It wasn't until years later that I learned how to overcome my fear of failure. Growing up, my parents were always pushing me to excel in everything I did. They had high hopes for me, and I never wanted to disappoint them. I would spend hours studying for exams and practicing for competitions, striving for perfection in every aspect of my life. But as I got older, the pressure became too much. The fear of failure consumed me, and I became paralyzed by it. It wasn't until I started college that I realized I needed to change. I was studying engineering, and the coursework was intense. I found myself struggling to keep up with the expectations, and I felt like a failure. But instead of giving up, I sought out help. I formed study groups with my classmates and met with my professors to discuss the material. Slowly but surely, I began to improve. But the most significant change came when I started volunteering at a local after-school program. The kids at the program were from low-income families and didn't have access to the same resources I did growing up. As I worked with them on their homework and played games with them, I realized that the fear of failure was holding them back as well. They were afraid to try new things or take risks because they didn't want to fail. Seeing this in them made me realize that I wasn't alone in my struggles. We all face the fear of failure in some aspect of our lives. Whether it's in our schoolwork, relationships, or career, the fear can be paralyzing. But it's important to remember that failure is not the end-all-be-all. It's simply a stepping stone on the path to success. So how do we overcome this fear? First, we need to reframe our perspective. Failure is not a negative thing. It's an opportunity to learn and grow. When we view it as a lesson rather than a reflection of our abilities, we take away its power over us. We can embrace it as a chance to try again and improve upon our previous efforts. Second, we need to cultivate a growth mindset. Instead of believing that our abilities are fixed, we should view them as malleable. This means acknowledging that we can improve with time and effort. The process is just as important as the outcome. We can't control the outcome, but we can control our dedication and hard work. Lastly, we need to take action. The fear of failure is often worst before we even begin. We get stuck in our heads, playing out every worst-case scenario leading up to the event. But the longer we wait, the more it snowballs, and the fear becomes even more paralyzing. The best way to combat this is to take action. Take that first step towards your goal, no matter how small. As you gain momentum, the fear will dissipate. In the end, it was my experiences with the after-school program that taught me how to overcome my fear of failure. By helping those kids overcome their own fears, I found the strength to overcome my own. I realized that the fear of failure doesn't have to control us. We can choose to view it as an opportunity for growth, and take action towards our goals even if we stumble along the way. Looking back now, I wish I could go back to that high dive and jump without hesitation. But I know that I wouldn't have been ready then. It took time and experiences for me to learn how to overcome my fear of failure. And while the fear never truly goes away, I know now that it doesn't have to control me. I can choose to face it head-on and continue moving forward towards my goals.",0,2.095020124,2.282337177,2.474417481,2.680315066,2.406518019,9.6,13.0,14.0,16.0,13.0
C1,435,"The spotlight flickers on, casting a warm glow over the stage. I take a deep breath and close my eyes, feeling the heat of the lights seep into my skin. The hush of the audience sends a shiver down my spine. In this moment, nothing else matters but the next few minutes of my life. Flashback to a few years ago, and I wouldn’t have even dreamed of standing alone on a stage, let alone performing. The fear of failure had held me back for so long, that I had started to believe that I wasn’t capable of doing anything great. I kept telling myself that it was better to be safe than sorry, that it wasn’t worth my time and effort to try anything new. That is, until I experienced a defining moment that changed my mindset and my life. At the start of high school, I was an average student, interested in a variety of subjects, but not passionate enough to stand out amongst my peers. I found myself constantly comparing myself to others, feeling like I was falling short in every aspect of my life. I watched as my friends joined sports teams, participated in clubs, and generally excelled in whatever they did. That was something I couldn’t visualize for myself. Their success only heightened my doubts and insecurities about my own capabilities. It wasn’t until a friend convinced me to join the school’s theater club that everything changed. Initially, I hesitated, doubting my abilities and the potential criticism I would receive from others. However, I decided to take the risk and show up. It was there that I discovered a side of myself I didn’t know existed; a side dedicated, passionate, and willing to push through challenges poised by others. Instead of running away from it, being part of the club taught me to embrace the possibilities outside of my comfort zone. I took on more complex roles that challenged me and demanded growth. I went beyond the basics, and learned to dive deep into my character analysis and interpretation. The fear of failure that had held me back for so long began to dissipate. It was replaced with the newfound confidence that came with every successfully completed performance. The experience with the club spilled over into other aspects of my life, as well. I started participating in other activities with renewed vigor, challenging my physical and intellectual limits. I found a new love for dance, basketball, and volunteering activities. Obstacles and failures stopped paralyzing, and instead became an opportunity to learn and grow. Now, as a senior about to attend one of the top universities in the country, I am grateful for the opportunity to acknowledge my fears, and to have taken the necessary steps to overcome them. I have learned firsthand that the fear of failure is the source of limiting beliefs that can prevent you from pursuing your hopes and dreams. It can keep you from realizing your full potential. Fear of failure can manifest in a variety of ways - procrastination, avoidance, stagnation, among others. However, the only way to truly overcome that fear is to acknowledge its existence and face it. “Easier said than done,” is often an overused cliché, but that is precisely what one must do. There is no magic formula or solution, but the key is to understand that taking a step in the right direction is still better than not moving at all. As I look back on my progress, I don’t see a dramatic change overnight. Rather, it was a series of small, consistent steps that eventually led me to realize my full potential. It was acknowledging what I wanted, pursuing it with zeal and persevering through all obstacles that came my way. I had finally stopped letting my fear of failure control my life and my potential. In conclusion, life is a journey full of twists and turns, successes and failures. No one can guarantee that the path to success will be easy, but we must first accept that failure is a natural part of the journey, and not a proof of our limitations. True success and growth come from overcoming our fears and taking action towards our desired goals. For me, joining the theater club changed everything, and finally, I was able to unlock my potential. By understanding the role of the fear of failure, we can start to overcome it, and pursue the lives we truly want.

C2,436,"The faint smell of chalk and the sound of students shuffling their papers and backpacks in the hallway pervaded my senses as I walked towards my English class one day freshman year. I felt lost, not just in this high school but my life in general. I was unsure of my strengths and talents and felt like my achievements were nothing compared to my peers. However, little did I know that a seemingly inconsequential decision would change the course of my life forever. The sign outside the drama room read: “Welcome To The Club For The Creative”. I had never considered myself a creative person and had zero acting experience. However, something about the room called to me. So, I took a step into the unknown and I joined the drama club. Months of rehearsals and character development allowed me to forget my insecurities and focus on bringing my character to life. I realized that instead of being mediocre in everything, I had to discover my passion and focus on nurturing it. It was then that I discovered my passion - theatre. Being on stage was my calling. I felt like I was at home with every line I delivered, every movement I made, and every emotion I emoted. The theatre taught me that risk-taking was crucial for growth. Every time I stepped onstage, there was a possibility of failure. However, the possibility of failure wasn’t as daunting anymore. I learned the art of taking calculated risk, and I realized that living on the edge was where true potential lay. Steve Harvey once said, “You can’t just exist in this life, you’ve got to try to live.” And living meant stepping out of my comfort zone and trying new things. Being a part of the drama club was just the beginning - I decided to try my hand at creative writing, competitive speaking, and dance to name a few. Failure was no longer a friend turned foe but just a part of the process. Ups and downs became my motivation, and like a river carving its way through a rock, I too carved my way through life’s obstacles. This change in mindset is what brought me here to this moment - applying to Yale and Harvard. I never thought I’d have the courage to apply to these institutions, but I know that the only thing stopping me from achieving anything is myself. I embarked on the journey, an unpredictable and uncertain one, but filled with hope and perseverance. Harvard and Yale are only the beginning of my journey. My experiences made me resilient and my passion for theatre has taught me that there is always a story worth telling, and that my dreams are worth pursuing. I am capable of anything I set my mind to, and there is no limit to what I can accomplish. Success is not only the absence of failure but the ability to persevere through it. I am a living testament of this statement. Overcoming the fear of failure is not a one-time event but a continuous process of learning and unlearning. Information and knowledge are fleeting, but persistence and resilience are always present. In conclusion, the drama club gave me a home, a passion, and most importantly, an understanding of my own fears. This understanding formed the foundation of my determination to face obstacles head-on and to pursue my dreams. What I lost in pride, I gained in confidence, and what I lost in insecurities, I gained in courage, and the rewards of constantly pushing myself to live life on the edge. Now, in the heat of the spotlight, the warmth of the lights, and the softness of the room, I am ready to take on the world - one calculated risk at a time.",0,2.401359899,2.662816461,2.849949217,3.143371082,2.808208593,10.8,15.0,19.4,24.4,18.0
H,437,"I had never seen houses floating down a river. Minutes before there had not even been a river. An immense wall of water was destroying everything in its wake, picking up fishing boats to smash them against buildings. It was the morning of March 11, 2011. Seeing the images of destruction wrought by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, I felt as if something within myself was also being shaken, for I had just spent two of the happiest summers of my life there. In the summer of my freshman year, I received the Kikkoman National Scholarship, which allowed me to travel to Japan to stay with a host family in Tokyo for ten weeks. I arrived just as the swine flu panic gripped the world, so I was not allowed to attend high school with my host brother, Yamato. Instead, I took Japanese language, judo, and karate classes and explored the confusing sprawl of the largest city in the world. I spent time with the old men of my neighborhood in the onsen, or hot spring, questioning them about the Japan of their youth. They laughed and told me that if I wanted to see for myself, I should work on a farm. The next summer I returned to Japan, deciding to heed the old men’s advice and volunteer on a farm in Japan’s northernmost island, Hokkaido. I spent two weeks working more than fourteen hours a day. I held thirty-pound bags of garlic with one hand while trying to tie them to a rope hanging from the ceiling with the other, but couldn’t hold the bags in the air long enough. Other days were spent pulling up endless rows of daikon, or Japanese radish, which left rashes on my arms that itched for weeks. Completely exhausted, I stumbled back to the farmhouse, only to be greeted by the family’s young children who were eager to play. I passed out every night in a room too small for me to straighten my legs. One day, I overslept a lunch break by two hours. I awoke mortified, and hurried to the father. After I apologized in the most polite form of Japanese, his face broke into a broad grin. He patted me on the back and said, “You are a good worker, Anthony. There is no need to apologize.” This single exchange revealed the true spirit of the Japanese farmer. The family had lived for years in conditions that thoroughly wore me out in only a few days. I had missed two hours of work, yet they were still perpetually thankful to me. In their life of unbelievable hardship, they still found room for compassion. When I had first gone to Tokyo, I had sought the soul of the nation among its skyscrapers and urban hot springs. The next summer I spurned the beaten track in an attempt to discover the true spirit of Japan. While lugging enormously heavy bags of garlic and picking daikon, I found that spirit. The farmers worked harder than anyone I have ever met, but they still made room in their hearts for me. So when the tsunami threatened the people to whom I owed so much, I had to act. Remembering the lesson of compassion I learned from the farm family, I started a fund-raiser in my community called “One Thousand Cranes for Japan.” Little more than two weeks later, we had raised over $8,000 and a flock of one thousand cranes was on its way to Japan.",1,2.541242988,2.672905804,3.01872936,3.408933773,2.867330283,11.8,17.0,20.0,24.0,18.0
C0,438,"When I applied to be a volunteer on a Japanese farm, I had no idea how much the experience would change me. I had always been interested in Japan, with its vivid culture and fascinating history, but beyond reading a few books and studying the language, I had never immersed myself in the culture. This was my chance to do so while also helping in a meaningful way. What I discovered was a deep sense of community, both on the farm and within the larger society, that opened my eyes to a new way of living. The farm was located in a rural area, surrounded by lush green hills and small farming communities. For the first week, it was just me and a few other volunteers from across the world, hard at work in the fields. It was backbreaking labor, but there was a sense of satisfaction and pride at the end of each day when we saw the progress we had made in the fields. We were their honorary family, and they treated us as such. It was a chance to truly experience the hospitality and warmth of Japanese culture, and to be a part of a community that extended far beyond our farm. One of the most significant things I learned while volunteering on the farm was the importance of sustainability. The Japanese have a deep reverence for the land and agriculture, and they approach it with a sense of purpose that goes beyond the mere production of food. They see it as a way of honoring and nurturing the earth, and they work to ensure that their practices are sustainable and environmentally conscious. As someone who had grown up in an urban environment, the concept of sustainable agriculture was not something I had ever really considered. But being on the farm, seeing the way that they approached farming and the relationship they had with the land, opened my eyes to the possibilities of a more symbiotic relationship between humans and nature. It was one of the most important lessons that I learned during my time volunteering in Japan, and one that I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Another thing I learned during my time on the farm was the importance of community. The Japanese are incredibly communal, and they place a high value on the bonds between people. Whether it was the way our farming team worked together to get the harvest in, or the way that the surrounding villages supported each other in their agricultural pursuits, I was struck by how integral community was to every aspect of life in the area. It made me realize just how important it is for us to connect with others, to find common ground and work together towards a common goal. Whether it is working on a farm or simply living in a community, we are all connected, and it is only by recognizing and embracing that connection that we can truly thrive. Volunteering on a Japanese farm gave me a glimpse into a world that was so different from my own, yet so rich in culture and community. It opened my eyes to new ways of living and showed me the importance of sustainable agriculture and communal living. But perhaps above all else, it gave me a sense of purpose and connection that I had never felt before. In today's world, it is easy to feel disconnected from everything around us, to feel like we are just individual actors in a larger, more chaotic and impersonal world. But the experience of working side by side with people from around the world, who shared a common goal and purpose, made me realize just how vital that sort of connection is. As I embark on my next journey, to college, I carry these lessons with me. I am excited to bring my newfound passion for community and sustainability to my future endeavors, and to connect with others who share these values. And I know that whatever path I choose, I will always remember the experience of volunteering on a Japanese farm as a significant moment in my life, one that shaped me in profound and meaningful ways.",0,2.839658224,3.091857924,3.236064502,3.400169492,3.161374351,17.4,23.0,28.0,31.6,25.5
C1,439,"From the concrete jungle of LA to the serene mountain village of Minami Uonuma, my journey to Japan opened my eyes to a whole new world. As a city girl, I never imagined myself passionate about agriculture or sustainable living, but my summer in Japan changed that. Haruki Murakami eloquently stated, 'when you come out of the storm, you won't be the same person who walked in,' and nothing sums up my transformational journey better. I spent my summer in Tokyo, the most populated city in the world, fearing swine flu and unable to attend my host brother's high school. My saving grace came in attending Japanese language, judo, and karate classes. However, the days spent exploring the confusing sprawl of Tokyo never quite satisfied my curiosity about Japanese culture. The next summer, I made a decision that would change my life forever. I heeded the advice of the old men in my neighborhood, who urged me to experience traditional Japan. I became a volunteer on a farm in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island, in hopes of discovering the true spirit of Japan. My time on the farm stretched my limits, physically and mentally. The work, demanding and unrelenting, required more than fourteen hours of labor each day. The thirty-pound bags of garlic left my arms aching, and pulling endless rows of daikon gave me rashes on my arms that itched for weeks. Yet, despite the pain, the farmer's unrelenting spirit of kindness kept me going. The farmer's spirit of kindness is a critical lesson I learned in Japan. I missed a two-hour lunch break that could have ruined my reputation and my chances of keeping my volunteer position, but the father still praised my work ethic: 'You are a good worker, Anthony. There is no need to apologize.' The farmer's lesson reminds me that hardships do not preclude kindness, and compassion remains a vital necessity in care for oneself and others. My summer of arduous work taught me a new appreciation for sustainable living. It was in Minami Uonuma, the small mountainous village, that I first experienced the depth and intensity of sustainable agriculture. The farmers in Minami Uonuma taught me the importance of sustainability by their reverence for the land they farmed. They performed rituals and offered blessings before planting or harvesting the rice, an action that demonstrates that reverence for nature and deep respect for the environment are necessary without compromising productivity. Their sustainable farming practices allowed them to live with minimal impact on the environment and facilitated a harmonious coexistence with nature. The Japanese farmers taught me that human beings are not the sole center of the universe but are an integral part of an interdependent world. It is the lesson that every act we perform requires consideration of the consequences to our environment. Our planet, our shared home, requires an act of compassion that calls people around the world together. This realization prompted me to start a fund-raiser in my community called 'One Thousand Cranes for Japan.' Seeing the devastating effect of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, it was fitting for me to act with the kindness of the farmer in Japan. We raised over $8,000 and sent a thousand cranes fashioned by the community to Japan, hoping to spread a message of love and kindness. My experience in Japan has shaped my life values and aspirations. It broadened my horizons and gave me a unique perspective on sustainability, cultural exchange, and community building. The farmers' lesson on sustainability and living with minimal impact on the environment rewired my thinking forever. I am passionate about promoting sustainable living and community development and will bring this passion with me wherever life may lead. In conclusion, Japan exposed me to the true meaning of nature and our impact on it, the beauty of sustainable living, and the true essence of compassion. As a high school senior, planning to pursue higher education, my passion for sustainability and community building will drive my studies. The farmer's message of compassion drives my life purpose and my desire to make the world a better place.",0,2.795035484,3.15422063,3.323167589,3.531113605,3.223550566,13.0,17.6,21.0,25.0,19.0
C2,440,"My journey to Japan was far from typical for a teenage city girl. But it was a journey that opened my eyes to a whole new world, one that I had never experienced before. It was a world that consisted of farms, fields, and sustainable living. A world that changed my life forever. My first summer in Japan was not quite what I expected. I was unable to attend my host brother's school due to fears of swine flu. This unexpected sidetrack forced me to take things into my own hands, exploring the confusing sprawl of Tokyo. It was during this time that I realized I wanted to learn more about Japanese culture. The following summer was when I made the decision that ultimately changed my life. I became a volunteer on a farm in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost island. This experience was unlike anything I had ever encountered before. The work was physically and mentally challenging - over fourteen hours of labor each day, including picking up thirty-pound bags of garlic and pulling endless rows of daikon, which left my arms aching and itchy rashes. But there was something different about the farmer that kept me going. The farmer's unrelenting spirit of kindness taught me a critical lesson - that even in the face of adversity, compassion remains a vital necessity. The moments of sharing we had together will always be a special treasure. The farmer taught me, despite hard work under intense heat or extreme cold, one's spirit can bear fruit in greatness. I realized that hardships do not preclude kindness, nor does the lack of material wealth mark one's lack of compassion. This experience taught me that true character doesn't manifest during times of comfort or luxury but during moments of strain and difficulty. My summer of hard work on the farm was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Not only did it give me a newfound appreciation for sustainable living, but it also reminded me of the value of reverence for the land. I visited Minami Uonuma, a small mountainous village, where I experienced the depth and intensity of sustainable agriculture. In Minami Uonuma, the farmers taught me that sustainable farming must come from deep respect and reverence for the environment. Every act of tilling the land or harvesting rice required a ritualistic performance offering blessings to the earth before actual work began. I realized that humans must consider the consequences of every action and consider the environment's impact before preventing a crisis on nature. This realization prompted me to start a fundraiser in my community called 'One Thousand Cranes for Japan.' The 2011 earthquake and tsunami devastated Japan, and I wanted my community to act, even if it was just a small act. We raised over $8,000 and sent one thousand cranes fashioned by our community to Japan as a message of love and kindness. My experience in Japan shaped my values and aspirations. It gave me a unique perspective on sustainability, cultural exchange, and community building. The farmer's lesson on sustainability and living with minimal impact on the environment rewired my thinking. I am passionate about promoting sustainable living and community development, and I plan to pursue these passions during my higher education studies. In my future studies, particularly within an environmental science program, I want to learn more about developing sustainable living solutions for communities. I want to work with people from all over the world to create practical solutions that balance society's growth and environmental preservation. My experience in Japan has given me a different outlook on life. It taught me that humans can learn a lot from nature and how humans can live in harmony with the environment despite development. It showed me that sustainable living practices can result in a better future for humanity, and community development must involve reverence for the environment. In conclusion, my journey to Japan was not only a physical journey but an emotional and mental one that taught me about the importance of compassion and sustainability. I learned how to appreciate the land and how to revere the environment that sustains all humanity. I hope that in the future, I can also share these lessons with others and help make a positive impact on our world.",0,2.663335302,2.865039593,3.14144528,3.389595577,3.028220851,12.6,17.0,20.8,22.0,18.0
H,441,"I entered the surprisingly cool car. Since when is Beijing Line 13 air-conditioned? I’ll take it. At four o’clock in the afternoon only about twenty people were in the subway car. “At least it’s not crowded,” one might have thought. Wrong. The pressure of their eyes on me filled the car and smothered me. “看看！她是外国人！”(Look, look! She’s a foreigner!) An old man very loudly whispered to a child curled up in his lap. “Foreigner,” he called me. I hate that word, “foreigner.” It only explains my exterior. If only they could look inside.… They would know that I actually speak Chinese—not just speak, but love. They would know that this love was born from my first love of Latin—the language that fostered my admiration of all languages. Latin lives in the words we speak around the world today. And translating this ancient language is like watching a play and performing in it at the same time. Each word is an adventure, and on the journey through Virgil’s Aeneid I found that I am more like Aeneas than any living, dead, or fictional hero I know. We share the intrinsic value of loyalty to friends, family, and society. We stand true to our own word, and we uphold others to theirs. Like Aeneas’s trek to find a new settlement for his collapsed Troy, with similar perseverance I, too, wander the seas for my own place in the world. Language has helped me do that. If these subway passengers understood me, they would know that the very reason I sat beside them was because of Latin. Even before Aeneas and his tale, I met Caecilius and Grumio, characters in my first Latin textbook. In translations I learned grammar alongside Rome’s rich history. I realized how learning another language could expose me to other worlds and other people—something that has always excited me. I also realized that if I wanted to know more about the world and the people in it, I would have to learn a spoken language. Spanish, despite the seven years of study prior to Latin, did not stick with me. And the throatiness of French was not appealing. But Chinese, more than these other traditional languages, intrigued me. The doors to new worlds it could open seemed endless. Thus I chose Chinese. If these subway passengers looked inside me, they would find that my knowledge of both Latin and Chinese makes me feel whole. It feels like the world of the past is flowing through me alongside the world of the future. Thanks to Latin, Chinese sticks in my mind like the Velcro on the little boy’s shoes in front of me. If this little boy and his family and friends could look inside, they would understand that Latin laid the foundation for my lifelong commitment to languages. Without words, thoughts and actions would be lost in the space between our ears. To them, I am a foreigner, “外国人” literally translated as “out-of-country person.” I feel, however, more like an advena, the Latin word for “foreigner,” translated as “(one who) comes to (this place).” I came to this place, and I came to this country to stay. Unfortunately, they will not know this until I speak. Then once I speak, the doors will open.",1,2.010924562,2.374550076,2.718033811,2.967671929,2.532285185,6.6,10.0,14.8,20.4,13.0
C0,442,"Growing up in a multilingual household, I have always been interested in the ways that language can connect people from different cultures and backgrounds. As a child, I was able to converse with everyone from my Vietnamese grandparents to my Mexican-American neighbors, simply by switching from English to their native languages. As I grew older, I began to realize the power and complexity of language, and how it can be used as a tool to build bridges between people and countries. When I was fifteen, I travelled to Honduras on a service trip with a group of students from my high school. We stayed with families in small villages, and despite our limited Spanish, we were able to connect with the locals through our shared desire to help and our mutual curiosity about each other's cultures. I remember one day when we visited a school in a nearby village, and were greeted by a group of laughing, curious children. Despite our struggles with the language barrier, we were able to connect through simple gestures like high-fives and fist bumps, and through our shared joy of playing soccer together. That trip ignited a fascination in me with the power of language as a tool for building bridges between people from different countries and cultures. However, it also highlighted the limitations of language as a means of communication. While our efforts to connect with the locals were well-intentioned, they were often hampered by our lack of fluency in Spanish. We struggled to fully grasp the nuances of the culture, and we often found ourselves inadvertently offending people because of our ignorance of local customs. As I continue to explore the role of language as a bridge, I have come to recognize that language proficiency is only one part of the equation. In order to truly connect with people from different cultures, it is essential to approach them with an open mind and heart, and a willingness to learn and understand their unique perspectives and experiences. I have also learned that cultural exchange goes both ways- just as I want to learn about different cultures, people from other countries also want to learn about mine. This lesson was reinforced for me last summer when I participated in a summer exchange program with a school in Japan. My host family spoke little English, and I spoke almost no Japanese, so we had to communicate through a combination of hand gestures, Google Translate, and a shared love of Japanese pop culture. We laughed at my attempts to try new foods and learn Japanese phrases, and I was delighted to learn more about Japanese culture and customs from them. However, what surprised me the most was how much they wanted to know about me and my life in America. We spent hours talking about everything from music to politics, and I was struck by how curious they were about people from other countries. Reflecting on my experiences with cultural exchange and language, I have come to believe that language is not just a tool for communication, but a means for building understanding and empathy between people from different cultures. In a world that is increasingly divided by politics and ideology, language can serve as a bridge that helps people to see beyond their differences and connect on a human level. As I prepare to apply to college, I am excited about the opportunities that college will provide for me to continue exploring the role of language as a bridge. I am particularly interested in studying a language that is significantly different from English, such as Mandarin or Arabic, in an effort to expand my understanding of cultures that are less familiar to me. I am also eager to participate in cultural exchange programs that will allow me to travel to other countries and build relationships with people from different backgrounds. Ultimately, I hope to use language as a tool to break down barriers and promote understanding and respect between people in my future career, whether that is in diplomacy, international business, or another field that allows me to connect with people from diverse backgrounds. In conclusion, I believe that language has the power to bring people together and build bridges between different cultures. However, it is not enough to simply learn a language- it is essential to approach cultural exchange with an open mind and heart, and a willingness to learn and understand other perspectives. I am excited about the opportunities that college will provide me to continue exploring the role of language as a bridge, and to use my skills and experiences to promote understanding and respect between people from different backgrounds.",0,3.09664132,3.2529858,3.351513708,3.769558175,3.27417776,21.8,26.6,29.0,33.6,27.0
C1,443,"Riding on the subway in Beijing, I feel the penetrating stares of strangers as they spot me--a foreigner. But the word 'foreigner' doesn't define me, it only describes the surface. To truly understand me, these people would have to look beneath the skin and find my passion for language, a passion that has connected me to different cultures throughout my life. My love for languages started with Latin, a language that fostered my admiration for all languages. It's an adventure to translate ancient Latin texts, to perform in a play and watch it at the same time. Reading Virgil's Aeneid, I discovered that I relate to the hero Aeneas. Like him, I value loyalty to friends, family, and society. I stand by my word, and I hold others accountable for theirs. He embarked on a journey to find a new home for his Troy, and I too am on a journey to find my place in the world. Latin paved the way for the lifelong commitment to languages that I have come to cherish. If the strangers on the subway could look deeper into my history, they would know that it was Latin that gave me the passion to learn Spanish, French and Chinese. Spanish never quite absorbed into my memory, and the throaty accents of French were not as appealing as the lyrical tones of Chinese. Chinese was the one language that intrigued me more than any other traditional language. I chose it because I thought it offered endless possibilities to travel to new destinations, meet new people, and experience new cultures. It made me feel whole, like the world of the past was flowing through me alongside the world of the future. Latin provided the doorway to this world of languages. Without words, thoughts and actions would be lost in the space between our ears. Language is the connective tissue that ignites cross-cultural communication. My experiences have taught me that it takes an open mind and heart, a willingness to learn and understand other people's unique perspectives and experiences to truly connect. I learned this on a service trip I made to Honduras when I was 15. Our language skills were limited, but our desire to connect with the locals was strong. We found that we could communicate even in the absence of a shared language, through simple gestures and our shared desire to help others. We had a mutual curiosity about each other's cultures and a shared joy in playing games together. I learned that language proficiency is only part of the connection process. When I visited Japan as part of a student exchange program, I encountered a similar situation. I spoke virtually no Japanese while my host family spoke little English. We had to rely on hand gestures, Google Translate, and their love of J-Pop culture as a bridge. We laughed together over simple misunderstandings and cultural barriers, and I was impressed by just how curious people are about other cultures. Looking ahead, my goal is to take my language skills to the next level by studying a non-Indo-European language like Mandarin or Arabic to gain new perspectives on different cultures. I want to use language to continue building bridges between cultures, to bring people together by showing them the many similarities that we share, and to make language the connective tissue in a world that is so seemingly divided. In conclusion, language is more than just words on a page or sounds in the air--it is the connective tissue that binds us together, allowing us to build bridges that span across cultures to bring people together. It is a tool that must be used with an open mind and heart, a willingness to learn and understand other people's unique perspectives and experiences. Building on my love of languages, I aspire to be a bridge builder in my future career, working to promote mutual understanding and respect through the power of communication.",0,2.713167336,2.893929804,3.047169808,3.339199064,2.987340537,12.0,16.0,21.2,27.6,18.0
C2,444,"As I sit here at my desk, I feel the cool breeze from my open window that carries the scent of wildflowers from the fields outside. The gentle clacking of my keyboard echoes through my room, and my favorite language learning podcast hums in my earbuds. These simple sensations remind me that language is not just a tool but an experience. Language learning is a journey that requires dedication, patience, and an open mind. Like the sound of the wind or the scent of flowers, it evokes emotions and memories that immerse us in a world very different from our own. For me, this journey has been about connecting with other cultures and building empathy, one language at a time. I remember my first trip to Beijing when I arrived at the airport in my weary state, surrounded by a sea of strangers who spoke a language I could not understand. The sounds of chatter and laughter swirled around me, and the hum of the airport intercom created a constant buzz. In that moment, I felt alone and anxious, but also excited to immerse myself in the Chinese language and culture. During my stay in China, I experienced sensory details that allowed me to form a deeper connection with the language. The scent of jasmine trees that lined the streets, the dim lights of the traditional teahouses, and even the rough texture of the Great Wall under my fingers, all began to symbolize my journey. Every sound, sight, taste, and texture helped me to understand the language not just formally but emotionally. These tangible moments on my journey of language learning symbolize the connection that language can bring. When we speak another person's language, we acknowledge their existence and give meaning to their experiences. We show respect for their culture and are willing to step outside of our comfort zones to connect with them at a deeper level. As I look to the future, I know that language will continue to be a way for me to make connections with others. My desire to study non-Indo-European languages like Mandarin or Arabic will push me to new depths and provide me with new ways to express my passion for language. In the end, I know that proficiency in these languages is only one part of the equation. To truly connect with others, I must understand their cultures, traditions, and perspectives. I must be willing to listen, to ask questions, and to learn. Language is about opening doors, not closing them. In conclusion, language is much more than just a tool for communication. It is a journey that evokes the senses and connects us with others. My passion for language drives me to build bridges between different cultures and create meaningful connections. To me, language is the connective tissue that binds us all together, and I am eager to continue exploring the depths of this beautiful, interconnected world.",0,2.522243093,2.728090168,2.983789355,3.212882278,2.878743319,13.0,16.6,20.0,26.0,19.0

C0,446,"It was my senior year of high school, and I had already completed all of my required classes, so I decided to take an art class. I have always been interested in art, and I figured this class would be a good way to develop my skills and explore my creativity. Little did I know, this class would change my perspective on life. On the first day of class, our teacher, Mrs. Johnson, gave us an unexpected directive: she asked us to make art that represented our emotions. I was taken aback. I had always thought of art as a way to create something beautiful, not to express emotions. Nonetheless, I sat down at my table, picked up my pencil and began to draw. As I sat there, I thought about what I was feeling. I thought about the pressures of school, the stress of college applications, and the uncertainty of my future. I was feeling overwhelmed and anxious. I decided to draw a tree, with its roots deep in the ground, but its branches reaching high into the sky. Mrs. Johnson walked around the room and looked at our drawings. When she got to mine, she asked me what it represented. I explained to her that it represented the pressures and stress I was feeling, but that I was determined to push through it and reach for the sky. She smiled and nodded, and moved on to the next student. Over the next few weeks, Mrs. Johnson continued to give us unexpected directives. We made a sculpture out of found objects, painted a portrait of a stranger, and created a piece of art with a partner. With each directive, I felt myself becoming more and more invested in my art. As the semester went on, I found myself looking forward to art class more and more each day. It was a break from the stress of school and college applications, and a chance to express myself in a way that I had never done before. One day, Mrs. Johnson gave us a directive that would change my outlook on life forever. She asked us to make art that represented our growth. At first, I didn't know what to draw. But then, I remembered the tree I had drawn on the first day of class. I decided to draw the same tree, but this time, its branches were fuller, and its leaves were more vibrant. As I drew, I thought about how much I had grown since the start of the semester. I had become more confident in my art, and in myself. I was no longer afraid to express my emotions, and I had learned to appreciate the beauty in imperfection. I started to realize that art was not just about creating something beautiful, but about expressing oneself in a way that can touch others. After class, Mrs. Johnson pulled me aside and told me that my drawing had moved her. She said that she could see the growth and progress that I had made, not just in my art, but in myself. She gave me a book on the history of art and told me to continue exploring my creativity. That day, I left class with a newfound appreciation for art and for life. I realized that art is not just about creating something beautiful, but about expressing oneself in a way that can touch others. I also realized that growth is a process that takes time and effort, and that it can come from unexpected places. As I look back on my art class and the unexpected directives that Mrs. Johnson gave us, I realize that it was more than just a class. It was an experience that taught me to embrace my emotions, appreciate the beauty in imperfection, and to never stop growing. Now, as I apply to college, I realize that my art class will always be a part of me. It has taught me to approach life and challenges with creativity and an open mind. I hope to continue exploring my creativity in college, and to use my experiences to make a positive impact on the world. In conclusion, my unexpected art class directive taught me more about myself and life than I ever thought possible. It taught me the value of expressing oneself through art, the beauty in imperfection, and the importance of growth. I am grateful for the experience and hope to continue exploring my creativity throughout my life.",0,2.496332221,2.670117389,2.838490505,2.982750466,2.74837237,11.4,16.0,19.0,22.0,18.0
C1,447,"The art class I took in my senior year in high school completely transformed my life. Under my teacher, Mrs. Johnson's guidance, I learned to appreciate the power of artistic expression and its ability to connect people in profound ways. What started as a simple request for self-representation became a platform for personal growth and self-discovery. We didn't have any textbooks in the class, and Mrs. Johnson gave us unexpected directives from the very beginning of the course. The first one was to make art that represented our emotions, and I was taken aback. But after putting pencil to paper, I realized how impactful the process of creatively expressing my emotions was. I drew a tree that represented the various pressures I felt, its roots symbolizing my foundation, and its branches reaching upward toward the sky, representing my aspirations. Drawing that picture was the beginning of my artistic journey. Mrs. Johnson's directives were progressive, taking us from sculptures made of found objects to portraits of people we didn't know. Each challenge sparked something new, and I became more curious about how far I could push my imagination. As I embarked on each new journey, I couldn't wait to see where it would lead. One of my favorite directives was to create art with a partner. I enjoyed seeing how collaboration opened up new methods of artistic expression. I was finally able to appreciate how art connected people in unexpected ways, and I also learned that sometimes you have to let someone else take the lead. The project was an excellent reminder that sometimes the best way to learn is to work with someone else. My biggest takeaway from my art class was the importance of growth. We were asked to create art that indicated our growth, and I drew the same tree, but one that had grown fuller and had more vibrant leaves than the one I had created on the first day of class. I discovered that true growth is about steady progress and not necessarily about monumental changes. The tree served as a reminder that it is in the little changes that we find ourselves growing and progressing. In conclusion, my art class with Mrs. Johnson was essential because it opened up a whole new world of creativity to me. Through the directives we were given, I learned how to explore my emotions through art, how collaboration can lead to fantastic results, and that growth is not always immediate, but rather a steady process. I now see art as a valuable form of self-expression and know that even when my creative journey is challenging, it is worth it. As I venture forth into college now, I know that my time in art class played an important role in shaping who I am today.",0,2.663098512,2.792449822,2.912141297,3.474687211,2.803574276,15.4,17.6,20.4,24.6,19.0
C2,448,"The art class was held in the corner of a bright, spacious room. Colorful canvases of different sizes decorated the walls, each painted with its unique style and motif. There were fresh tubs of paints with their unmistakable odors, and soft brushes that created soothing, delicate sounds as they scraped against the palettes. The air was rich with the smell of acrylics and white spirit, which blended to form a distinct scent that filled your chest with a sense of calmness. Mrs. Johnson was nothing like any other teacher I’d encountered before. She was kind, yet firm, had a gentle voice that commanded respect and admiration. She would often wear a large smock of different colors, one for every day of the week, and a smile that lifted your spirit whenever you were working beside her. Her classroom was always serene, almost like entering a sanctuary, yet could be rapturous with jovial laughter and the occasional screams of enthusiasm that would echo across the room. One of my fondest memories in that classroom was watching the afternoon sun cast perfect rays of light across the room, the kind that illuminated everything they touched. Some reflected off the scissors and knives used in our sculptures while others danced on the canvases, giving them life and movement. It was as if the room had gained a soul, and it felt magical. The power of art as a tool for self-discovery was evident in every project we completed. I remember vividly the day I created my sculpture from discarded found objects. It was a jumbled and unremarkable collection of items, yet something about it spoke to me. The way the rusty old watches rested in their excised tea tins, or the shape of the bendy straws created the illusion of a winding serpent, sent ripples of excitement coursing through my veins. It was as if I had discovered something hidden in plain sight. A similar feeling of wonder overcame me when we were asked to paint a portrait of a person we had never met before. I chose someone who looked like they had seen too much hardship and heartbreak, and my painting depicted their sad eyes and tired features. But it was only when I presented it to the class and told the story behind the portrait that everyone broke into applause. And so, through each project that we completed in our art class, I discovered something new about myself. My vision was honed to layer upon layer of emotion and meaning, each project deepening my exploration and discovery. But above all, I learned that the process of creating art was much more than what met the eye. It was about exploring the deepest parts of oneself, about learning to approach life with an open heart and soul, and about discovering how small steps can lead to significant growth. As I move forward toward my future in prestigious college, I will take with me the lessons Mrs. Johnson taught me. I will continue to explore my artistic side, and with each brushstroke and every bit of paint, I will endeavor to discover new depths within myself. My art class was more than just a course; it was a doorway to a better version of myself, and I will always cherish the memories of the transformative journey the class offered to me - be it the vibrant colors that filled the room or the creative freedom that filled my soul.",0,2.63796552,2.961300937,3.272836141,3.391562586,3.000523876,14.0,19.0,23.0,28.0,21.5
H,449,"“Ella, what did you think of Douglass’s view on Christianity?” I gulped. Increasingly powerful palpitations throbbed in my heart as my eyes darted around the classroom – searching for a profound response to Dr. Franklin’s question. I took a deep breath while reaching the most genuine answer I could conjure. “Professor, I don’t know.” Dr. Franklin stared at me blankly as he attempted to interpret the thoughts I didn’t voice. My lack of familiarity with the assigned text wasn’t a consideration that crossed his mind because he was familiar with my past contributions to class discussions. I was a fervent critic of the corrupted culture behind Christianity of the Puritans in Hawthorne’s “Young Goodman Brown” and modern evangelicals involved in the puzzling divinity of Donald Trump. He arched his flummoxed brows as he began to open his mouth. “Professor, what I mean is that I’m not sure whether or not I even have a say on Douglass’s statements on Christianity in his Narrative of the Life.” In class, I often separated the culture of Christianity from the religion. To tie these immensely disparate concepts as one and coin it as Christianity would present fallacies that contradict with the Christianity I knew. Lack of tolerance and hostility were products of humans’ sinful nature – not the teachings of Christ. People were just using Christianity as an excuse to exalt themselves rather than the holy name of Jesus. These were the “facts.” My greatest realization came when Douglass declared Christian slave-holders as the worst slave-holders he ever met because of their deceptive feign of piety and use of Christianity to justify the oppression of their slaves. I realized that I couldn’t bring myself to raise the same argument that I used to convince myself that my Christianity of love was the only true Christianity. To Douglass, Christianity was the opposite. I didn’t want to dismiss his story. People use this sacred religion to spread hatred, and to many, this is the only Christianity they know. Their experiences aren’t any bit falser than mine. Christianity isn’t the only culture that harbors truth that transcends the “facts.” America’s less of a perfect amalgamation of different ethnic cultures and more of a society severed by tribal conflicts rooted in the long established political culture of the nation. Issues such as racism, white privilege, and gender disparity are highly salient topics of current political discussion. However, during a time when people can use online platforms with algorithms that provide content they want to see, we fail to acknowledge the truth in other people’s experiences and express empathy. As a Korean-American in the South, I am no stranger to intolerance. I remember the countless instances of people mocking my parents for their English pronunciation and my brother’s stutter. Because their words were less eloquent, people deemed their thoughts as less valuable as well. I protect my family and translate their words whenever they have a doctor’s appointment or need more ketchup at McDonald’s. My protective nature drives my desire to connect with different people and build understanding. To do so, however, I step outside my Korean American Southern Baptist paradigm because my experiences do not constitute everyone else’s. Excluded from the Manichaean narrative of this country, I observe the turmoil in our nation through a separate lens - a blessing and a curse. Not only do I find myself awkwardly fixed in a black vs. white America, but I also fail to define my identity sandwiched between Korean and American. In the end, I find myself stuck amongst the conventional labels and binaries that divide America. “You seem to work harder than most to understand other people’s points of view,” Dr. Franklin said after I shared these thoughts to the class. “I find this easier because I spent my childhood assuming that my culture was always the exception,” I replied. As an anomaly, accepting different truths is second nature.",1,2.556995705,2.902142143,3.235514551,3.425172724,3.064183265,12.4,17.4,20.6,26.8,18.5
C0,450,"As someone who has grown up in an ethnically diverse family, embracing different cultural perspectives has always come naturally to me. My mother is Korean, while my father is American, and they have always encouraged me to learn about and appreciate both of their cultures. This upbringing has allowed me to recognize the beauty and significance of different cultural perspectives and has inspired me to seek out new experiences and perspectives. In my early childhood, my mother would prepare traditional Korean meals for our family, and we would sit together at the table, chopsticks in hand, trying new foods and learning about their cultural significance. As I grew older, this same curiosity led me to take a class on Korean culture in middle school, where I learned about the influence of Confucianism on Korean society and the importance of filial piety for Korean families. This experience fueled my desire to learn more about different cultures and to explore the ways in which cultural beliefs and practices shape our world. One of the ways in which I have broadened my cultural horizons is through travel. In the summer before my junior year of high school, I had the opportunity to visit Japan on a school trip. My previous experiences with different cultures had been limited to Korean-American traditions, so I was excited to learn about the customs and practices unique to Japan. I was struck by the beauty of their temples and shrines, the intricacy of their art and architecture, and the gentleness of their people. Throughout the trip, I was amazed at how much I learned about the Japanese people's beliefs, values, and way of life, and how much these learnings enriched my own cultural background. Another way in which I have embraced different cultural perspectives is through my academic studies. In my English class this year, we read Toni Morrison's 'Beloved,' which explores the experiences of African Americans in the post-Civil War era. Through the novel, I gained a new understanding of the struggles and suffering that this community has faced in American history. I realized that reading literature from different cultural perspectives is a powerful way to engage with the experiences of others and learn about their histories and cultures. I increasingly understood that by reading and listening, I could gain a deeper appreciation of the diversity of human experiences, and I sought to incorporate these insights into my own life. Furthermore, taking the initiative to attend a Spanish language course showed me that it is impossible to separate language from culture. In the process, I discovered the ways in which the Spanish language embodies key aspects of Spanish culture. I learned how to navigate the intricacies and etiquette of Spanish-speaking societies, including the importance of family and relationships. Additionally, attending monthly cultural festivals within our city has provided me with an opportunity to see firsthand the ways that individuals connect with their cultural heritage in everyday life. In this time of heightened global connectivity, embracing different cultural perspectives is more critical than ever before. Our communities are more diverse than ever, and to work together effectively, we must be able to understand and appreciate each other's perspectives. The ability to communicate effectively with people of different cultural backgrounds, the capacity to empathize and understand the traditions, beliefs, and values of others, and one’s capacity to be flexible and adaptive is critical for building bridges between different communities. This capacity is particularly important when it comes to political discussions. Political discourse can be divisive, and it is easy for people to become entrenched in their beliefs and disengage from others. However, if we can work to understand others' perspectives and engage in dialogue, we are more likely to build consensus and work effectively towards our common goals. In conclusion, embracing different cultural perspectives has been an essential part of my personal journey. As a result, I have gained a broad appreciation for the diverse communities that have shaped and continue to shape our world. Travel, literature, language learning, attending cultural events, and engagement with different communities are all powerful tools for broadening one's cultural horizons. I am confident that by continuing to embrace and learn from different cultural perspectives, I will become a more effective global citizen, with the skills and understanding required to work effectively across cultures to create a more equitable and peaceful world. It is this mindset that will enable me to thrive at Yale, and to leave a lasting impact in its intellectual community.",0,3.010459292,3.180777532,3.356922516,3.63863078,3.219852979,19.0,21.0,24.0,29.0,23.0

C2,452,"As I sat down with Dr. Franklin, the screeching sound of chairs being adjusted and the tapping of pencils against tables filled the air. Dr. Franklin posed a question about Douglass's view on Christianity, and I realized the depth of my ignorance on the topic. I sat in stunned silence. My classmates were actively participating and engaging in the discussion while I remained subdued, frustrated with my lack of knowledge. This experience has taught me that there is always more to learn, and it is essential to maintain an open mind to new perspectives. This realization dates back to my childhood, when my mother used to encourage me to read books for pleasure. I remember the musty smell of the library, the scratchy texture of the pages, and the weight of each book in my hands. I would dive into each one, losing myself in the story and discovering new worlds. As I grew older, I realized that these books were essential in exposing me to different perspectives, cultures, and realities. Reading helped me develop critical thinking skills, empathy, and a deep appreciation for diversity. In high school, I continued to explore different perspectives by volunteering at a local soup kitchen. The smoky aroma of soup, the sound of metal spoons clattering against plates, and people laughing echoed in the air. I worked alongside individuals from diverse backgrounds, and through this experience, I learned the importance of listening to the stories of others and learning from their unique experiences.

H,453,"The best compliment I ever received was from my little brother: “My science teacher’s unbelievably good at telling stories,” he announced. “Nearly as good as you.” I thought about that, how I savor a good story the way some people savor last-minute touchdowns. I learned in biology that I’m composed of 7 × 10 27 atoms, but that number didn’t mean anything to me until I read Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything. One sentence stayed with me for weeks: “Every atom you possess has almost certainly passed through several stars and been part of millions of organisms on its way to becoming you.” It estimates that each human has about 2 billion atoms of Shakespeare hanging around inside—quite a comfort, as I try to write this essay. I thought about every one of my atoms, wondering where they had been and what miracles they had witnessed. My physical body is a string of atoms, but what of my inner self, my soul, my essence? I’ve come to the realization that my life has been a string as well, a string of stories. Every one of us is made of star stuff, forged through fires, and emerging as nicked as the surface of the moon. It frustrated me no end that I couldn’t sit down with all the people I met, interrogating them about their lives, identifying every last story that made them who they are. I remember how magical it was the first time I read a fiction book: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone. I was duly impressed with Quidditch and the Invisibility Cloak, of course, but I was absolutely spellbound by how much I could learn about Harry. The kippers he had for breakfast, the supplies he bought for Potions—the details everyone skimmed over were remarkable to me. Fiction was a revelation. Here, at last, was a window into another person’s string of stories! Over the years, I’ve thought long and hard about that immortal question: What superpower would you choose? I considered the usual suspects—invisibility, superhuman strength, flying—but threw them out immediately. My superhero alter ego would be Story Girl. She wouldn’t run marathons, but she could walk for miles and miles in other people’s shoes. She’d know that all it takes for empathy and understanding is the right story. Imagine my astonishment when I discovered Radiolab on NPR. Here was my imaginary superpower, embodied in real life! I had been struggling with AP Biology, seeing it as a class full of complicated processes and alien vocabulary. That changed radically when I listened, enthralled, as Radiolab traced the effects of dopamine on love and gambling. This was science, sure, but it was science as I’d never heard it before. It contained conflict and emotion and a narrative; it made me anxious to learn more. It wasn’t that I was obtuse for biology; I just hadn’t found the stories in it before. I’m convinced that you can learn anything in the form of a story. The layperson often writes off concepts—entropy, the Maginot Line, anapestic meter—as too foreign to comprehend. But with the right framing, the world suddenly becomes an open book, enticing and ripe for exploration. I want to become a writer to find those stories, much like Jad Abumrad and Robert Krulwich from Radiolab, making intimidating subjects become familiar and inviting for everyone. I want to become Story Girl.",1,2.489073637,2.739652665,2.901160305,3.20600522,2.826464635,12.0,16.0,18.0,22.0,17.0
C0,454,"I had always enjoyed books as a child. As a young girl, the stories my parents read me were my only escape from the world I inhabited. I was shy and introverted, and unable to make friends with the kids around me. But when I read stories, I felt like I was transported to a different world. That feeling never left me, and as I grew older, I realized that storytelling had the power to influence our lives in a myriad of ways. As I entered my teenage years, I became more interested in the stories of individuals. I read about people who had survived tragedies and turned their pain into art. I was captivated by the works of authors who had wrestled with mental illness and addiction but had come out the other side. I was fascinated by people whose bravery and resilience had enabled them to accomplish incredible feats. These stories shaped my understanding of the world around me and helped me develop empathy for people whose experiences were vastly different from my own. The power of storytelling became especially clear to me when I started volunteering at a local hospital. I was assigned to work with patients in the oncology ward, and at first, I didn't know how to approach them. But one day, I decided to bring a book with me and read to a patient who was undergoing chemotherapy. I didn't expect much, but afterwards, she told me that listening to the story had helped distract her from her pain. She asked me to come back and read to her again, and soon I found myself reading to several patients each week. It was interesting to see how different people responded to the same stories - some found comfort in tales of hope and redemption, while others preferred stories that were funny and lighthearted. The experience of reading to patients at the hospital taught me that storytelling doesn't just have the power to entertain or educate; it can also comfort and heal. I realized that I wanted to pursue this passion further, and over the next few years, I took classes that focused on writing and literature. I studied journalism and creative writing, and even started writing my own short stories. I was fascinated by the idea that a single individual's narrative could have the power to influence people on a large scale. As I began to explore the world of storytelling more deeply, I came to appreciate the diversity of voices and perspectives that were out there. In particular, I became interested in stories that were often overlooked or ignored. I read books by authors from marginalized communities, and I was struck by how these stories had the power to challenge and change the dominant narrative. I realized that the stories we choose to tell - and the stories we choose to ignore - have a profound impact on the way we understand ourselves and the world around us. This realization led me to create a literary magazine at my high school. I wanted to provide a platform for students to share their own stories, no matter how unconventional or uncomfortable they might be. I approached people from different backgrounds and asked them to submit their work - poetry, prose, essays, and even artwork. The response was overwhelming, and soon we had a full issue's worth of submissions. The magazine ended up being a success, and it made me realize that storytelling could be a tool for social justice. I started reading more about the power of narrative in activism and social movements. I learned about how marginalized communities have been historically silenced and how storytelling can change this oppression. I started to understand that storytelling has the power to disturb the status quo and to bring about meaningful societal change. As I look back over my past few years, I see how storytelling has brought me to where I am today. It has helped me find my voice and my passion, and it has opened my eyes to the possibilities that exist in the world. As I look ahead to college, I hope to continue exploring this power of storytelling. I want to deepen my understanding of narrative and learn how it can be used to create social change. I want to work with others to ensure that all voices are heard, and that stories from all perspectives are given equal weight. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and what stories I will discover along the way.",0,2.675028196,2.829900505,3.002796942,3.128167333,2.896189401,15.0,19.0,21.0,24.6,20.5
C1,455,"I come from a family of immigrants. My parents moved to the United States with nothing but the clothes on their backs and the hope of a better life. As a child, I was surrounded by the stories of their struggles and triumphs - tales of perseverance, hard work, and the strength of the human spirit. These stories have become a part of who I am, shaping my worldview and instilling in me a deep appreciation for the power of storytelling. As I grew older, I began to explore the world of storytelling beyond my family's tales. I devoured books, movies, and TV shows, and I loved the way a good story could transport me to a different world or make me see my own life through new eyes. I became interested in writing my own stories, and I poured my heart and soul into creating characters and worlds that felt real to me. But as much as I loved fiction, I came to realize that real-life stories had an even more profound impact on me. I started reading memoirs and autobiographies, and I was struck by how these stories could be so raw and honest. These writers bared their souls on the page, sharing their joys and sorrows, their failures and victories. I was moved by the courage it took to share such personal stories with the world, and I wanted to do the same. So, I started writing my own nonfiction. At first, it was just for myself - a way to make sense of my own experiences and emotions. But as I shared my writing with others, I realized how powerful it could be. People told me that my stories had resonated with them, that they had seen themselves reflected in my words. It was a revelation to me - I had always known that stories could be entertaining or informative, but I hadn't fully grasped how they could connect us on a deeper, more human level. My interest in storytelling led me to pursue journalism in high school, and I began writing for the school newspaper. I loved the challenge of finding the stories that other people might overlook - the parts of our community that were hidden in the shadows. It was difficult work, but it was also deeply rewarding. Seeing my stories in print - stories that had the potential to inform and inspire my peers - was one of the most gratifying experiences of my life. As I prepare to apply to colleges, storytelling is at the forefront of my mind. I want to attend a school that will challenge me to explore the power of narrative in all its forms - fiction, nonfiction, journalism, and more. I want to study under professors who are passionate about storytelling and who will help me hone my craft. And most of all, I want to be part of a community of students who share my love for stories and who are committed to using them to change the world. I know that storytelling is not just a hobby or a passion for me - it is a calling. I want to use the power of narrative to shed light on social issues, to bring attention to people who are normally ignored, and to give voice to those who have been silenced. I believe that storytelling can be a force for positive change in our world, and I am eager to explore all the different ways that it can be used to make a difference. As I sit down to write my college essays, I am grateful for the stories that have brought me here. I am humbled by the courage of those who have shared their own stories with me, and I am inspired to continue the tradition of storytelling for generations to come. I may not know what the future holds, but I know that I want to be part of a community that values the power of narrative; a community that uses its stories to make a difference.",0,2.605290361,2.953101609,3.103441258,3.226245228,3.046777936,16.8,20.0,25.0,30.2,22.0
C2,456,"I remember the day my father took me to his factory for the first time. The hum of the machines was overwhelming, even as he shouted over them to introduce me to his coworkers - men and women who, like him, had left their homes and families behind in search of a better life. I shook their calloused hands and felt the fabric of their work uniforms rough against my skin. The smell of steel and oil filled my nostrils, and the heat of the machines warmed my cheeks. As I grew older, I understood more about the sacrifice these workers had made. I saw my father come home exhausted after a long day of work, his stained hands shaking as he ate his dinner. But I also saw the pride in his eyes when he talked about the factory - how, with hard work and determination, he had climbed the ranks from the bottom, earning the respect of his colleagues and the success of his business. My father's story is just one of the many that inspired me to become a writer. I am drawn to stories of resilience, stories of people who overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles to achieve their dreams. These stories have shaped my own worldview, teaching me that anything is possible with hard work and a little bit of grit. That is why I am so excited to apply to Yale and Harvard - two schools that embrace the power of storytelling in their academics and campus culture. From the historical buildings that line the streets of Cambridge to the bustling city of New Haven, both universities are steeped in a rich tradition of stories. But it is not just the physical environment that inspires me - it is the commitment to using storytelling to enact change. One example of this commitment can be found in the Pulitzer Prize-winning authors who have studied and taught at these universities, from Toni Morrison to John Updike. These writers have used their craft to explore themes like race, class, and identity, elevating the voices of those who have been marginalized by society. As a student, I would be honored to learn from such luminaries, and to use their example to shape my own writing. But storytelling is not just limited to the classroom - it is also a vital part of the extracurricular life at Yale and Harvard. From student publications like the Harvard Crimson to theater groups like the Yale Dramat, there are countless opportunities for students to hone their craft and connect with others who share their passion. I could see myself immersing myself in these communities, learning from my peers and contributing my own unique voice to the campus dialogue. Of course, attending Yale or Harvard would not just be a chance for me to write - it would also be a chance for me to grow as a person. As someone who comes from a family of immigrants, I am acutely aware of the importance of diversity and cultural understanding. Both universities have shown a commitment to these values through their international populations and their emphasis on community service. I believe that being a part of such a community would challenge me to broaden my horizons and deepen my empathy for others. In conclusion, my journey to becoming a writer has been shaped by the stories of those around me - from my family's immigration narrative to the stories of resilience and triumph that I have encountered in my reading. I know that attending Yale or Harvard would provide me with the tools and experiences I need to continue my storytelling journey, and to use my writing to make a difference in the world. Whether exploring the gritty details of factory life or using my voice to speak truth to power, I am eager to embrace the power of storytelling as I navigate this next chapter of my life.",0,2.880039405,3.040471484,3.364498471,3.758259504,3.298280479,19.0,22.0,25.0,32.0,23.0
H,457,"I hate the letter “S”. Of the 164,777 words with “S”, I only grapple with one. To condemn an entire letter because of its use 0.0006% of the time sounds statistically absurd, but that one case changed 100% of my life. I used to have two parents, but now I have one, and the “S” in “parents” isn’t going anywhere. “S” follows me. I can’t get through a day without being reminded that while my friends went out to dinner with their parents, I ate with my parent. As I write this essay, there is a blue line under the word “parent” telling me to check my grammar; even Grammarly assumes that I should have parents, but cancer doesn’t listen to edit suggestions. I won’t claim that my situation is as unique as 1 in 164,777, but it is still an exception to the rule - an outlier. The world isn’t meant for this special case. The world wouldn’t abandon “S” because of me, so I tried to abandon “S”. I could get away from “S” if I stayed busy; you can’t have dinner with your “parent” (thanks again, Grammarly) if you’re too busy to have family dinner. Any spare time that I had, I filled. I became known as the “busy kid”- the one that everyone always asks, “How do you have time?” Morning meetings, classes, after school meetings, volleyball practice, dance class, rehearsal in Boston, homework, sleep, repeat. Though my specific schedule has changed over time, the busyness has not. I couldn’t fill the loss that “S” left in my life, but I could at least make sure I didn’t have to think about it. There were so many things in my life that I couldn’t control, so I controlled what I could- my schedule. I never succumbed to the stress of potentially over-committing. I thrived. It became a challenge to juggle it all, but I’d soon find a rhythm. But rhythm wasn’t what I wanted. Rhythm may not have an “S”, but “S” sure liked to come by when I was idle. So, I added another ball, and another, and another. Soon I noticed that the same “color” balls kept falling into my hands- theater, academics, politics. I began to want to come into contact with these more and more, so I further narrowed the scope of my color wheel and increased the shades of my primary colors. Life became easier to juggle, but for the first time, I didn’t add another ball. I found my rhythm, and I embraced it. I stopped running away from a single “S” and began chasing a double “S”- passion. Passion has given me purpose. I was shackled to “S” as I tried to escape the confines of the traditional familial structure. No matter how far I ran, “S” stayed behind me because I kept looking back. I’ve finally learned to move forward instead of away, and it is liberating. “S” got me moving, but it hasn’t kept me going. I wish I could end here, triumphant and basking in my new inspiration, but life is more convoluted. Motivation is a double edged sword; it keeps me facing forward, but it also keeps me from having to look back. I want to claim that I showed courage in being able to turn from “S”, but I cannot. Motivation is what keeps “S” at bay. I am not perfectly healed, but I am perfect at navigating the best way to heal me. I don’t seek out sadness, so “S” must stay on the sidelines, and until I am completely ready, motivation is more than enough for me.",1,2.230513333,2.476420704,2.69142227,2.996453418,2.588746786,8.0,13.8,17.0,25.0,15.0
C0,458,"As I stood at my grandmother's graveside, tears streaming down my face, I felt alone and broken. My grandmother had been one of the most important people in my life, and now she was gone. I didn't know how I was going to get through each day without her. Grief is not the kind of thing that you can simply get over. It's not something that you can just move on from. It's a process of healing that takes time and effort. For me, loss and grief have been an integral part of my life. I have lost many people that I have loved, including both of my grandfathers and my uncle. Each time, the pain was intense, but it was also different. With each loss, I learned something new about myself and about the world. The first time I experienced grief was when my grandfather passed away. It was the first time I had ever lost someone close to me. I was young and didn't quite understand what was happening. I remember feeling numb and disconnected from the world around me. For a long time, I didn't know how to talk about my grief, and I felt like nobody could understand what I was going through. But over time, I began to navigate through the grief. I discovered that talking about my feelings helped me to process my emotions and understand that others who have gone through this have some sense of what I'm feeling. I became involved in support groups at school and found solace in sharing my experiences with others who had also experienced loss. When I lost my grandmother, however, the experience was different. Unlike my grandfather's death, I was not a child anymore- I understood the finality of death, and what this loss meant to me and to my family. For a long time, I tried to bury my emotions and put on a brave face for my family, but it wasn't until I confronted my grief head-on that I was able to begin the healing process. Through the pain of losing so many significant people in my life, I discovered that grief is not something that you can just 'get over.' It's something that takes time and effort to work through. But the beautiful thing is that with time and effort, healing will happen. What's more, you will come out stronger, with a deeper understanding of yourself and the world around you. As I struggled with my grief, I also began to notice how people handle other significant problems. I witnessed a friend experiencing anxiety and depression and couldn't help but draw parallels between grief and the experience of depression. They both require support from others, work and effort to overcome, and the realization that healing is a journey, rather than an instant breakthrough. Similarly, I learned that no two people experience grief the same way. While my grief ebbed and flowed, my mother's was entirely different, even though we were both mourning the same person. Learning that each person has their journey gave me the strength to respect everyone's journey, empathize better, and to encourage others wherever possible. Through the process of grieving and healing, I also discovered the importance of perseverance. Losing someone may never become easy, but it is a process that we must work through. Even on days when it feels impossible, we need to keep going, one day at a time, and eventually, we'll come out the other side. In conclusion, my experiences with grief have taught me many things about myself and the world around me. I have learned that grief is a process that we must work through, often with the support of our loved ones. I have learned that each person's journey is unique and should be respected, and that perseverance is essential in moving through the cycle of healing. My experiences have also made me more empathetic and supportive of others as they navigate their own struggles. I hope to bring this understanding with me to college and to continue to help support others as they work through their own pain in what ways I can.",0,2.261263304,2.541138769,2.736161365,2.950732989,2.609655286,11.6,14.0,18.0,24.4,17.0
C1,459,"The pangs of grief are universal. We all experience losing someone close to us, be it a family member, a friend or an admired co-worker. The pain of losing someone close to you is piercingly palpable - it is a dark, all-encompassing feeling that takes hold of us, and the road to recovery is long and fraught with difficulty. My personal journey with grief started when I lost my grandfather. The loss was sudden and unexpected. At the time, I was too young to understand the weight of the loss, but it did bury itself deep within me. It wasn't until I lost my uncle many years later that I began to comprehend the nuances of the grieving process. Suddenly, the emotions my young self had repressed surfaced, and I began to feel deeply. I searched for ways to cope and heal during that period, and in so doing, discovered the importance of acknowledging my emotions and finding people to share them with. It was a painful learning process that I still follow - If I am going through a period of loss, I do not try to push them down or mask them with other activities but instead, allow myself to feel the fullness of those emotions. When my grandmother passed away, I had a more mature understanding of what grief and loss meant; that it is a journey and not merely an event. Through this process, I have learned that one of the best ways to navigate grief is to create stability in your life. For me, that was the person I had always relied on, my mother. Together, we helped each other survive the immediate trauma, and then we looked for moments of peace. Those moments looked different for both of us. For my mother, it was church concerts and being outdoors, and for me, it was getting involved in supportive communities that helped me process my emotions. I understand that grief affects everyone differently, and I try to be sensitive to this fact. Sometimes, empathy is difficult, but it is essential in supporting people through difficult times. That is why for me, being a supportive friend or colleague is vital in ensuring that people feel encouraged and uplifted when going through the process of healing. Writing this essay wasn’t easy because the more I delved into the topic, the more memories surfaced. The sheer magnitude of the emotions that are attached to grief is overwhelming, but it is also necessary to feel them. By expressing and sharing your feelings and vulnerabilities with others, we can help ourselves on the road to recovery by understanding that we are not alone. In these moments, it's essential to find the thing that motivates you, to push through those hard times, and to remember that healing is a journey. In conclusion, grief is a journey, and that journey is different for everyone. It is up to us individually to find the best way to navigate our grief and to lean on supportive communities or individuals when we need them most. We may never 'get over' the loss of someone dear to us, but the sorrow will ease over time. How we manage that grief is essential in determining how long that healing process will take. By acknowledging our emotions and surrounding ourselves with people who care, encouraging us to look towards a brighter future, we can ensure that the healing process is as healthy as possible.",0,2.473950397,2.601483037,2.85960505,3.139715744,2.701447564,13.4,17.0,22.0,27.6,20.0
C2,460,"The smell of freshly brewed coffee permeates the air as I take my seat at my favorite table, my laptop in hand. This coffee shop is my safe haven, my go-to when I need to process or write out my emotions. The comforting buzz of chatter, the occasional clink of a cup on a saucer, and the whir of blenders crafting smoothies all form a familiar background noise. It's a subtle, calming environment. It's here that I find myself processing one of the most difficult grief experiences - the loss of my grandfather. I remember the initial confusion and fear as family members huddled in my grandparents' home, their faces etched in grief. As a young child at the time, I was aware that something significant had happened. Yet, I did not grasp the gravity of that one moment. Years later, when my uncle passed away, grief became more real. I witnessed the deep sorrow in his wife's eyes as she remembered their time together, and it was then that the emotions I hadn't allowed myself to feel during my grandfather's passing broke through. They hit me like a ton of bricks. I was in shock and denial for days, unable to comprehend that another important person in my life was gone. My world was colored by shades of sadness and uncertainty. It was in this moment that I turned to my community for support. A closed group of friends, family members, and co-workers served as my rock. They listened, offered a shoulder to cry on, and gave sage advice. Together, we formed a collective group of individuals experiencing the same emotions, expressing grief in ways that were uniquely our own. Yet, together, we formed a bond that would carry us through our grief, helping us process and heal. As time passed, the healing journey became about rediscovering life's stability. I found myself turning towards my mother - a constant pillar of support in my life. We turned towards each other, sewing ourselves together to form a protective shield, where we could face the inevitable emotions of the grieving journey together. We sought moments of peace in different ways, like church concerts or group walks, finding small moments of happiness that helped us on the journey towards healing. Throughout this journey, I've come to understand the importance of empathy. In the same way, my support system helped me, I make a conscious effort to do the same for others. Empathy is about understanding that people are all different and we express this emotion over time in differing ways. It's about being sensitive to what helps them heal and doing whatever we can to support them in that process. It's not always straightforward, but it is essential in providing the support that individuals need to recover. As I knock off the last line in this essay, I can feel a sense of peace settling around me. The lingering smell of coffee, the gentle chatter and subtle buzz of the cafe's environment brings a sense of comfort. I am reminded that my healing journey will always be ongoing, and that's okay. By acknowledging my emotions and being open to expressing them, by leaning on supportive individuals and communities, and by striving to show empathy for others, I take another step forward. In conclusion, grief is not an event, but rather, a journey. It's different for everyone, and each of us must figure out the best way to navigate our emotions. The support of individuals and communities plays a significant part in helping us through the process, whether it is by offering a listening ear or accompanying us to activities that help ease the pain. By practicing empathy, showing sensitivity to what others need to heal, we can stand beside those who grieve, offering comfort and uplifting them in moments of vulnerability. It is our connection with others that brings us closer to the ultimate goal of healing.",0,2.472338507,2.586469058,2.749070258,3.156117841,2.695143234,11.0,16.0,20.0,22.0,18.5
H,461,"I have a fetish for writing. I’m not talking about crafting prose or verses, or even sentences out of words. But simply constructing letters and characters from strokes of ink gives me immense satisfaction. It’s not quite calligraphy, as I don’t use calligraphic pens or Chinese writing brushes; I prefer it simple, spontaneous, and subconscious. I often find myself crafting characters in the margins of notebooks with a fifty-cent pencil, or tracing letters out of thin air with anything from chopsticks to fingertips. The art of handwriting is a relic in the information era. Why write when one can type? Perhaps the Chinese had an answer before the advent of keyboards. 'One’s handwriting,' said the ancient Chinese, 'is a painting of one’s mind.' After all, when I practice my handwriting, I am crafting characters. My character. I particularly enjoy meticulously designing a character, stroke by stroke, and eventually building up, letter by letter, to a quote personalized in my own voice. Every movement of the pen and every droplet of ink all lead to something profound, as if the arches of every 'm' are doorways to revelations. After all, characters are the building blocks of language, and language is the only vehicle through which knowledge unfolds. Thus, in a way, these letters under my pen are themselves representations of knowledge, and the delicate beauty of every letter proves, visually, the intrinsic beauty of knowing. I suppose handwriting reminds me of my conviction in this visual manner: through learning answers are found, lives enriched, and societies bettered. Moreover, perhaps this strange passion in polishing every single character of a word delineates my dedication to learning, testifies my zeal for my conviction, and sketches a crucial stroke of my character. 'We—must—know . . .' the mathematician David Hilbert’s voice echoes in resolute cursive at the tip of my pen, as he, addressing German scientists in 1930, propounds the goal of modern intellectuals. My pen firmly nods in agreement with Hilbert, while my mind again fumbles for the path to knowledge. The versatility of handwriting enthralls me. The Chinese developed many styles—called hands—of writing. Fittingly, each hand seems to parallel one of my many academic interests. Characters of the Regular Hand (kai shu), a legible script, serve me well during many long hours when I scratch my head and try to prove a mathematical statement rigorously, as the legibility illuminates my logic on paper. Words of the Running Hand (xing shu), a semi-cursive script, are like the passionate words that I speak before a committee of Model United Nations delegates, propounding a decisive course of action: the words, both spoken and written, are swift and coherent but resolute and emphatic. And strokes of the Cursive Hand (cao shu) resemble those sudden artistic sparks when I deliver a line on stage: free, spontaneous, but emphatic syllables travel through the lights like rivers of ink flowing on the page. Yet the fact that the three distinctive hands cooperate so seamlessly, fusing together the glorious culture of writing, is perhaps a fable of learning, a testament that the many talents of the Renaissance Man could all be worthwhile for enriching human society. Such is my methodology: just like I organize my different hands into a neat personal style with my fetish for writing, I can unify my broad interests with my passion for learning. '. . . We—will—know!' Hilbert finishes his adage, as I frantically slice an exclamation mark as the final stroke of this painting of my mind. I must know: for knowing, like well-crafted letters, has an inherent beauty and an intrinsic value. I will know: for my versatile interests in academics will flow like my versatile styles of writing. I must know and I will know: for my fetish for writing is a fetish for learning.",1,2.3585467,2.640882022,3.032494888,3.550157149,2.947196018,6.0,13.2,19.8,28.4,17.0
C0,462,"As a high school senior, I have a distinct passion for handwriting and learning. It's something that I've been interested in for as long as I can remember, and it's possible that it all stems from the fact that my handwriting has always been less than impeccable. Despite this, I've worked hard over the years to improve my handwriting, and it has become my true passion. As a young student in elementary school, I would spend countless hours practicing my letters, using the old big-lined paper that teachers would hand out to every student. According to many teachers I had, my handwriting needed a lot of work, so I made it my personal mission to improve. It was difficult, but I was committed to the process, and in time, I managed to improve to the point that my teachers would commend my work in front of my classmates. As I got older, I continued to see handwriting as a passion, and it eventually turned into something much more than an obsession with letter formation. I truly began to understand the importance of handwriting and the role that it plays in learning, comprehension, and memory retention. For me, there's something about jotting down notes in class or writing out an essay that really helps me to focus and absorb information more effectively. It's as though the act of writing stimulates the mind and helps to create meaningful connections within the brain that make studying and learning so much more manageable. This is why I always incorporate handwriting in my studying process whenever possible, and it's the reason why I've learned to appreciate the history of handwriting and the power it has had throughout human history. In fact, I've worked hard to understand the true art of handwriting, and it has become a beautiful way for me to express myself, both academically and personally. There's something about swirly letters, cursive writing, and the beautiful arc of a well-formed capital 'L' that just soothes my soul. I also find it fascinating that handwriting can reveal so much about a person's character, mood, and emotions. It's almost as though each stroke of the pen tells a story about the individual who wrote it. As a result, I've come to appreciate that handwriting is more than just a means to an end; it's an art form that reveals so much about a person's identity and personal history. All of these experiences and passions have led me to be a fervent advocate for the use of cursive handwriting in schools. In an age where technology has become so ubiquitous, we sometimes overlook the value that pen and paper have in the learning process. I believe that there's something special about writing that can't be replicated by typing, and we should encourage younger generations to learn and appreciate this art form. In conclusion, my passion for handwriting and learning has helped me to realize the true beauty of the written word. Writing has become so much more than a chore or an assignment to complete; it's a true passion that has helped me to focus and learn more effectively. I've come to appreciate the history of handwriting, the way in which it stimulates the mind, and how it reveals something personal about each writer. Because of this, I've become an advocate for cursive handwriting in schools, and I hope to continue to foster a love of this beautiful art form in others. As I look toward the future, I hope to use this passion for handwriting and learning to help make a difference in the world. Whether it's through writing essays or teaching others to appreciate the beauty of handwriting, I know that this passion will propel me forward in all of my future endeavors. It's my unique take on the role of handwriting in our lives that sets me apart from others and makes me a truly unique candidate for top universities like Yale or Harvard.",0,2.882680772,3.067355939,3.169944596,3.388585399,3.1149853,21.0,24.0,28.0,29.0,26.0
C1,463,"In an age where technology has consumed our lives and writing has become almost obsolete, I find it ironic that my passion for handwriting has grown stronger. Although it may seem like an unnecessary skill, I take pride in being able to craft letters with intricate detail and precision. My love for handwriting goes beyond the aesthetic appeal and physical motion, it is a fundamental part of my personal and academic development. As a high school senior, my writing skills have developed into a way for me to express myself and my ideas. I have become more efficient in organizing my thoughts and ideas on paper, and I attribute much of this growth to my appreciation for handwriting. Each letter that I write has meaning and purpose, no matter how insignificant it may seem. Writing by hand forces me to slow down and think critically about what I am writing, allowing me to absorb and process information more seamlessly. Furthermore, I strongly believe that handwriting is an art form that must be preserved. There is something romantic about seeing an entire page filled with carefully crafted letters and words. It is fascinating to watch the ink flow across the paper, creating a personalized masterpiece with each stroke of the pen. In a world where everything is digitized, I find comfort in knowing that handwriting can create a uniquely personal connection between the writer and their work. In addition to personal expression, handwriting has played a significant role in my academic development. As a young child, I struggled with dyslexia and ADHD, which made it difficult to read and write. However, through years of practice and dedication, I improved my handwriting skills, which had a great impact on my academic work. Writing by hand gave me a sense of control, focus, and discipline. It allowed me to organize my thoughts and ideas coherently, which ultimately improved my grades and performance. As I progressed through my academic career, my passion for handwriting opened the door to new interests and perspectives. For instance, I became fascinated with the history and cultural significance of Chinese calligraphy. The intricacy and beauty of Chinese characters inspired me to learn more about the language and its symbolism. Each character depicted a unique story, and every stroke of the brush contributed to the meaning and emotion behind the words. It is remarkable how writing can connect us to different cultures and give us a glimpse into the past. Despite the beauty and significance of handwriting, many people have deemed it irrelevant in today's society. Between laptops, tablets, and smartphones, writing by hand has become less common, but I believe that it should not be forgotten. Instead, we should continue to pass down the skills and traditions of handwriting to future generations. It is a critical part of our cultural heritage and adds vibrancy and depth to our personal and academic lives. In conclusion, my passion for handwriting has become one of the defining features of my character. It has given me a sense of purpose, discipline, and creativity. I believe that handwriting is a crucial part of our humanity that should not be ignored or dismissed. Instead, we should celebrate its artistry and significance and continue to pass down the tradition to future generations.

As well as being an aesthetic pastime, handwriting is a fundamental part of my personal and academic development, allowing me to express myself creatively, efficiently, and thoughtfully. I am captivated by the details and precision that handwriting requires, and I take pride in being able to create letters that combine beauty and function. Each letter that I write has meaning and purpose that goes beyond mere scribbles on a page. When writing by hand, I can pour my heart and soul onto paper, articulating my thoughts and feelings seamlessly.

Each character has a unique story to tell and intricate details that make them majestic. It is remarkable how this age-old artwork can connect to different cultures and give us a glimpse into the past. Writing by hand has become less modernized in modern times, which is a shame in my opinion. It creates a lovely balance between technology and humanity.

H,465,"When I was a child, I begged my parents for my very own Brother PT-1400 P-Touch Handheld Label Maker to fulfill all of my labeling needs. Other kids had Nintendos and would spend their free time with Mario and Luigi. While they pummeled their video game controllers furiously, the pads of their thumbs dancing across their joysticks, I would type out labels on my industrial-standard P-Touch with just as much zeal. I labeled everything imaginable, dividing hundreds of pens into Ziploc bags by color, then rubber-banding them by point size. The finishing touch, of course, was always a glossy, three-eighths-inch-wide tag, freshly churned out from my handheld labeler and decisively pasted upon the numerous plastic bags I had successfully compiled. Labeling became therapeutic for me; organizing my surroundings into specific groups to be labeled provides me with a sense of stability. I may not physically need the shiny color-coded label verifying the contents of a plastic bag as BLUE HIGHLIGHTERS—FAT, to identify them as such, but seeing these classifications so plainly allows me to appreciate the reliability of my categorizations. There are no exceptions when I label the top ledge of my bookshelf as containing works from ACHEBE, CHINUA TO CONRAD, JOSEPH. Each book is either filtered into that category or placed definitively into another one. Yet, such consistency only exists in these inanimate objects. Thus, the break in my role as a labeler comes when I interact with people. Their lives are too complicated, their personalities too intricate for me to resolutely summarize in a few words or even with the 26.2 feet of laminated adhesive tape compatible with my label maker. I have learned that a thin line exists between labeling and just being judgmental when evaluating individuals. I can hardly superficially characterize others as simply as I do my material possessions because people refuse to be so cleanly separated and compartmentalized. My sister Joyce jokes freely and talks with me for hours about everything from the disturbing popularity of vampires in pop culture to cubic watermelons, yet those who don’t know her well usually think of her as timid and introverted. My mother is sometimes my biggest supporter, spouting words of encouragement and, at other instances, my most unrelenting critic. The overlap becomes too indistinct, the contradictions too apparent, even as I attempt to classify those people in the world whom I know best. Neither would I want others to be predictable enough for me to label. The real joy in human interaction lies in the excitement of the unknown. Overturning expectations can be necessary to preserving the vitality of relationships. If I were never surprised by the behaviors of those around me, my biggest source of entertainment would vanish. For all my love of order when it comes to my room, I don’t want myself, or the people with whom I interact, to fit squarely into any one category. I meticulously follow directions to the millimeter in the chemistry lab but measure ingredients by pinches and dashes in the comfort of my kitchen. I’m a self-proclaimed grammar Nazi, but I’ll admit e. e. cummings’s irreverence does appeal. I’ll chart my television show schedule on Excel, but I would never dream of confronting my chores with as much organization. I even call myself a labeler, but not when it comes to people. As Walt Whitman might put it, “Do I contradict myself? / Very well, then I contradict myself, / (I am large, I contain multitudes.).” I therefore refrain from the temptation to label—despite it being an act that makes me feel so fulfilled when applied to physical objects—when real people are the subjects. The consequences of premature labeling are too great, the risk of inaccuracy too high because, most of the time, not even the hundreds of alphanumeric digits and symbols available for entry on my P-Touch can effectively describe who an individual really is.",1,2.549719743,3.018802025,3.172775743,3.718398001,3.093918554,13.8,18.2,22.8,30.0,20.0
C0,466,"As a high school student, I have always felt that labels were limiting - especially when it came to defining myself. My classmates and teachers have often labeled me as 'quiet' or 'reserved.' While these labels may seem harmless, they have often left me feeling pigeonholed and unable to fully express myself. As I reflect on this experience, I have come to realize that labels are limiting for people - they reduce our complexity and obscure the nuances of who we are. One way in which labels are limiting is by reducing us to a single trait or characteristic. For example, if someone is labeled 'shy,' people may assume that they are also introverted, awkward, and socially anxious. This stereotype may not accurately reflect the person's true personality, but it can influence how people treat them. They may be overlooked in group settings or underestimated in their abilities. In this way, labels can become self-fulfilling prophecies that limit our potential. Another way in which labels are limiting is by ignoring the different facets of our identity. As human beings, we are complex and multifaceted. We have multiple identities - such as race, gender, sexuality, and religion - that intersect and shape our experiences. Labels often ignore this complexity, reducing us to a single aspect of our identity. For example, a woman may be labeled as a 'minority' because of her race, but this label ignores other aspects of her identity - such as her religion, nationality, or sexual orientation - that may also influence her experiences. In this way, labels can obscure the nuances of who we are and lead to inaccurate assumptions about our lives. Moreover, labels can also lead to self-doubt and insecurity. When people label us, we may start to internalize those labels and see ourselves in the same limiting ways. For example, if someone is repeatedly labeled as 'lazy,' they may start to believe that they are incapable of hard work, whether or not that is true. This can be damaging to one's self-esteem and may prevent them from pursuing their goals. It can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading them to become the person that the label implies they are. Yet, while labels can be limiting, there is a way to use them for good - by rejecting them outright. To reject labels is to accept complexity, nuance, and diversity. We are far more than just one characteristic or trait. We have a multiplicity of identities that inform and shape our experiences. By recognizing this complexity, we can reject limiting labels and embody the full extent of our humanity. This is crucial because labels can be especially detrimental for those who do not conform to norms or expectations. We often label things as 'abnormal' or 'weird' because they do not fit into our predetermined categories. This can be harmful to people whose experiences are atypical or marginalized. If someone does not fit into traditional gender categories, for example, labeling them as 'weird' or 'unnatural' is not only hurtful but can also perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination. By rejecting labels, we can begin to appreciate the diversity of human experiences and create a more inclusive and accepting society. To be sure, rejecting labels is easier said than done. It requires a great deal of introspection and vulnerability. We must be willing to confront the different parts of ourselves and embrace them, even if they do not fit into existing categories. This can be challenging, especially when we face pressure from others to conform to norms or expectations. But it is necessary work. To accept our complexity is to affirm our own humanity and resist the limiting labels that others may impose on us. As a young woman, I hope to bring this mindset with me to college and beyond. I reject labels that limit me, and I am committed to embracing the full extent of my complexity. I am not just one thing - I am many things, and I am constantly evolving. By embracing this mindset, I hope to create a more inclusive and accepting society, where people can be themselves without fear of judgment or oppression. In conclusion, labels are limiting for people. They reduce us to a single aspect of our identity, ignore the different facets of our experiences, and perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination. To reject labels is to affirm our own humanity and embrace the full extent of our complexity. It is not an easy task, but it is a necessary one if we hope to create a more inclusive and accepting society. By rejecting labels, we can live fully and authentically, embodying the multiplicity of identities that make us who we are.",0,2.46374992,2.576325522,2.678448991,2.882150795,2.608942859,12.0,16.6,19.0,21.0,17.0
C1,467,"Society is not immune to the labels that it attaches to people. From young children to adults, labels come for everyone, whether self-inflicted or ascribed by others. These labels can come in many forms, encompassing diverse fields of social, cultural, and economic backgrounds. Although labeling may appear to be harmless, it is a complicated process that hinders societal interactions and creates a culture of prejudices, misunderstandings, and stereotypes. Through my personal experiences, I have come to realize that despite the convenience of labeling, it does not fully capture the diverse and unique intricacies of an individual. Instead, we need to look beyond the labels and make an effort to connect with each other as unique and complex human beings. As a student growing up in a multicultural society, I have had firsthand experience with such labeling. Over time, I became the 'smart student' who would excel in academics while others were expected to excel in various aspects of life. Though it was an excellent attribute to have, I sometimes found it challenging to express my authentic self and draw the line between my academic and social life. Over time, growing tired of boundaries and limitations, I learned to embrace my other interests and hobbies, which included becoming a member of a music band, painting on weekends, and even learning a new language. These free-spirited interests helped me create connections and establish friendships beyond academic achievements and told me that labels were indeed limited. Throughout history, labels have been attached to marginalized groups affecting social status, economic opportunities and cultural trends. Stereotypically, there are myriad of labels that society arbitrarily assigns to people. For instance, race, gender and ethnicity as identities can be limiting, often obstructing the multidimensional layers of a person's identity. Even remotely touching on these superficial aspects of someone's identity can prompt prejudiced remarks, portraying 'otherness' as if individuals are different from the rest of the community. This is why it's essential to look beyond the labels and make an effort to understand the complexities of each person's identity. By taking the time to understand other people and appreciate them as the individuals they are, then it becomes clear that limited labelling can't encapsulate the depths of their identity. Each person's past experiences, current beliefs, current circumstances, and their views on life all make up who they are as a person. When we move away from stereotypes and open ourselves up to listen, then it enriches our experiences and the way we interact with others. Developing a deeper understanding of people around us allows for a broader perspective and the value of empathy which in turn makes us better human beings. We must start by analyzing our individual selves, attitudes and conscious efforts to dismiss or avoid generalizing those around us, and then work towards enhancing interpersonal communications to understand their complexities. By connecting with individuals, we develop a deeper and more meaningful relationship with them, even beyond what we think we know. Through such connections, we can share stories, cultural expressions, and value the diversity among us. In conclusion, labeling, while being a part of our mainstream culture, can be limiting and lead to harm, rendering our society unreceptive to various forms of diversity. Through connecting with the world around us, appreciating the complexities of one another's individuality, we can make strides to embrace real diversity. Embracing and understanding our complexities allows us to recognize that we are much more than our labels, and the collective diversity we share is crucial to our personal and collective growth as a society. Breaking away from the stereotypes will begin the transformation of relationships and society, which ultimately brings us closer to a society of individuals who are celebrated for who they are.",0,2.835893231,3.006598174,3.196979999,3.390146618,3.095462254,17.0,22.0,24.6,28.0,23.0
C2,468,"I vividly remember the day when I first stepped into my high school. The bright, white walls and the humming noise of students bustling in the hallways echoed through the building. As I walked down the hallway, I began to notice the diverse students' unique cultures and identities passing by me. There were students from different ethnic backgrounds, religions, and races, each with their unique stories that stood out. Despite being in a diverse environment, stereotypes and judgments made their way into conversations, and I couldn't help but notice the divided society. I decided to take on this issue by creating a community for students to engage with each other and embrace their differences. The community helped students connect and learn about different cultures beyond the surface level. It allowed Alia, a Muslim student, to share the significance of Ramadan and Anabel, a Hispanic student, to highlight the importance of the Day of the Dead. The community brought the students together, and in together, they created a richly diverse and culturally vibrant environment. I realized that we label people from a young age without realizing the negative consequences that come with it. Growing up with a label can create limitations and hinder who we can be. It's essential to realize that people cannot be defined by just a single characteristic, and the uniqueness of each person deserves to be appreciated. The recognition of other people's complexities and uniqueness is something that I learned from my experiences when I befriended a person who turned my world upside down. My friend, Sarah, was autistic, and many people would have labelled her as just that. However, as I spent more time with her, I realized that she was so much more than that. She had a passion for music that was so contagious it was hard not to feel it. She loved to play the piano, sing and even compose some of her own songs. Her perspective on life taught me that even in the most challenging situations, we can still shine bright and persevere through hardship. Her resilience inspired me to create a music club that invited students with disabilities to come together to create and perform music. Through the music club, students were able to express their creativity freely and connect with music on a deeper level. Breaking stereotypes and looking beyond the labels means empathizing with people and seeing them as a whole. It means being open to the perspectives and experiences of others, and acknowledging that every person's identity is complex and dynamic, influenced by various factors that make them unique. Cultural and ethnic labels are often used to categorize individuals based on their physical characteristics, but what we come to forget is that each person is shaped by a unique set of experiences that cannot be generalized. Stereotyping individuals based on race or ethnicity leads to the practice of assuming people are all conforming to a single shared cultural value, which promotes negative cultural assimilation and further enables judgment and social stigma. In conclusion, it's important to remind ourselves that labeling people is limiting to our interactions with them. It creates a culture of prejudices and misunderstandings that ultimately lead to a divided society.

H,469,"When I failed math in my sophomore year of high school, a bitter dispute engulfed my household—'Nicolas Yan vs. Mathematics.' I was the plaintiff, appearing pro se, while my father represented the defendant (inanimate as it was). My brother and sister constituted a rather understaffed jury, and my mother presided over the case as judge. In a frightening departure from racial stereotype, I charged Mathematics with the capital offences of being 'too difficult' and 'irrelevant to my aspirations,' citing my recent shortcomings in the subject as evidence. My father entered a not guilty plea on the defendant’s behalf, for he had always harbored hopes that I would follow in his entrepreneurial footsteps—and who ever heard of a businessman who wasn’t an accomplished mathematician? He argued that because I had fallen sick before my examination and had been unable to sit one of the papers, it would be a travesty of justice to blame my 'Ungraded' mark on his client. The judge nodded sagely. With heartrending pathos, I recalled how I had studied A-Level Mathematics with calculus a year before the rest of my cohort, bravely grappling with such perverse concepts as the poisson distribution to no avail. I decried the subject’s lack of real-life utility and lamented my inability to reconcile further effort with any plausible success; so that to persist with Mathematics would be a Sisyphean endeavor. Since I had no interest in becoming the entrepreneur that my father envisioned, I petitioned the court for academic refuge in the humanities. The members of the jury exchanged sympathetic glances and put their heads together to deliberate. In hushed tones, they weighed the particulars of the case. Then, my sister announced their unanimous decision with magisterial gravity: 'Nicolas shouldn’t have to do math if he doesn’t want to!' I was ecstatic; my father distraught. With a bang of her metaphorical gavel, the judge sentenced the defendant to 'Death by Omission'—and so I chose my subjects for 11th Grade sans Mathematics. To my father’s disappointment, a future in business for me now seemed implausible. Over the next year, however, new evidence that threw the court’s initial verdict into question surfaced. Languishing on death row, Mathematics exercised its right to appeal, and so our quasi-court re- convened in the living room. My father reiterated his client’s innocence, maintaining that Mathematics was neither 'irrelevant' nor 'too difficult.' He proudly recounted how just two months earlier, when my friends had convinced me to join them in creating a business case competition for high school students (clerical note: the loftily-titled New Zealand Secondary Schools Case Competition), I stood in front of the Board of a company and successfully pitched them to sponsor us—was this not evidence that I could succeed in business? I think I saw a tear roll down his cheek as he implored me to give Mathematics another chance. I considered the truth of his words. While writing a real-world business case for NZSSCC, I had been struck by how mathematical processes actually made sense when deployed in a practical context, and how numbers could tell a story just as vividly as words can. By reviewing business models and comparing financial projections to actual returns, one can read a company’s story and identify areas of potential growth; whether the company then took advantage of these opportunities determined its success. It wasn’t that my role in organizing NZSSCC had magically taught me to embrace all things mathematical or commercial—I was still the same person—but I recognized that no intellectual constraints prevented me from succeeding in Mathematics; I needed only the courage to seize an opportunity for personal growth. I stood up and addressed my family: 'I’ll do it.' Then, without waiting for the court’s final verdict, I crossed the room to embrace my father: and the rest, as they (seldom) say, was Mathematics.",1,2.614484422,2.990485332,3.391838975,3.724202977,3.178279297,11.2,17.8,23.4,34.6,19.5
C0,470,"It all started on a cold winter day during my sophomore year of high school. I was sitting in my algebra class, feeling uninterested and distracted. Suddenly, my teacher posed a seemingly simple question: what is the value of x in the equation 2x + 4 = 10? I raised my hand and confidently responded, “x = 3.” However, a classmate, let’s call him Jack, argued that x was actually equal to 2.5, and the class became divided. I found myself intrigued and engaged by this math dispute in a way I had never experienced before. I realized that something as seemingly straightforward as solving for x could inspire passionate debate and differing perspectives, and I began to question what other seemingly mundane subjects could have similar nuances. As I delved deeper into my studies, I discovered that math was not just about finding solutions, but about uncovering the method of finding them. I began to embrace the intellectual challenge of solving complex math problems, and for the first time in my academic career, I felt truly intellectually stimulated. This newfound passion for math led me to pursue higher level courses such as calculus and topology. I found myself constantly seeking out more difficult problems to solve, to the point where my classmates began to joke that I had a “math addiction.” However, my newfound passion was not without its challenges. I encountered many difficult problems that took days to solve, and occasionally I found myself questioning whether my efforts were worth it. However, I always reminded myself of the intellectual curiosity and sense of satisfaction I felt when I finally solved a problem. One particularly challenging problem stands out in my mind. It was a complex algebraic equation with multiple variables, and I remember spending hours on end immersed in it before finally coming up with a solution. The sense of achievement and intellectual satisfaction I felt was indescribable, and it fueled my passion for math even further. As my passion for math grew, I began to contemplate how I could use my skills in the field to make a meaningful impact. I came across an organization called MathWorks, which seeks to enhance math education for low-income students. I was immediately drawn to their mission and was determined to do what I could to help. I contacted the organization and was given the opportunity to volunteer as a math tutor for an after-school program. It was a challenging experience, but being able to help students who were struggling with the same concepts I had once found difficult was incredibly rewarding. Seeing the look of understanding on their faces when they finally grasped a concept was one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. My passion for math has not only sharpened my intellectual abilities, but has also taught me valuable skills such as perseverance, critical thinking, and problem-solving. It has opened up doors for me that I never would have imagined, including the opportunity to present my research on topology at the American Mathematical Society's annual conference. I realize that my passion for math is not something that everyone shares, but I believe that everyone can find something to be passionate about. It may be something as simple as a math dispute in a high school classroom, but finding that spark of curiosity and constantly nurturing it can lead to incredible things. In conclusion, the math dispute in my high school algebra class was the catalyst for my intellectual awakening and passion for math. It taught me that seemingly mundane subjects can have hidden nuances, and that embracing an intellectual challenge can lead to incredible rewards. My passion for math has not only helped me grow intellectually, but has also allowed me to make a meaningful impact on the world around me. I look forward to continuing to pursue my passion and to hopefully inspire others to do the same.",0,2.781319988,2.983260306,3.131474605,3.351711685,3.075846618,17.6,22.0,24.8,26.0,22.0
C1,471,"During my sophomore year of high school, I experienced a transformation that completely changed my academic trajectory. Until that point, my relationship with math had been antagonistic at best - I was convinced that it was too difficult and had no relevance to my life. However, one day in algebra class, a seemingly simple question ignited my curiosity and challenged my preconceptions. From that moment on, I was hooked. Curiosity became passion as I delved deeper into the subject matter, and I discovered the beauty of the methods involved in finding solutions. My studies in mathematics were no longer a chore but an intellectual pursuit that provided me with a sense of satisfaction beyond anything else. Seeking to embrace the challenge, I pushed myself to take courses in calculus and topology and developed a reputation among my peers for having a 'math addiction.' As I continued to explore the subject, I became increasingly keen to use my skills to make a positive difference in the world - something that I had never felt before. I discovered MathWorks, which provides academic support and resources for low-income students, and knew I had to get involved. I began volunteering as a tutor and experienced the joy of seeing the look of understanding on a student's face after successfully grasping a difficult concept. My passion for math has also taught me valuable skills - perseverance, critical thinking, and problem solving - that I can apply in all areas of my life. These skills have proved invaluable and have helped me gain access to opportunities I never thought possible. For example, I was selected to present my research on topology at the American Mathematical Society's annual conference. Through my journey into math, I have discovered that passion can arise from the most unexpected places. A seemingly simple question in an algebra class opened my eyes to the beauty of the subject and inspired my love for math. It was not always an easy road, but my perseverance paid off in a big way.

C2,472,"The harsh, early morning sunlight filters through the rows of towering trees that line my street. The crisp autumn air fills my lungs with each breath, and the crunch of leaves underfoot provides a reassuring rhythm. It's a routine that I've grown accustomed to - walking down this winding street to catch the bus to school. For most of my high school years, this routine was devoid of any excitement or intrigue. However, something changed one day in my sophomore year that would forever alter my academic path. It was a Tuesday, and as I sat in algebra class, I was struggling to keep my eyes open. We were going through yet another iteration of problem sets, and I couldn't help but feel a sense of apathy. However, as my teacher wrote out a seemingly innocuous question on the board, something sparked inside me. The numbers and variables began to interlock in a way that I had never seen before, and as I scrawled out the answer, I could feel the satisfaction of accomplishment growing inside me. That was the spark that ignited a raging fire of mathematical curiosity in me. I became fascinated by the intricate systems that were used to solve some of the most complex problems. The more I learned, the more I realized how little I knew, and that only further fueled my passion. The beauty of mathematics, for me, lies not in the numbers themselves, but in the creativity that is required to solve the puzzles they present. There is a sense of discovery and wonder in every problem, no matter how small, and it is that satisfaction of unlocking a solution that continues to drive my passion forward. In my junior year, my passion for math drove me to take an advanced calculus course. It was a daunting challenge, but it was one that I was eager to take on. I spent countless hours poring over textbook chapters, scrawling out proofs, and solving problems that pushed the limits of my understanding. But perhaps the most rewarding aspect of my newfound passion was discovering the ways in which I could use it to make a difference. I began volunteering with MathWorks, an organization that provides academic support and resources for underprivileged students. As a tutor, I was able to witness firsthand the sense of satisfaction that came with helping others gain knowledge and understanding. It was a truly transformative experience that opened my eyes to the possibilities of using my passion to help others. It was this desire to serve that led me to present my research at the American Mathematical Society's annual conference in my senior year.

H,473,"I learned the definition of cancer at the age of fourteen. I was taking my chapter 7 biology test when I came upon the last question, “What is cancer?”, to which I answered: “The abnormal, unrestricted growth of cells.” After handing in the test, I moved on to chapter 8, oblivious then to how earth-shattering such a disease could be. I learned the meaning of cancer two years later. A girl named Kiersten came into my family by way of my oldest brother who had fallen in love with her. I distinctly recall her hair catching the sea breeze as she walked with us along the Jersey shore, a blonde wave in my surrounding family's sea of brunette. Physically, she may have been different, but she redefined what family meant to me. She attended my concerts, went to my award ceremonies, and helped me study for tests. Whenever I needed support, she was there. Little did I know that our roles would be reversed, forever changing my outlook on life. Kiersten was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma at the age of 22. Tears and hair fell alike after each of her 20 rounds of chemotherapy as we feared the worst. It was an unbearable tragedy watching someone so vivacious skirt the line between life and death. Her cancer was later classified as refractory, or resistant to treatment. Frustration and despair flooded my mind as I heard this news. And so I prayed. In what universe did this dynamic make any sense? I prayed to God and to even her cancer itself to just leave her alone. Eventually, Kiersten was able to leave the hospital to stay for six weeks at my home. My family and I transformed the house into an antimicrobial sanctuary, protecting Kiersten from any outside illness. I watched TV with her, baked cookies for her, and observed her persistence as she regained strength and achieved remission. We beat biology, time, and death, all at the same time, with cookies, TV, and friendship. Yet I was so concerned with helping Kiersten that I had not realized how she helped me during her battle with cancer. I had been so used to solving my problems intellectually that when it came time to emotionally support someone, I was afraid. I could define cancer, but what do I say to someone with it? There were days where I did not think I could be optimistic in the face of such adversity. But the beauty that resulted from sympathizing as opposed to analyzing and putting aside my own worries and troubles for someone else was an enormous epiphany for me. My problems dissipated into thin air the moment I came home and dropped my books and bags to talk with Kiersten. The more I talked, laughed, smiled, and shared memories with her, the more I began to realize all that she taught me. She influenced me in the fact that she demonstrated the power of loyalty, companionship, and optimism in the face of desperate, life-threatening situations. She showed me the importance of loving to live and living to love. Most of all, she gave me the insight necessary to fully help others not just with intellect and preparation, but with solidarity and compassion. In this way, I became able to help myself and others with not only my brain, but with my heart. And that, in the words of Robert Frost, “has made all the difference.”",1,2.435367735,2.689871586,2.950345601,3.252262377,2.741877865,11.8,15.0,18.0,22.0,16.0
C0,474,"I met Sally in first grade, and we instantly became friends. As children, we bonded over toys, games, and sharing snacks. As we grew older, our friendship became deeper, and we shared our secrets, hopes, and dreams. Sally was always there for me when I needed her, and I assumed I was always there for her too. That's why when Sally was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 16, our world shattered. At the time, I felt helpless, and I didn't know what to say or do. I struggled to find words that could comfort her or ease her pain. It was the first time in my life when I faced the harsh reality that life could be so unfair. How could this happen to my friend, who was full of life and had so much to give to the world? Over the next few months, I saw Sally go through chemotherapy, struggle with side effects, and fight for her life. It was a challenging time for her, and it was a challenging time for me as well. But through it all, Sally taught me the true meaning of love. Love is not just a feeling; it's an action. It's something you do for someone else without expecting anything in return. Early on in Sally's illness, I had no idea what love meant. I thought it was enough to tell her I cared about her and that I was sorry. But as time went on, I realized that love was much more than just words. Love is showing up to chemo appointments, making her laugh when she feels like crying, and being there no matter what. I learned that love is putting someone else's needs ahead of your own, and that's what Sally did for me too. Even though Sally was going through the toughest time of her life, she never once complained or asked for help. She didn't want to burden anyone with her problems or make them feel uncomfortable. At first, I didn't understand why she did that. But as I watched her fight through each day, I realized that Sally was showing me what true strength was. She was teaching me how to be resilient, selfless, and courageous. I saw her put on a brave face even when she was feeling her worst, and that inspired me to be a better friend. Sally's cancer taught me the value of time. We all know that time is precious, but it's not until you face a life-threatening illness that you truly understand how important it is. Sally didn't know how much time she had left, and that made us appreciate each moment we had together. We took silly pictures, shared our favorite memories, and made a bucket list of things we wanted to do in the future. Even though we didn't know if that future was possible, we lived in the present and made the most of it. I learned that time is not infinite, and we should cherish the moments we have with those we love. Another thing Sally taught me was the importance of staying positive. She always had a smile on her face, even on the darkest of days. She taught me that it was okay to feel sad or angry, but we should never let those emotions consume us. She showed me that a positive attitude can make all the difference, even in the toughest of times. I realized that when I was with Sally, I felt hopeful and strong. She made me believe that anything was possible, and that we could overcome any obstacle together. Sally's cancer also taught me about gratitude. Until then, I had taken so much for granted: my health, my family, my friends, my education. But after seeing what Sally went through, I was grateful for every little thing in my life. I appreciated every moment spent with loved ones, every sunny day, every good meal, every opportunity I had to learn and grow. I learned that gratitude is not just a feeling; it's an attitude. It's an acknowledgment of all the blessings we have, no matter how small they may seem. In conclusion, Sally's cancer taught me many things, but most importantly, it taught me love. It taught me that love is an action, that time is precious, that staying positive is vital, and that gratitude can change your perspective on life. Sally's experience has made me a better person, and I know that I will carry these lessons with me for the rest of my life. I will always be grateful for the friendship we shared, and I will never forget the love she showed me.

C1,475,"The concept of love is perplexing, to say the least. We use the same word to describe how we feel about ice cream as we do our family, and for years, I thought it was a universal feeling. That was until my grandmother was diagnosed with Alzheimer's, she was no longer the woman I grew up loving. Instead, she became forgetful, distant, and paranoid. Her frailty was unmistakable, and it broke my heart to see her in such a state. For the longest time, I didn't know what to do or how to help her. I felt a sudden surge of rage at her disease, and at myself for not being able to be enough for her. Slowly but surely, I learned that sometimes all love can do is be present. In a world that values productivity over everything else, it can be challenging to accept that sometimes all someone needs is your presence. I didn't know it at the time, but my grandmother's Alzheimer's taught me how to listen to someone with my full attention. She may not have recognized my face or my name, but I could tell she appreciated the company. It was a profound lesson in just being there and listening to another person without judgment. Similarly, my grandmother taught me that it's okay to be vulnerable, that it's okay to ask for help. For the longest time, I felt I had to have all the answers, that if I didn't know how to fix something, it was a sign of weakness. But through her, I learned that there is beauty in vulnerability. I learned how to ask for help, how to let others know when I was struggling. I realized that by being vulnerable, I was not just helping myself, but others as well. My grandmother's Alzheimer's taught me the importance of patience. Sometimes, she would repeat herself or ask the same question multiple times. It used to frustrate me, and I would snap at her. But then I realized it wasn't her fault. She couldn't remember asking the question before. It was a lesson in empathy and understanding. It taught me to be patient with other people's shortcomings, to see beyond the surface level. Her illness also taught me the beauty of reminiscing. Alzheimer's disease may have taken away her memory, but it couldn't take away the memories I had of her. I loved hearing stories of her past, stories of her life before Alzheimer's. We would sit and talk for hours, and I would ask her about different periods, and she would tell me about the things she experienced. It taught me to appreciate the past and reminisce about the good times, even in the face of adversity. In conclusion, my grandmother's Alzheimer's may have taken even the simplest things away from her, but it gave me some of the most valuable lessons in life. Through her, I learned the beauty of being present, vulnerability, patience, understanding, and reminiscing about the past. If there's one thing her disease taught me, it's that sometimes love can't cure everything, but it can make a world of difference by just being there.",0,2.299650545,2.455876669,2.660669436,2.819643851,2.603855947,10.2,15.4,17.6,22.0,16.0
C2,476,"I never could have guessed how much a simple walk on the beach would change my life. The sound of the waves crashing, the salty scent of the ocean, the sand sticking to my toes—all of it soon faded into the background as I laid eyes on Kiersten for the first time. She was my brother’s girlfriend, and I remember being struck by her golden hair, which shimmered like a halo in the sun. In time, Kiersten became more than just my brother’s girlfriend. She became a close friend, someone who was always there to lend an ear or a shoulder to cry on. When I think back on those years, I can still feel the warmth of her embrace and hear the sound of her laughter ringing in my ears. But then, like a bolt of lightning out of nowhere, Kiersten was diagnosed with Stage II Hodgkin's lymphoma. Everything changed. The once-vibrant girl who always had a smile on her face now looked tired and frail. Her hair was gone, replaced by a scarf that she often wore to cover her head. She was tired all the time and seemed to have lost her appetite for life. But even as Kiersten’s body was failing her, her spirit was still strong. She never gave up. Despite the pain and the fear, she remained determined to beat cancer. Watching her battle this disease was one of the most humbling experiences of my life. Even on the darkest of days, Kiersten’s resilience and strength never wavered. As I watched Kiersten go through treatment, I began to understand just how important it is to have people by your side who are willing to fight with you. Every day, I found myself in awe of the love and support that she received from her family and friends. I saw firsthand how powerful it can be to know that you are not alone in your struggles. When Kiersten’s treatment was finally over, and she went into remission, I felt a rush of relief and gratitude. But in some ways, her battle was far from over. The effects of cancer had seeped into every part of her life, and it was clear that she was a changed person because of it. She was more joyful, more grateful, and more determined to seize every moment that life had to offer. In many ways, Kiersten’s brush with cancer changed me, too. It taught me to never take a single moment for granted. It taught me to find beauty in the small things, like the sound of a bird singing outside my window or the warmth of the sun on my face. It taught me to appreciate the people in my life who fill my heart with joy and love. Most of all, Kiersten taught me that resilience is one of the most powerful forces in the world. Even when everything seems to be working against you, there is always a way to fight back. There is always a way to bounce back from even the toughest of challenges. This is something that has stayed with me long after Kiersten’s cancer went into remission. As I think about my own future, I know that there will be struggles ahead. There will be moments of pain and fear, moments when I feel like I am up against an insurmountable wall. But I also know that as long as I remember the lessons that Kiersten taught me, I will never give up hope. In the end, Kiersten’s battle with cancer taught me that life is precious, and that we should cherish every moment that we have. It taught me that even in the toughest of times, we can find joy and hope. And it taught me that no matter what we face, there is always a way to fight back and come out on top.

H,477,"I look over at the digital clock at the front of the bus just as the time changes to 8:30. The engine begins to rumble, the seat begins to shake, and the bus slowly pulls onto Route 6 and heads toward JPA—the Jay Pritzker Academy—near Siem Reap, Cambodia. The bus is alive with chatter. Peace Corps volunteers trade stories about their experiences in their assigned villages; international schoolteachers discuss their plans for the day’s lessons. I overhear one of the Peace Corps volunteers, Deidre, say, “I have to say, the Peace Corps offers incredible health care. They medevaced me to Bangkok when I got dengue fever.” Today, I find myself unable to join the conversation. I stare blankly at the blue cloth seat in front of me, trying to gently coax my knotted stomach out of my throat. All I can think about is the empty seat beside me and the uncomfortable feeling of entering uncertain territory alone. My friend and co-teacher, Shahriyar, is in the Angkor Hospital recovering from a serious bout of amoebic dysentery. I visited him yesterday. He was lying in bed with his summer reading in his right hand and an IV in his left. Looking pale and exhausted, he weakly lifted his head and greeted me. “I don’t know if you know this yet,” he said, “but I’m flying home tomorrow. Are you coming with me?” Though the news didn’t surprise me, the question caught me off guard. As I left the hospital room, I couldn’t help but think how easily this could have been me in his situation. The bus drives over a speed bump faster than it should have, and I’m jolted back to the present. I try to take my mind off Shahriyar and look out the window at the world around me. Everything is so much different than it is in Deerfield, yet it all somehow feels very natural to me. To my left I see an elderly woman wearing a mask sweeping dust off the street; I smile at her, but she doesn’t notice. As the bus gets closer and closer to JPA, the fact that I will have to teach today’s lessons by myself begins to set in. I wonder if I’m physically capable of teaching three hours of class by myself in the ninetydegree heat and 90 percent humidity. In the past, Shahriyar and I had always taken turns leading the class, giving each other a few moments to rest and rehydrate while the other taught. A part of me is afraid to do it. I’ve never had to lead the class without the comfort and support of having Shahriyar by my side. As I think about the challenges I will face, I realize how easy it would be to turn back. I only have to call Sokun—a local tuk-tuk driver and he’d take me to the airport. Knowing my co-teacher has become seriously ill, nobody would think less of me if I went home today. As I sit in my seat, planning my trip home, the bus slows nearly to a stop and then turns onto a narrow red dirt road. I’ve suddenly plunged into a new world. The mess of worn-down concrete buildings and mopeds gives way to miles of flooded rice paddies stretching as far as I can see. Every few hundred yards I see boys and young men working barefoot in the fields. The bamboo huts that dot the landscape make me think back to my visit to the house of one of my students, Dari. I remember looking into his room and seeing a wooden table on his dirt floor. Close by, a bamboo shelf was filled with books. The globe he had won for being on the Honor Roll was proudly displayed on the bookshelf among his prized possessions. Smiling ear to ear, he told us that JPA was the best thing in his life. I realize that it really is too late to go home. I’ve already fallen in love with my students. As the bus pulls into JPA’s driveway, the rest of the teachers begin gathering their materials.

C0,478,"At the age of 17, I found myself stranded in a foreign land. I was volunteering as a teacher in Cambodia, and everything around me seemed strange and unfamiliar. The heat was suffocating, the language was a foreign entanglement, and the only comfort I had was the thought of returning home soon. However, as I progressed through my stay in Cambodia, I realized that I had gained something more significant than just a learning experience - I had overcome my fears. It wasn't always easy in Cambodia. On the first day of my teaching job, I was assigned to teach English to a group of middle school children. I took the first step in front of the class, and all eyes were on me. Their curious stares made me feel naked, and as I opened my mouth to speak, I found myself stuttering incoherently. I could feel the beads of sweat on my forehead, and the relentless thumping of my heart made it hard to concentrate. It was like performing in front of a full stadium, except my audience was a class of thirty students who weren't exactly receptive to my presence. As the days passed, I started to develop a bond with my students. Through smiles and gestures, I was able to communicate with them and make them familiar with me. It was my first realization that communication was not only limited to language but also actions. Furthermore, I gained the confidence to experiment with new teaching methods, making class more interactive and engaging. At one point, I even found myself singing nursery rhymes to a class of rowdy elementary school students! Through these efforts, I finally started to gain traction as a teacher in Cambodia. The students were slowly gravitating towards my methods, and my timid persona was slowly starting to dissipate. Since I was an American student, I also found myself becoming a cultural ambassador for my country, much to my surprise. The fascination and curiosity that the students had for American culture gave me a sense of pride, and I was happy to share my knowledge with them. However, there still existed many fears that crippled me in Cambodia. The most significant being the apparent lack of resources and dire poverty that many Cambodians faced. Seeing children living in unsanitary conditions, without access to basic amenities like education and healthcare, was heart-wrenching. For instance, I once visited a rural school where children were studying on the dirt floor, with barely any level of knowledge about basic hygiene. This experience made me realize how fortunate I was, and how much I took for granted. Over time, I learned to turn this sense of despair into motivation. I started volunteering in local NGOs that worked towards introducing education and healthcare to the marginalized sections of Cambodia. Through my interactions with locals and NGOs, I understood that every little effort counts towards the betterment of society. The significant problems that Cambodia faced would take years to solve but small steps, like donating classroom materials or organizing a hygiene drive, were still significant. My involvement in these organizations made me understand the importance of giving back to society and the immense difference one individual could make. At the end of my volunteer stint in Cambodia, I returned home a changed person. I had developed a newfound appreciation for diverse cultures and the importance of being able to connect with people from different backgrounds. What was once a source of fear and discomfort had now become an avenue for growth and self-discovery. I realized that the world was full of people who were just like me, with dreams, hopes, and aspirations, and that through my experiences in Cambodia, I had developed the ability to communicate with them. In conclusion, my teaching experience in Cambodia taught me that fear was not an obstacle but a stepping stone towards progress. My struggles and fears may have been intense, but they paled in comparison to the persistence and resilience of the Cambodian people. I learned that communication went beyond the barriers of language, and through actions, one could create lasting change. My experiences in Cambodia instilled in me a passion for giving back to society, and as I journeyed forward, I knew that the lessons I had learned in Cambodia would stay with me throughout my life.",0,2.721544153,2.918608495,3.138408565,3.240255856,3.032835185,16.0,17.0,20.6,23.0,18.0
C1,479,"Sitting in the high school classroom, I stared at the clock above the door, feeling lost and anxious. My fingers hovered over the keyboard of my computer, waiting for inspiration to strike. I was working on my admissions essay for Yale and Harvard, and the topic was to write about a time when I overcame fear. My mind wandered back to a time when I was in Cambodia teaching English, and the memory gave me the insight and courage I needed. Teaching English in a foreign country had been a huge leap outside my comfort zone. The students, colleagues, and local culture could hardly have been more different from what I was used to. But I was determined to make my time there worthwhile for my students and myself. As it was my first time teaching English, I had spent countless hours researching, learning and preparing myself. But no amount of research could have prepared me for the day-to-day unpredictability of life abroad. The first few weeks felt like a nightmare. Everything felt new, and I was plagued by anxiety and fear of the unknown. I felt alone, lost, and unsure about how to navigate the unfamiliar customs and routines. But my students quickly warmed up to me, and that helped me feel more at home. Guiding them through the process of learning English was as much about learning and adapting for myself as it was for them. One of the most challenging things was adapting my instruction methods to suit each student's personality, needs, and language proficiency. It was a significant challenge because each student had their own way of learning, and I was continually adapting to meet their needs. However, I discovered that the only way to become better was to keep pushing myself outside of my comfort zone and confronting my fears head-on. Then, one day, my friend and co-teacher, Shahriyar, fell ill and had to be hospitalized. I was alone, at the front of the class without anyone to support me. I was overcome with fear and wondered how I could carry on with the three hours of class all by myself. But then I thought back to a lesson I had taught about idioms when many of my students struggled to understand the meaning of basic words and phrases. I realized that I needed to adjust my lesson plan and start from the basics to help them comfortably talk to me in English. This moment showed me that sometimes, to overcome fear, one needs to adapt and adjust to a new environment. Teaching abroad brought a lot of uncertainty, anxiety, and stress, but it also brought three principles that I now cherish. The first principle is that we must embrace diversity and different cultures to broaden our horizons and gain an understanding of the world around us. Secondly, adapting to change is the only way to grow and develop, both personally and professionally. Lastly, a growth mindset is vital if one wants to tackle any obstacle in life effectively. Teaching in Cambodia taught me the importance of facing my fears head-on, and not letting anxiety and self-doubt rule my life. It also made me realize that stepping out of my comfort zone was one of the best ways to achieve personal growth. I look back at my time teaching abroad with pride and know that those experiences were worth every moment of discomfort and anxiety. As I finish my essay, I glance up at the clock again. I realize that I had written 650 words, and I feel proud. I know that writing about my experience teaching in Cambodia has given me insight and perspective that could set me apart from other applicants. I am confident that I have demonstrated the courage and self-awareness that Yale and Harvard are looking for in their students.",0,2.671326947,2.848981523,2.955496964,3.145111747,2.926694521,15.0,16.4,20.8,23.4,18.5
C2,480,"The sights and sounds of a bustling Cambodian classroom live on in my memory to this day. The sticky heat of the room clung to my skin as I navigated through the noise of students chattering in Khmer. The chalkboard behind me was marked with phrases in both languages, showcasing my attempts to adapt my instruction methods to suit my students' diverse needs. It was in this environment that I learned about the power of adaptability and perseverance. Teaching English in a foreign country pushed me far outside my comfort zone, presenting linguistic, cultural, and logistical challenges. Still, I was inspired by a desire to learn and grow, not just for myself but for my students. In the beginning, I struggled with the unpredictability of daily life; everything from ordering food to navigating new sites on my way to school proved difficult. But in the classroom, my students' enthusiasm and curiosity made me feel more at home. Each day, I walked the dusty streets to school, determined to provide my students with the tools they needed to communicate effectively in English. Adapting to a new and unfamiliar environment was not easy. Every day, I had to challenge myself to think outside the box and approach teaching creatively. Wherever I looked, I saw potential for a new lesson, a new method, a more efficient means of conveying information. As I looked out over my classroom, I knew that my students were counting on me to lead them toward fluency. When my friend and co-teacher Shahriyar fell ill and couldn't come to work, my nerves were tested. How would I manage to teach the next three hours of class on my own, without his support? In that moment, I remembered a lesson I had taught about idioms. I realized that many of my students struggled to understand basic phrases, and that starting at the beginning could help build their confidence in communicating with me in English. This was a significant moment for me—through teaching, I realized that I could adapt to difficult situations and succeed, no matter what obstacles were in my way. It is not just the memories of my time abroad that inspire me today. My experiences in the classroom in Cambodia instilled me with values that I carry with me always: a love of diversity, a willingness to learn, and the importance of accepting challenges and adapting to an ever-changing world. Teaching in Cambodia showcased to me that courage and self-awareness can help us navigate even the most daunting of challenges. While it was not easy to adapt myself to a foreign culture and language, I saw the potential for personal growth in every moment. This experience made me realize that personal growth and learning are never complete—they are ongoing processes that stretch us beyond what we ever thought possible. As I end this essay, I am filled with gratitude for my life experiences that have taught me about perseverance and adaptability. I truly believe that this, combined with my passion for communication and cross-cultural exchange, is what makes me an exceptional candidate for the prestigious universities of Yale and Harvard. In conclusion, my journey to Cambodia taught me about the value of adaptability, perseverance, and personal growth. Through teaching, I learned to embrace the unfamiliar and approach it with empathy and a learning mindset. These experiences prepared me to tackle any obstacle life throws my way and to remain optimistic and hopeful in the face of uncertainty. I am excited about the prospect of attending a prestigious university such as Yale or Harvard and continuing on this journey of learning, growing, and adapting.",0,2.830370933,2.90785068,2.98183458,3.353266291,2.929112399,16.6,19.0,21.8,25.4,20.0
H,481,"I am a conservative. Point-blank. I’m not talking “hardcore, no gay marriage, abortion equates to eternity in Hell, Catholicism is the only religion worthy of my acknowledgment” conservative, but I believe in limited government intervention in private business. I may seem like an unlikely candidate for such beliefs; I live in Springfield, Massachusetts, an urban environment where the majority of the population utilizes some sort of government assistance to supplement the costs of living. Well, maybe not the absolute majority, but I certainly see a lot of it. Though raised as a Catholic, I believe in nothing more than simple spirituality, and do not abide by all the stipulations of the strict Catholic community (although I do continue to attend church because I find the environment welcoming and the people overwhelmingly happy and uplifting). I attend the Drama Studio, a small, conservatory style acting community where I am considered the token Republican (artsy and conservative—is this what Harold Camping meant by the Rapture?) Not surprisingly, my colleagues have made many attempts at conversion (“Watch MSNBC, Danielle; I promise you’ll love it!”) But I stick to my guns— no pun intended. However, I have found that sharing the majority of my time with those of conflicting opinions has enlightened me in the ways of respect and compromise. Enter Jacob Mueller. Literally the son of a preacher man (his father is the minister at Trinity United Methodist Church), his political views on Facebook are listed as “Member of the Communist Party of America.” Oh, boy … He entered my Advanced Scene Work class in its second semester, and as is the Drama Studio custom, I welcomed him with open arms and commenced what I soon discovered to be the long and interesting process of getting to know him. Through this, I discovered a few important things; like me, he loved politics. Like me, he was well informed. And, like me, he was more than willing to argue his opinion. Through our Odd Couple dynamic, we found an endless number of conversation topics. Every day was a new, “Did you see what the Tea Party’s newest legislation entails?” countered by a, “How about that Scott Brown, eh?” I was the Michele Bachmann to his Al Gore. But the remarkable thing about our debates was not their intensity or their depth, but how much I was learning by listening to him talk. A strange thing was happening to me. For the girl who had always been staunchly opinionated and stubborn, who had never been one for agreeing with the opposition, who took pride in her ability to stand her ground even when she represented the minority view, compromise suddenly had a new meaning. Its connotation was no longer negative. And, in turn my ability to not only understand but also respect a view contradictory to my own was growing in strength. In order to foster this newfound mind-set, I presented myself with the ultimate challenge. In a moment of excited passion, I logged on to Amazon.com and, for $4.95, ordered a copy of The Communist Manifesto. The little book, with its floppy laminated cover depicting a hammer and a sickle on a glossy black background and plain white block letters spelling out its title with inconspicuous innocence, took its place at the head of my bed, where it resided for the next month. Bit by bit, it began to fill with marks of pensive notation, speckles of yellow appearing in odd places where the highlighter had bled through, its fragile pages curving with the insistent pen marks that filled their margins. As I devoured the words of Marx and Engels, I realized something remarkable. I’m not going to tell you I agreed with them; in a lot of instances, I didn’t. But I did understand what they were saying, and I was able to respect them both as visionaries and intellectuals. Where the old voice in my head would have said, “Wow, what idiots,” my new voice was open to more than just the fundamental ideas, but the intelligence it must have taken to form them and the thought process behind them. When I register to vote, I will not be registering as a Democrat. You won’t see me at any PETA meetings, and you certainly won’t hear me speaking fondly about President Obama’s plans for health care. But I can proudly say that The Communist Manifesto taught this Republican what it means to compromise, and to respect.",1,2.147134995,2.696153782,3.053797451,3.790277488,2.951267729,12.2,15.2,24.2,35.4,20.5
C0,482,"As a resident of a conservative small town, my political beliefs and values have always been heavily influenced by my surroundings. Growing up, I believed that communism was an evil ideology that threatened our democracy and way of life. I had never given much thought to understanding it until I stumbled upon a book in the library that would change my perspective forever. The book was ‘The Communist Manifesto’ by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. I was initially interested in reading it for the purpose of gaining ammunition against those who believed in it. But as I read through it, I found my preconceived notions and prejudices shattered. Marx's analysis of capitalism and the growing gap between the rich and the poor resonated with me on a personal level. I had witnessed the same phenomena in my own town - a wealthy few living extravagant lives while the rest struggled to make ends meet. This realization was difficult for me to accept. As a conservative, I had been taught to reject communism without giving it a second thought. I realized that I had only been exposed to one side of the argument. It was time for me to step outside my comfort zone and seek out different perspectives. I took the initiative to attend a few meetings of the local socialist group. Initially, I was hesitant and intimidated by their views, but I found myself engaged in a respectful and open-minded discussion. It became clear to me that, although I didn't agree with everything they believed in, they shared similar values of equality and justice that I had always held dear. Through my newfound interest in socialism, I discovered some of the key tenets of communism. The redistribution of wealth and the elimination of economic inequality seemed noble goals. I began to appreciate the idea of shared ownership and communal responsibility, which were central to communist ideology. I saw these values reflected in the social programs and initiatives that I believed in - such as public education and healthcare. However, I knew that communism also had a dark side. The totalitarian regimes that had ruled under the banner of communism had committed countless atrocities against their own people, from mass executions to forced labor camps. I realized that I needed to be careful not to conflate communism and authoritarianism. Despite these limitations, communism taught me to strive for a society in which everyone was valued and had access to opportunities. It highlighted the need to undertake measures to address economic inequality and unjust power structures. These principles motivated me to become involved in local politics, where I started to work with underprivileged communities to empower and uplift them. The lessons I learned from reading ‘The Communist Manifesto’ were not merely academic but had profound implications for my outlook on life. I became attuned to the issues of socioeconomic inequality and the power imbalances that perpetuate it. I started volunteering for progressive causes and speaking out against injustice. It wasn’t easy to break away from the conservative norm in my town. I faced criticism and disapproval from friends and family members who considered my political leanings to be misguided. But I refused to compromise my values or my newfound respect for communism. I recognized the importance of remaining open to different perspectives and learning from them. Through my journey, I learned that being conservative didn’t mean rejecting new ideas and perspectives. True conservatism involves a respect for tradition, but also an openness to new ways of thinking within that tradition. I became more tolerant and accepting of diverse viewpoints, even when they didn’t align with my own. Ultimately, my experiences taught me that to make progress, we must overcome our biases and engage with perspectives that challenge our assumptions. It's only when we're open-minded and willing to learn that we can truly achieve a better world. In conclusion, reading ‘The Communist Manifesto’ was a turning point in my life, it taught me that we should be critical and conscious of our preconceived notions and biases. It opened my mind to new ideas and it challenged me to examine my own deeply held beliefs. I found common ground with people of different political ideologies, and I discovered the importance of respectful dialogue and debate. By learning to respect communism, I learned to respect the power of differing perspectives and the value of stepping outside of my comfort zone.",0,2.741336648,2.833371972,2.979809491,3.099971564,2.945636717,14.0,16.0,19.0,22.0,18.0
C1,483,"As a conservative growing up in a divided political climate, the value of compromise was not always apparent to me.

Today, as I apply to top-level universities such as Yale and Harvard, I am confident that my ability to work collaboratively towards solutions and engage in productive dialogue will set me apart as a candidate. My journey towards valuing compromise began in my sophomore year of high school in my mock election simulation. As a representative of the conservative party, I was eager to promote my beliefs and prove that my side was the right one. However, as the simulation progressed, I found myself struggling to make progress. It was only when I began to consider the other side's proposals and seek to understand their perspective that I began to find common ground. Through this experience, I realized that compromise was not a sign of weakness but an active engagement with the issues at hand. I carried this lesson with me into my personal relationships and extracurricular activities, such as debate team. Finding ways to work collaboratively with others towards a shared vision became increasingly important to me, and I began to see the value in nuance and complexity. This was not always easy, and I continued to struggle with finding ways to reconcile my beliefs with those of others. However, through each experience, I was able to develop my skills of compromise and collaboration. Today, as I look towards my future, I am excited to continue to build upon these skills.

C2,484,"As a conservative growing up in a divided political climate, I learned that the value of compromise cannot always be found within the easy or the comfortable. It was a lesson I hadn't fully learned until I embarked on an adventure that would change the course of my life. It was the summer after my sophomore year, and I was participating in a leadership program in Washington D.C. This was my dream come true, surrounded by like-minded individuals and submerging myself in my passion for politics. But as the program went on, I became increasingly unsettled. The group was structured to encourage attendees to explore their ideas and thoughts during roundtable discussions. But what began as a promising exercise, became a never-ending political debate that led to fiery arguments between the liberal and the conservative sides. I felt like I was constantly under attack, and I knew that leading with more aggression will only result in futility. I couldn't help but feel like the group was falling apart as the members reached an impasse with their discussions. But that's when I made a bold decision that still surprises me to this day. I reached out to one of the most vocal and opposing members of the group, and together we made a blind phone appointment to talk outside of the group. Taking that leap of faith was the turning point that showed me the merits of compromise. During our call, something amazing happened - we discovered that we had more in common than our political ideologies. We were both invested in our futures, and we both shared a passion for politics. We actually listened as we shared our personal stories, and began to appreciate the nuances each side brought to the table. As we continued to talk, we began to recognize the merit of addressing the findings in the group together. Finally, we were able to guide the group back to the lessons we could extract from the discussion. I am still astounded by the experience - how a conversation of such vulnerability could change how I approach every challenge in my life. It taught me that compromise is not just about reaching a common ground, but also about opening our minds to new ideas and broadening our perspectives, paving the way for constructive dialogue. Since that fateful phone call, I have taken several steps to continue to hone my ability to find common ground. As a member of the debate team, I have worked collaboratively with people who hold different opinions than mine to create cases that would be worth a second glance. I have also volunteered for political candidates who do not necessarily align with my beliefs. Instead of engaging in hostile exchanges, I took the opportunity to learn how they plan to tackle issues that we both care about. In all these instances, I have tried to lead with empathy and understanding, aware that I am only as good as my willingness to engage productively. Today, as I apply to top-tier universities, such as Yale and Harvard, I know that the skills I have acquired will make me a valuable part of their community. I now see compromise as a seed for growth and an opportunity for individuals to learn and grow from each other. Through every experience, whether valuable, thrilling, or even uncomfortable, I have come to treasure the power of compromise for its ability to forge bridges between ideas and people, and to create the common ground that brings success. In conclusion, the value of compromise is undeniable, and its merits extend far beyond the world of politics or social interactions. It goes beyond reaching a common ground, and instead is about engaging productively, and actively seeking out different viewpoints with an open mind. I have learned that productive dialogue is the foundation of progress, and that compromise is the seeds of solutions.

H,485,"I sat under the table, burying my head tightly in my folded arms, while the other children sat on the carpet, listening to the teacher’s story. The language barrier was like a tsunami, gurgling with strange and indistinguishable vocalizations. Elementary school wasn’t as fun as I expected at all. “Hello?” Hearing a whisper, I raised my head up, only to notice a boy’s face merely inches away. I bolted up in surprise, my head colliding gracefully with the underside of the table. Yelping in pain, I noticed that the entire class was staring at me. That was the story of how I met my first friend in Canada. That boy, Jack, came to visit me during my lonely recesses. It was rather awkward at first—I could only stare at him as he rambled on in English. But it was comforting to have some company. From there, our friendship blossomed. Our initial conversations must have been hilarious to the hapless bystander. Jack would speak in fluent English while I spurted sentence after sentence of Mandarin. It was like watching tennis—rallies of English and Mandarin back and forth. But I learned quickly, and in no time I was fluent. Jack also showed me the ropes of Western culture. Heaven knows how embarrassing my birthday party would’ve been if he hadn’t told me about those so-called “loot-bags” beforehand. Today, I volunteer at a community service agency for new immigrants where I work with children. I do it because I understand the confusion and frustration of dealing with a strange and sometimes hostile environment; I remember how it feels to be tangled up in an amalgam of unfamiliar words and sounds. And so I teach them; I give seminars on reading, writing, and speaking skills as well as Western culture, history, and sometimes, a bit of social studies. But I strive to do more than just that. I try to be a friend—because I remember how Jack helped me. I organize field trips to the science center, the museum, and the symphony: double-whammy trips where children can have fun while improving their literacy skills. Through these experiences, I try to understand each of them as unique individuals—their likes, dislikes, pet peeves, background. Everyone needs a guiding light through the lonesome process of adaptation, a friendly bump to lift them from the dark shroud of isolation. That’s what Jack did for me—with a rather painful bump to the head—and it’s also what I do for these immigrant children. My hope is that, one day, these children will also feel compelled to do the same, helping others adapt to an unfamiliar environment.

C0,486,"Growing up in a small suburban town in upstate New York, I never could have predicted the outcomes of the friendships I was about to make. I was always a social person, who loved meeting new people and fostering new connections. But when my family moved to New York City for my father’s job opportunity, everything changed. Suddenly, I was thrust into a new world, filled with new customs, new people, and a whirlwind of culture shock. At first, I was intimidated by the towering skyscrapers, the bustling streets, and the thick accents of the people around me. How could I connect with people who were so different from me? My first day of school was particularly daunting. I walked into my classroom and saw students from all backgrounds: African American, Hispanic, Asian, and European. I felt like an outsider in a sea of diversity. But it didn't take long for me to adjust. Soon, I found myself drawn to a group of students who shared my passion for music. Despite the language barriers, cultural differences, and social hierarchies, my love for music was enough to transcend all boundaries. As I spent more time with my new friends, I was amazed by how much I learned about their cultures, and how much they were willing to learn about mine. One particular friend stood out to me. Her name was Linh, and she was a Vietnamese immigrant who had been in the United States for only two years. Despite coming from an entirely different world, we bonded over our shared love for classical music. We would spend hours after school practicing together, and I noticed that even though our upbringings were drastically different, we still had a lot in common. At first, I was fascinated by Linh's stories about her life in Vietnam. Her parents were farmers, and her childhood was spent playing in rice paddies with her siblings. Hearing about her experiences gave me a glimpse into a world I never would have seen otherwise. While we were very different people culturally, we realized that we had many similarities in terms of our values, such as the importance of family and hard work. As I spent more time with Linh, I found myself asking more and more questions about her culture. What did she think about American culture? How did her family celebrate holidays? Was there anything about American life that she found strange or difficult to adapt to? These conversations were eye-opening for me, as I started to see the world from a different perspective. I began to appreciate the little things about my culture that I had taken for granted, such as the ease with which I could communicate with others, and the abundance of resources and opportunities available to me. As I look back on my journey from small-town suburbia to the bright lights of New York City, I realize that my friendships along the way were what made the experience meaningful. Through my interactions with people of different cultures, I became a more empathetic and globally aware person. I learned that there is so much to be gained from stepping outside of one's comfort zone and embracing diversity. Now, as I prepare to apply to college, I can see just how much my friendships have shaped my perspective. As an international relations major, I hope to continue to explore the ways in which cultures interact and adapt to each other. I believe that through open dialogue and mutual understanding, we can make the world a more connected and peaceful place. In conclusion, my friendships during my time in New York City taught me the importance of cultural adaptation and embracing diversity. By finding common ground with people who were very different from me, I was able to expand my worldview and appreciate the different customs and traditions that make our world so rich.

But instead of burying my head underneath a table like the narrator did, I decided to embrace the culture shock and see where it would take me. One of the biggest challenges I faced was adapting to the German way of life. I had to learn to embrace the food, customs, and traditions that were different from what I was used to in America. At first, it was difficult to adjust to the lack of ice in my drinks or the bread that seemed to accompany every meal. However, over time, I came to appreciate the unique flavors and dishes of the German cuisine. Another hurdle was adapting to the German work ethic. In America, perhaps due to our more laid-back culture, work is sometimes viewed as a necessary evil one must complete in order to enjoy the rest of their life. Germany, on the other hand, has a culture that values work and takes pride in it. At first, I was intimidated by their rigorous approach to work, worried that I would not be able to meet their strict expectations. But as I got more used to the German work environment, I felt a sense of pride in the high standard that I was held to. One of the most significant challenges of adapting to a new culture is adapting to the language. The narrator in the original essay experienced struggles in making themselves understood, as they found themselves speaking a language different from what the other children were speaking. I, too, felt this same sense of struggle when I first arrived in Germany. As a native English speaker, I was so used to communicating with ease that I was shocked to find myself stumbling over basic phrases and struggling to understand simple conversations. However, instead of being discouraged by my language struggles, I embraced the challenge of learning a new language. The more German I spoke, the easier it became, and the more I found myself able to connect with the people around me. As I lived in Germany, I began to realize that adapting to a new culture is not just about learning to exist within a new system, but about learning to love that system. It is easy to take the culture and customs of one's home country for granted, especially when one has never had to see themselves from an outsider's perspective. However, by immersing oneself in a new culture, it is possible to gain a better understanding of one's place in the world, and to appreciate the uniqueness and beauty of a different way of living. Adapting to a new culture is something that has changed me fundamentally as a person. My time in Germany showed me the power that comes from stepping out of one's comfort zone and embracing the new and unexpected. It taught me to see the world in a different way, to appreciate the beauty and intricacy of different cultures, and to push myself to grow in unexpected ways. Just as the narrator of the original essay went on to share their experiences with others by volunteering at an immigrant center, I too now feel the need to share my knowledge with others. Whether by speaking the German language with a fellow traveler, sharing stories and experiences with friends, or using my experience to help others adapt to a new culture, I am proud of what I have learned and the person whom it has made me. Adapting to a new culture is not an easy process, nor is it one that should be taken lightly. However, when approached with an open heart and a curious mindset, it is an experience that can change one's life in the most profound way possible. I leave Germany a different person than when I arrived, and I will never forget the richness and beauty of the German culture that helped to shape me into the person that I am today.",0,2.78630195,2.947095161,3.161233607,3.324572954,3.036935599,17.0,22.0,26.0,30.0,23.0
C2,488,"As the plane descended into the city of Munich, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nervousness wash over me. My senses were immediately bombarded by the foreign sights and sounds of a new culture. The sharp scent of pine drifted through the air as we landed, a smell that I would soon come to associate with Germany. The first few weeks in Germany were a blur of new experiences and challenges. The cuisine, the work ethic, and the customs were all vastly different from what I was used to in America. But instead of shrinking away from the unfamiliarity, I decided to fully embrace it. One of the most significant challenges I faced was adapting to the German work culture. The Germans have a reputation for being highly productive and efficient, with a strong emphasis on accomplishing tasks with determination and attention to detail. As someone who was used to a more relaxed and laid-back work environment in America, I found myself initially overwhelmed by the expectations. Every day felt like a test, as I learned to navigate new customs and expectations. But as time went on, I found that I was able to adapt and thrive in this environment. I took pride in being able to deliver the efficiency and high standard of work that was expected of me. Adapting to a new language was another significant challenge. German is a notoriously difficult language to learn, and I struggled with the nuances of grammar and vocabulary. But as I began to speak with locals and listen to their stories and experiences, I found that my language skills rapidly improved. It was as if the words and sentences began to take on a life of their own, becoming something more than just a means of communication. One of the most rewarding aspects of living in Germany was the food. Although I initially struggled to adapt to the bread-heavy cuisine, I soon came to appreciate the rich flavors and varied textures of German meals. The crisp texture of a Wiener schnitzel, the aroma of freshly baked bread at the local bakery, and the sweet, fruity flavor of German wine – all of these sensations became emblematic of my time in Germany. As I spent more time in Germany, I began to see the beauty and richness of the culture more clearly. There was a sense of order and purpose to German life that I found refreshing and inspiring. The landscape was dotted with reminders of the country's past, from the towering spires of Gothic cathedrals to the somber memorials to World War II. And yet, there was also a sense of forward momentum, a sense that the people were constantly moving forward in pursuit of growth and progress. In many ways, my time in Germany was a challenge, but it was also one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. It taught me the importance of being open to new experiences and of embracing the unfamiliar, as well as the power of resilience and determination in the face of daunting challenges. Along the way, I discovered a new sense of purpose, a deeper appreciation for the beauty and richness of different cultures, and a renewed sense of curiosity and wonder at the world around me. In conclusion, adapting to a new culture can be challenging, but it is ultimately a rewarding and transformative experience. By immersing oneself in a new environment, one can learn to appreciate the nuances and richness of a different way of living, and to develop new skills and perspectives that can help one thrive in unfamiliar surroundings. As I continue on my journey through life, I am grateful for the lessons and experiences that I gained in Germany, and for the way that they have helped to shape me into the person that I am today.",0,2.751872821,2.899630679,3.123613418,3.3555591,2.973967815,15.0,20.0,23.0,25.4,21.0
H,489,"I wrap my scarf more firmly around my neck, feeling the chill of the brisk January air as I trudge my way to practice. The bus stop isn’t actually that far from the pool, but with a heavy backpack and the fancy shoes that my host sister insisted I wear, the three-minute trek seems to last forever. Turning the corner three blocks down, I finally make it to the parking lot and see one of my friends. “Salut, Thomas.” He knows that it’s me without even looking. “Salut, Danielle.” He finishes fiddling with his bicycle lock and stands to greet me. I lean in for my customary kiss, and he obliges, bisous-ing me once on each cheek, before we walk toward Piscine Bréquigny together. Easy conversation flows between us as our well-trained feet follow the paths to our respective changing rooms. I punch in the code on the girls’ side and open the door. Familiar figures stand in various states of undress, and bisous go all around while we change and speculate on the various tortures Marc will put us through today. Then we head down to the pool deck, ready to meet our fates. I get to our coach first, and mentally switch back into English. “Hey, Marc, what’s up?” He shrugs. “Fine.” I laugh and give him a high five, then move on to bisous and ça va? the rest of the boys. When I get to Islem, who is Algerian, the two of us proceed to execute our exceedingly complex non-French secret handshake, recently perfected at Tours during last week’s three-day meet. (We foreigners have to stick together, after all.) We end with a perfect fist bump, and I smirk. Islem winks back at me. “Et ouais.” That’s how we roll. Marc eventually yells at us to get to work, and we all start to put on our caps and goggles. I pull out my team cap from home, reflecting on how much I’ve changed since I left. Four months ago, I was mute, standing awkwardly to the side, hoping that English instructions for the new and frightening social interaction would suddenly appear out of thin air. Now, flawless French rolls off my lips as I greet my friends, laughing freely at inside jokes, not thinking twice about kissing swimsuit-clad swimmers on the cheek. I’m not just on the team anymore—I’m part of it, and every single bisous reminds of that fact. Someone pushes me into the pool and my shriek is swallowed by the water. I surface and swear my revenge, glaring all the while at Pierre, the obvious culprit, who is grinning unabashedly. Then he yelps and falls as he himself is pushed in as well. The whole team eventually follows us into the water to start the day’s warm up, and a small smile, fond and content, flits across my face before I join them.",1,2.272510044,2.685821326,2.90372396,3.268714568,2.820835399,10.0,13.8,18.2,25.8,17.0
C0,490,"When I was in middle school, I was on the track team. I had always enjoyed running, and the excitement of competition made it even more thrilling. But my experience on the track team was not what I had hoped it would be. Despite being part of a team, I often felt isolated and unsupported. It wasn't until I joined the robotics team in high school that I truly understood what it meant to be part of a team. Robotics was a completely new experience for me. I didn't know anything about building robots, coding, or designing mechanisms. But I was excited to learn and be a part of something bigger than myself. From the first day of practice, I was struck by the sense of camaraderie among the team members. Everyone was working together, sharing ideas and helping one another. No one person was in charge; we all had a voice and were encouraged to contribute to the team's success. I found myself becoming more and more invested in the team's goals, and wanting to do everything I could to help us succeed. As we worked on our robot over the course of several months, I realized that being part of a team meant something more than just working together towards a common goal. It meant building relationships, supporting one another, and celebrating each other's successes. I saw this in action when we won our first competition. The joy and excitement we all felt was contagious, and it was truly a team effort that had gotten us there. Being part of a team also taught me the importance of communication. It was essential that we all understood what we were working on, what the goals were, and how we could best support each other. This required open and honest communication among team members. We had to be willing to listen to one another and be willing to compromise when necessary. But the most important thing that being part of a team taught me was the value of perseverance. Building a robot from scratch is no easy feat, and we faced many challenges along the way. There were times when we felt like giving up, when the task ahead of us seemed impossible. But we never gave up. We kept pushing forward, working together to overcome each obstacle that came our way. And in the end, it was all worth it. As I reflect on my experience on the robotics team, I realize that being part of a team has changed me in many ways. I am more confident and self-assured. I am more willing to take risks and try new things. And perhaps most importantly, I am more willing to work together with others towards a common goal. I have come to understand that being part of a team is not just about achieving success. It's about building relationships and learning from one another. It's about pushing ourselves to be our best, but also supporting one another when we fail. And it's about never giving up, even when the task at hand seems impossible. As I move forward into college and beyond, I know that the lessons I learned on the robotics team will stay with me. I will seek out opportunities to be part of a team, whether it's in my coursework, extracurricular activities, or future job opportunities. I know that I will be a better student, a better teammate, and a better person for having had this experience. In conclusion, becoming part of a team is about more than just working together towards a common goal. It's about building relationships, communicating effectively, and never giving up when faced with obstacles. My experience on the robotics team taught me these valuable lessons, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such a supportive, dedicated group of individuals. I look forward to continuing to build relationships and work towards common goals in college and beyond, and I know that the skills I learned on the robotics team will stay with me for years to come.",0,2.387465308,2.491183693,2.605259678,2.81951935,2.54776326,11.0,14.0,17.0,22.0,16.0
C1,491,"Throughout my high school experience, I have learned the importance of becoming part of a team. As a track and field athlete, I had originally thought that being part of a team was simply about competing together. However, when I joined the robotics team, I quickly learned that being part of a team is far more than just working together towards a common goal.

C2,492,"The sound of the machine whirring as we worked tirelessly to construct our robot echoed through the robotics lab. The smell of burnt solder and hot metal filled the air, a sharp contrast to the fresh scent of the grass on the track field. These two sensory experiences could not be more different, yet they both taught me valuable lessons about being part of a team. One of my most vivid memories from my track and field experience was during the final stretch of a grueling 3200-meter race. My mind and body were exhausted, but I refused to give up. My teammates and I had been training for months for this exact moment, and I couldn't let them down. As I approached the finish line, I could hear the cheers of my teammates and feel the sweat on my face. I pushed myself harder than I ever had before and collapsed to the ground, overwhelmed with a sense of satisfaction and pride. This experience taught me the value of perseverance and determination in the face of seemingly impossible odds. Alone, I could not have pushed myself to finish the race. It was only through the support and encouragement of my teammates that I was able to achieve my goals. Similarly, my time on the robotics team taught me the importance of collaboration and teamwork. Our team had a diverse set of skills and experiences, and it was only by leveraging each other's strengths that we were able to design and construct a fully functioning robot. We spent countless hours working together in the lab, bouncing ideas off of each other and tackling challenges as they arose. One particularly challenging moment came when we realized that a key component of our design was not working as intended. The team was frustrated and unsure about how to proceed, but we didn't give up. We came together, brainstormed solutions, and ultimately worked through the problem. That experience cemented in my mind the idea that being part of a team means being able to rely on one another in difficult times. As I prepare to move on from high school and attend college, I know that my experiences as part of a team will serve me well. I am excited to continue to build relationships and work with others towards common goals. I hope to use the skills and lessons I have learned to make a positive impact on the campus community and beyond. In conclusion, being part of a team is about more than just working together towards a goal. It's about persevering in the face of challenges, leveraging the strengths of each team member, and supporting one another through the ups and downs of the journey.

H,493,"“Let’s face it, you’re slow,” my violin teacher said. He was, as always, complaining that running was detracting from my practice time. That summed up what running had always meant to me, ever since I was a seventh grader, choosing his sport for the first time. I was fine and content, however. I always had Jeffrey and Archie, classmates like me who ran slowly. We were good friends. We laughed together; we raced together; we pushed each other, and endured tough workouts together. But after middle school the people I trained with went on to do things they were better at. I remained, even though I was not good enough to be considered for varsity. High school running was hell. I struggled with workouts, most of which I had to run alone. In the hot, dry days of autumn, I often coughed on the dust trails left by my teammates as they vanished into the distance. During the workouts, I got passed incessantly, almost getting run over on occasion. It hurt not to be important; to be dead weight for the team. I looked forward to the next year, when I could hopefully run with the incoming freshmen. It didn’t happen that way. Even a year later, I was still the slowest on the team. How could the freshmen who had snored off the whole summer beat me, a veteran from middle school and high school with decent summer training? I nevertheless reconsidered the effectiveness of my training, and looked forward to getting “back in shape.” It was only after my condition had been deteriorating steadily for a few weeks that I began to feel a new level of humiliation. I started to have trouble keeping up with old ladies in the park, and each day I worked frantically to prevent the discovery of that fact by my teammates, running toward the sketchy areas of the ramble, in the south, where there’s barely anybody. My mother, worried about the steady deterioration of my condition, contacted a doctor. I was anemic. The doctor prescribed a daily iron pill, and the results were exhilarating. I joked that I was taking steroids. I sunk into endless oxygen. I got tired less. During the workouts, I felt more machine than man. Iron therapy taught me something fundamental. It reminded me why I was running; why I had stuck to this damn sport for four straight years. When I was anemic, I struggled to gather what little motivation I had for those painfully slow jogs in those parks. Putting the effort in, and seeing the dramatic results fooled my mind like a well-administered placebo. Iron therapy was the training wheels that would jump-start my dramatic improvement. It took four months—four months of iron pills, blood tests, and training—to get back to my personal best: the 5:46 mile that I had run the year before. Early February that year, the training wheels came off. I was running close to seven miles a day on my own. But I wasn’t counting. I could catch a light. I could walk as many stairs as I wanted without getting tired. I was even far ahead of where I was the year before. After two and a half years as a 5:50 miler, I finally had a breakthrough race. I ran a 5:30. I asked coach if I could eventually break 5 minutes. He told me to focus more on maintaining my fitness through spring break. I ran the mile again, this time outdoors. Coach had me seeded at a 5:30. I ran the first lap, holding back. I didn’t want to overextend myself. I hoped to squeeze by with a 5:35. The euphoria was unprecedented as I realized by the second lap that I was a dozen seconds ahead and still holding back. I finished with a 5:14. On the bus ride back from the meet, one of my long-standing dreams came true. I pretended to ignore Coach sitting next to me, but he kept on giving me glances. He was excited about my time. We talked a lot about the race. We talked about my continuous and dramatic improvement. He said it was early in the season and that I would break 5 minutes after only a few weeks of training. Six weeks later, Mr. Song, my chemistry teacher, asked me if I had broken 5 minutes for the mile yet. I told him all about how I had run in three meets over the past month and had failed to break 5:15 on every one of them. I told him that 5 minutes was now for me a mirage in the distance. Mr. Song, however, did not show much concern: “You’re just overtrained. Once you ease up before the big meet, you’ll drop in time once more.” Even though these consoling words were from the man who had baffled my nutritionist when he had guessed that I was anemic, I still doubted his wisdom. On Sunday, I would run the mile once. My last mile of the year. This was it. Using my tried-and-true racing strategy, I finished with a 5:02, a 12- second drop in time. Mr. Song’s predictions had again turned out to be correct. Before I was anemic, the correlation between hard work and success was something that only appeared in the cliché success stories of the talented few. Now, I am running more mileage than I ever have before. And my violin teacher still complains. But I smile. I know it’s going somewhere.",1,2.030553307,2.411616818,2.606403093,2.980991896,2.534470268,6.0,9.0,13.0,18.0,12.0
C0,494,"As a young girl growing up in a small town in rural America, I always found myself searching for an outlet to escape the struggles of everyday life. My parents were both hardworking, but they never had enough money to afford additional extras, so I found myself turning to running in order to overcome the obstacles and hardships that came my way. For years, running had been my escape, my sanctuary. I would lace up my sneakers and run for miles, my feet pounding the pavement as I lost myself in the rhythm of my breath. I used to think that running was just a way to stay in shape or to clear my head, but the longer I ran, the more I discovered that I was also overcoming the hardships of life. My freshman year of high school was a difficult time for me. I had just moved to a brand new town and didn't know anyone. I struggled to make friends and to fit in socially. I found myself staying up late talking to my parents, who happened to live across the country. My mom would always tell me to go for a run if I ever felt stressed or anxious. So one day, I put on my sneakers and ran. I ran for miles, pushing myself harder than I ever had before, and when I got home, I felt empowered. Running gave me a new sense of confidence and strength. After that day, it became my go-to solution for anything that was causing me stress. Running became even more important to me when my family faced financial struggles. My parents lost their jobs and we struggled to make ends meet. For a while, things were really tough. But even when times were at their darkest, I could always count on running to pull me through. When I was feeling down, I would hit the pavement and run for miles. The endorphins that surged through my body made me feel like I had the strength to overcome anything. To many people, running is just a sport or a way to stay in shape. But for me, it was so much more. Running became a metaphor for life. When I was faced with an obstacle, something that seemed impossible to overcome, I knew that I could push through it, just like I did on the track. I could set a goal for myself, break it down into smaller, more manageable steps, and then work tirelessly to reach it. Running taught me to never give up and to always strive for better. It gave me a sense of perseverance that I apply to everything I do. My love of running has led me to become involved in cross country and track in high school. I have been fortunate enough to have a supportive coach who has pushed me to reach new heights. When I am running, I feel like I am in a world of my own, where nothing else matters except the sound of my feet hitting the pavement. The rhythmic sound and my steady breathing make me feel alive, and I crave the challenge of going farther and faster with each run. More than anything, running has taught me that obstacles are inevitable in life. But how we face those obstacles is what matters most. We can approach them with a sense of defeat, or we can rise to the challenge and push forward. Through running, I have learned that I am capable of overcoming anything. Whether it's a tough race or a personal struggle, I know that I can dig deep, find my inner strength, and come out on the other side stronger than before. Running has given me a passion for life that I carry with me in everything that I do. It has taught me that anything is possible if I put my mind to it, and that I am capable of achieving great things. As I look to the future, I know that I will face more obstacles, more challenges, and more hardships. But I also know that I will be prepared, with the lessons that running has taught me guiding me on my journey. The biggest obstacle I have faced and overcome through running is my own self-doubt. I used to doubt my abilities and my worth, but running has shown me the power of believing in myself. When I am running, I feel like I can conquer the world, and that feeling has carried over into my everyday life. I am more confident in myself, and I trust the decisions I make. Running has taught me that life is a journey, and that there is joy to be found in every step. Whether I am running on a fresh, dewy morning or pushing through a difficult race, I am reminded of the beauty of life and the power of overcoming obstacles. Running has made me stronger, both mentally and physically, and it has given me a passion for pushing myself to new heights.

C1,495,"Running was always something that I loved, but it didn't love me back. I started running in middle school, and by the time I entered high school, I was convinced that I was never going to be good enough to make the varsity team. Despite my struggles, I pushed forward with my passion for running, determined to become a better athlete, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't seem to keep up with the other runners on the team. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with anemia that I realized that it wasn't my lack of effort that was holding me back - it was a medical condition that I had no control over at the time. And so, I set out on a journey to improve my health, to become the best athlete I can be, and to prove to myself that my struggles with iron deficiency would not define me. My diagnosis of anemia was a turning point for me, a moment of clarity that helped me recognize the importance of taking care of my body. I started taking iron supplements, and my mother made sure that I incorporated iron-rich foods into my diet. At first, it was tough. I felt like I was forcing myself to eat things that I didn't like, and certain foods would upset my stomach. But over time, I started to feel better, both physically and mentally. Running became less of a struggle and more of a joy. I started to see progress in my times, and I was able to keep up with my teammates for the first time. It was an incredible feeling, one that I will never forget. But more than that, my journey with anemia taught me some of the most valuable lessons I have ever learned. First and foremost, it taught me the importance of perseverance. There were days when I felt like giving up, when the supplements seemed to be doing nothing, and when I felt like I was never going to be fast enough. But I kept going. I kept running, kept eating the right foods, and kept taking the supplements, even when it seemed like there was no progress being made. And then one day, I broke my personal best time. It was a moment that I will never forget, and it would not have been possible without perseverance. Secondly, my experience with anemia showed me the power of community. When I first started running, I felt like I was alone, like nobody else struggled the way that I did. But then I found a community of runners who supported me, encouraged me, and pushed me to be my best. They were there for me when my times were slow, and they were there for me when I broke my personal best. And I was there for them, too. Together, we made each other better, and that sense of community was invaluable. Finally, my experience with anemia taught me the importance of self-care. I learned that I needed to take care of my body if I wanted it to perform at its best. This lesson goes beyond running, too. It applies to all aspects of life, from schoolwork to social interactions. Taking care of myself has become a top priority, and my experience with anemia showed me how important that is. As I think about my future, I know that those three lessons - perseverance, community, and self-care - will continue to guide me forward. I hope to continue running in college, and I am excited to see where my passion takes me. Wherever I end up, I know that the journey will not always be easy, but I am confident that I have the tools I need to thrive. Looking back on my journey with anemia and running, I feel grateful. I am grateful for the diagnosis that helped me understand my body better. I am grateful for the challenges that pushed me to become a better athlete and person. And I am grateful for the lessons that will stay with me for the rest of my life. As I apply to Yale or Harvard, I hope that those experiences will help me stand out as an applicant, as someone who has overcome obstacles and emerged stronger because of it.",0,2.263224121,2.577685535,2.738402559,2.943432723,2.673775694,11.0,13.6,20.0,24.8,18.0
C2,496,"The sound of my shoes pounding against the pavement was a familiar one. The rhythmic beat of my feet against the concrete was a signal that I was back on the road, ready for another run. The crisp fall air was inhaled deeply, and the scent of crisp leaves filled my nostrils. I was excited to be out on this run, although it had not always been this way. Running had always been a challenge for me. I had longed to be one of the best runners on the high school track team. Still, the reality was that I was often left behind, struggling to keep up with the other runners. It seemed like no matter how hard I tried, my lack of speed held me back. It wasn't until I was diagnosed with anemia that I understood the root of my struggle. My diagnosis was unexpected, but looking back, it was also a gift. It was the catalyst that set me on a path of self-improvement, both physically and mentally. I decided it was time to take control of my health, and pushing my body and mind forward was the only way it would happen. I started taking iron supplements, which helped replenish my depleted iron levels, but it also came with a set of difficulties. My stomach seemed to reject most of the iron-rich food my mother prepared, and I often struggled to take the supplements. Nevertheless, I stuck to the plan, forcing myself to consume the iron, knowing that it was the only way to compete at higher levels. It was not an easy path, and many times I wanted to throw in the towel. However, I had made a commitment to myself, and I was determined to see it through. So, I continued to run and take my supplements and consume the nutrition my mom prepared. It was not until I looked at my running log that I noticed something incredible - my times had begun to improve! The effort was beginning to pay off! It was a turning point in my life. My journey taught me to be persistent even when the going got tough because the strength of the spirit was all that was required. The remarkable improvement sparked a fire inside me, igniting my passion and excitement for running, and I became more determined than ever. Progress wasn't rapid, and some days, progress was hardly noticeable, but any progress was good progress. It required me to push myself to endure the grueling training sessions, rain or shine, to stay on the path to improvement. Perseverance was not the only valuable lesson I learned along the way. As a runner, I always felt alone, like no one else could understand my struggles. That was until I discovered a community of runners who rallied around me, cheering me on during my accomplishments, commiserating with me post-runs. It wasn't just about competition at that point, but the sense of community that underpinned it all. Self-care was another critical lesson I took from the training that went into being a competitive runner. Months of preparation and training led to many happy moments of accomplishment, but it also put a lot of strain on me physically. The definition of self-care is now integral to my mood and demeanor. I have discovered it is crucial to rest and, crucially, to pay heed to my doctors' advice when my body sends warning signals. As I apply to institutions like Yale, Harvard, or any other institution, I know I can make an important contribution. Not because I'm a great runner, but because of the strength of character, perseverance and commitment to self-care that I have shown as someone with anemia. My journey will without question inure me to novel experiences and a new way of thinking that promises to invoke strength of spirit needed to rise up from lean moments to victory. I believe that this is invaluable and will serve me well throughout my life, well into any institution's corridors.",0,2.36258076,2.69873256,2.92160989,3.029678254,2.844695611,15.2,16.0,19.6,23.0,17.0
H,497,"A light breeze caressing the cornfield makes it look like a gentle swaying sea of gold under the ginger sun of late summer. A child’s chime-like laughter echoes. As I rush through the cornfield, I hear the rustling of leaves and the murmur of life hidden among the stems that tower over me. I remember the joy of the day when I solved one of my first difficult combinatorics problems at my parents’ house in the countryside. I felt so exhilarated that I ran outside and into the cornfield. As I was passing row after row of stems, I realized the cornfield was actually a giant matrix with thousands of combinations of possible pathways, just like the combinatorics problem I had just solved. I looked at the sky and I thought about the great mathematicians of the past that contributed so much to this field and about how I have added yet another dimension to my matrix. Suddenly, mathematics appeared to me as a 3D live map where staggering arrays of ideas connect each other by steady flows of sheer wisdom. Suddenly a loud laughter from the next room wakes me up from my reverie. I am back in my room in the drab dormitory where I lived since I was fifteen. The dim sunset barely lightens up my room, while the cold November wind rushes from the broken-and-mended-with-tape window on the hallway, whistling beneath my door. My roommates haven’t returned yet, and I feel alone and isolated. In moments such as these I always take out the ultimate weapon against gloominess: the picture of my family. I look at myself, my parents, my little sister, and my grandfather at the countryside, under a clear blue sky, hugging, sharing the joy of being together. It reminds me of the old times, when life was simpler, but it also reminds me of why I came to Bucharest to live in a dormitory. It was because mathematics fascinated me with its beautiful and intricate theories and configurations, and my parents and my family supported me 150 percent. They put in long hours at work to pay for school costs and they selflessly accepted my long absences. I decided then to honor their support, follow our common dream, and become an accomplished mathematician. Finally today I consider I matched at least an infinitesimal part of my parents’ work. After countless Olympiad stages and fierce selection programs, I managed to win a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad, along with scoring what is called “an ace”: getting gold medals in the National Olympiad, the Balkan Olympiad, and the International Olympiad. Math, for me, is a vast map of knowledge where theories intersect each other like pathways in a cornfield, and that explains the laws of nature and the universe itself. However, no matter what mathematical sphere shall I soar in, I will always have my family with me and the joy of that day when I was running freely in the cornfield.",1,2.8350409,2.999245131,3.242690436,3.584522585,3.099299849,15.2,20.6,24.6,29.4,24.0
C0,498,"Growing up, I never imagined that math could be a source of bonding with my family. I always saw it as a solitary, often frustrating, subject that required hours of tedious calculations and memorization. However, as I progressed through high school, I began to see the beauty and elegance in mathematics, and it led me down a path of discovery and connection with my family. It all began when my younger brother entered middle school and started struggling with math. My parents, both of whom have math degrees, recognized the signs of frustration and confusion in my brother's homework, and soon they were spending hours each evening hunched over textbooks, working through problem sets and equations. As an older sister, I was eager to help out in any way I could, but I soon realized that my skills and knowledge were limited. I had always been an average math student, and the advanced concepts that my brother was grappling with were beyond my abilities. But as my brother's struggles continued, I found myself drawn to the subject in a new way. I began to see math as a puzzle, a mystery waiting to be solved, rather than a chore to be completed. I started reading books about famous mathematicians and exploring the history of mathematical discoveries. And with every new concept I learned, I felt a sense of excitement and curiosity that I had never experienced before. The real turning point came when my family took a trip to New York City during my sophomore year of high school. On our last day, we visited the Museum of Mathematics, a place I had been eager to see for months. As we walked through the exhibits and watched videos of mathematicians explaining ideas and theories, I felt a sense of wonder and awe that I had never experienced before. Suddenly, math was not just a subject; it was a world of discovery and possibility, filled with fascinating concepts and applications. As we left the museum, my brother's eyes were shining with excitement. 'I never knew math could be so cool,' he said to me. 'I can't wait to learn more.' And suddenly, I realized that my newfound passion for math could be a way to connect with my brother and my parents. We started having family math nights, where we would work through problems and puzzles together, sharing our insights and discoveries. My parents would explain the concepts behind the problems, and my brother and I would try to solve them using logic and creativity. As we worked, I began to see math in a different way. I saw it as a tool for communication, a language that could be used to express ideas and explore the world around us. Rather than feeling frustrated by homework or tests, I started seeing math as a way to connect with others and understand the world in a deeper way. My newfound love of math has had a profound impact on my family dynamic. Instead of arguing over homework or test scores, we now have shared experiences and inside jokes related to math. We've developed a vocabulary of math terms and concepts that we use in everyday conversation, from discussing the geometric shapes of buildings to making calculations for recipes. But more than just being a way to bond with my family, my love of math has taught me valuable lessons about perseverance and creativity. In math, there are often many ways to approach a problem, and finding the most elegant, efficient solution requires not only analytical thinking, but also creative problem-solving skills. This has translated into other areas of my life as well; I've learned to approach challenges with a sense of curiosity and determination, seeking out new solutions and approaches. As I prepare to apply to college and pursue a career in STEM fields, I know that my passion for math and my family bonds will be a powerful force driving me forward. I understand now so much more about math, it is no longer a chore, but a world full of possibilities, where any mysteries can be uncovered with the right tools and approach. I've learned that math is not just about solving equations, but about discovering the inherent order and beauty in the world around us. And I've come to realize that math has been a way for me and my family to connect, to share our experiences and build a sense of community around a subject that once felt so solitary and frustrating. Perhaps most importantly, my love of math has taught me that anything is possible with the right mindset and support. I never thought I would find a source of connection with my family through math, but by approaching the subject with curiosity and an open mind, I discovered a shared passion that has brought us closer together. And that, more than anything, is what makes me excited to continue exploring and discovering all that the world of math has to offer.",0,2.732392332,2.958857377,3.151184338,3.418695351,3.068836651,16.2,21.0,23.0,28.8,22.0
C1,499,"Growing up, I was never particularly interested in mathematics. Instead, I spent most of my time playing sports and chasing after the latest fashion trends. It wasn't until my sophomore year of high school that I began to see the beauty and magic in math and its way of bringing people together. It began one afternoon when I was working on a particularly difficult geometry problem. I was at my wit's end, having tried every approach I could think of without success. Just as I was about to give up, a classmate approached me and offered to help. She had a different way of looking at the problem, and with her guidance, I was able to find the solution. The feeling of relief and satisfaction was immense, and I realized that math was not just about getting the right answer, but about the process of collaboration and discovery. Over the next few months, I began to delve deeper into the world of mathematics. I read books about famous mathematicians and watched documentaries about groundbreaking discoveries. And as I learned more, I began to see math as a language that could be used to unlock the mysteries of the universe. But it wasn't until I joined the math team that I fully understood the power of math as a way of bringing people together. On the team, I found a group of like-minded individuals who were just as passionate about math as I was. We spent hours each week practicing problems and discussing theories, and I began to see math as a way of building a sense of community and camaraderie. But it wasn't just my fellow mathletes who inspired me. My math teacher, Mr. Johnson, was a constant source of encouragement and support. He pushed me to explore new ideas and concepts, and his enthusiasm for math was infectious. With his guidance, I was able to tackle challenging problems that I never would have thought possible. But perhaps the most important source of inspiration came from my mother. Growing up, she had always been a role model for me, balancing a demanding career in finance with raising three children. But as I began to pursue my passion for math, I saw her in a new light. She had studied math in college, and had always encouraged me to pursue my interests, even when they were different from hers. As I began to excel in math, she became my biggest cheerleader, attending competitions and cheering me on from the sidelines. And as I prepare to embark on a career in STEM fields, I know that her support has been a crucial factor in my success. Looking back, I realize that math has been a way of connecting with people in a way that I never expected. It has taught me the power of collaboration and the importance of community, and has given me a new perspective on the world around me. And as I prepare to enter college, I know that my love of math and the support of those around me will continue to drive me forward, both personally and professionally. With the right mindset and the right support, anything is possible, and I look forward to continuing to explore this amazing world of mathematics.",0,2.606247031,2.812511764,3.052787472,3.189388937,2.891479506,14.4,16.8,21.0,24.6,20.5
C2,500,"As a child, I was captivated by the power of numbers, the symmetry of equations, and the beauty of geometry. But it wasn't until I discovered the art of origami that math truly came to life for me. The crisp folds of paper, the gentle curves of planes, and the intricate patterns revealed the magic that numbers held. Through origami, I discovered the poetry of math, its capacity to evoke emotions and capture the imagination. It was then that I realized that math was more than just a subject, it was a vibrant, polyphonic symphony of ideas. The sound of pages turning mixed with the hum of pencils scratching paper as I worked on my latest origami masterpiece. I lost myself in the creases and the bends, the twists and the turns. For hours at a time, I'd be lost in a world of intricate folds and fascinating patterns. The paper cranes, boats, and flowers that I created were more than just simple crafts; they were the manifestation of my love for math. The colors and textures of the paper were as much a part of the experience as the shapes themselves. Each piece of paper had its unique hue and feel, each with its own personality that dictated what each could become. The process of folding was tactile, with the paper almost becoming an extension of my hands. The friction between the paper fibers, and the softness of the creases, all contributed to the sensual experience. But soon, I began to move to a higher level of mathematical exploration. My father introduced me to complex geometric diagrams, pushing me to conquer more intricate origami designs. What had started as a hobby had developed into a mathematical field of study for me. I began to explore the math that lay behind each fold, diving deep into subjects such as modular arithmetic, geometry, and topology. I delved into tessellations, origami structures that could be folded infinitely, and explored the theory behind curved crease origami. The scent of fresh paper mixed with the hypnotic smell of ink as I spent countless hours pouring over books and articles, often getting lost in thought as I contemplated the theories and techniques I'd been learning. It was then that I realized that math was not just a set of rules and principles, but a means of exploring the inner workings of nature, the building blocks of our universe itself. What had started as a simple pastime became an avenue for me to explore the deepest corners of mathematical theory, and reach out to the very edges of human knowledge. But what cemented my love for math was my work in the lab. There, in a bustling research team, I learned the true value of mathematics in the real world. We worked on predictive models to understand how infectious diseases spread, and how to slow their progress. Our model was like the folds of origami, taking seemingly disparate data points and fitting them together in elegant ways, revealing a bigger picture in the final product. As we worked, there was a sense of urgency in the room as we knew all too well the implications of our work. The model we were developing could make a real-world impact; it could help save lives. The sense of purpose that coursed through the team was palpable, reminding me that, as much as math was a science or an art, it was a tool that, when harnessed, could change the world for the better. In conclusion, math is a subject that transcends the mere classroom, the mere textbook. It is an experience of the senses, an explosion of color, texture, and sound. It's a journey that demands dedication, hard work, and perseverance. It leads from simple folds to complex equations, from paper flowers to predictive models that could impact the lives of millions. I am grateful for the love of math that my father, with his geometric diagrams and challenging questions, instilled in me. And I am grateful for the passion for math that the art of origami sparked in me, driving me to pursue a future in this ever-evolving field.",0,2.646413647,2.802307766,3.042820802,3.326682976,2.902821528,15.6,17.2,20.8,23.4,19.0
H,501,"I think the most tragic part of my childhood originated from my sheer inability to find anything engraved with my name. I never had a CHAFFEE license plate on my hand-me-down red Schwinn. No one ever gave me a key chain or coffee mug with the beautiful loops of those double Fs and Es. Alas, I was destined to search through the names; longingly staring at the space between CHAD and CHARLOTTE hoping one day a miracle would occur. Fortunately, this is one of the few negative aspects of a name like “Chaffee Duckers.” My name has always been an integral part of my identity. Sure, it sounds a bit like my parents created it from a bag of Scrabble tiles, but it comes from a long-lost ancestor, Comfort Chaffee. Now it’s all mine. In my opinion, a name can make or break a person. The ability to embody a name depends on the individual. My greatest goal in life is to be the kind of unique person deserving of a name so utterly random and absurd. I began my journey in preschool. Nothing about me screamed normal. I was not prim, proper, and poised. I preferred sneaking away from my preschool classroom, barefoot, in the purple velvet dress I wore every single day to resting obediently during nap time. I grew up in a family akin to a modified Brady Bunch. Stepsisters, half sisters, stepbrothers, and stepparents joined my previously miniscule household. But in a family of plain names like Chris, Bill, John, Liz, Katherine, and Mark, I was still the only Chaffee. I was a bit of a reverse black sheep in my family. My name helped me carve an identity separate from my myriad of siblings. Instead of enriching my brain with Grand Theft Auto, I preferred begging my parents to take me to the bookstore. While my parents mandated homework time for my brothers, they never questioned my work ethic or wiretapped my assignment notebook. The thing that set me apart from the herd was that I was self-disciplined enough to take control of my own life. From the very beginning I never depended on my parents’ help or motivation to finish my schoolwork. Putting school first came naturally to me, much to the distaste and confusion of my siblings. My work ethic became known as the patented “Chaffee Method.” As I got older, I began to embody my name more and more. I didn’t want to be that girl with the weird name in the back of the class eating her hair, so I learned how to project my ideas in both written and spoken forms. I was often picked to lead classroom discussions and my complete disregard for making a fool of myself bolstered that skill. The manner in which I operate academically is perfectly described as Chaffee-esque; including but not limited to elaborate study songs, complex pneumonic devices, study forts, and the occasional John C. Calhoun costume. I take pride in the confusion on a person’s face when they first read my name. Seeing someone struggle over those two unfamiliar syllables fills me with glee. I feel as though I am adding a new word to their vocabulary. So on my last day as a page in the U.S. Senate, I prepared myself for the anticipated awkward stumbling as Senator Harry Reid thanked me by name in his closing address. But the stumble never came. I felt very humbled by his perfect pronunciation. Perhaps Chaffee is actually catching on!",1,2.341619938,2.763365386,3.004622174,3.376279758,2.888468599,9.6,12.6,20.4,23.4,16.0
C0,502,"When I was young, I used to hate my name. It was unique, but in a way that made me stand out in all the wrong ways. My classmates stumbled over it, mispronouncing it and mocking it. But as I've grown up, I've come to appreciate the importance of a unique name and the way it shapes our lives. For starters, a unique name can be a source of pride. My name is Unathi, which means 'God is with us' in isiXhosa. It's a name that's deeply rooted in my cultural heritage, and something that I now cherish. It sets me apart from my peers and makes me feel connected to my roots in a way that I might not have otherwise. Moreover, a unique name can help to define who we are. It gives us a sense of identity and can even influence our personality traits. For instance, studies have found that people with unusual names tend to be more creative and open-minded. Perhaps this is because they've had to learn to adapt and to embrace their differences from a young age. Whatever the reason, names can have a powerful impact on our sense of self. But of course, there are downsides to having a unique name too. I've had to deal with misspellings, mispronunciations, and even ridicule from classmates over the years. But rather than letting these experiences get me down, they've taught me resilience and the importance of standing up for myself. I've had to learn to correct people kindly but firmly, to take pride in my heritage and to appreciate the beauty of diversity. One of the things I appreciate most about my name is the way it connects me to my family. My mother chose my name herself, inspired by her own mother who had a similarly unique name. Knowing that my name was chosen with such care and thoughtfulness makes me feel loved and valued. It's a way for me to carry a piece of my family history with me wherever I go. Of course, having a unique name isn't for everyone, and there are certainly pros and cons to choosing an unusual moniker for your child. On the one hand, it can be a way to give them a strong sense of identity and character. On the other hand, it can make things more difficult for them in certain contexts. But above all, I believe that a unique name is a way to celebrate diversity and to honor the cultures and traditions that make us who we are. Whether it's a name rooted in your family's history, or one that simply speaks to you in a special way, there's something powerful about having a name that's truly your own. As I prepare to leave high school and embark on the next phase of my life, I know that my name will continue to play a significant role in shaping my experiences. It's a reminder of my history, my values, and my sense of self. And as daunting as it can be to have a name that's different from everyone else's, it's a challenge that I'm proud to embrace. In conclusion, having a unique name can be both a blessing and a curse. It comes with its own set of challenges, but also offers a wealth of benefits in terms of personal identity, family history, and cultural heritage. Ultimately, I believe that the importance of a unique name lies in the way it helps us to embrace diversity and to honor the traditions and values that make us who we are. And as someone who has learned to love and appreciate their own unique name, I can attest to the power that it can hold.",0,2.342651185,2.64009259,2.756665545,2.961402224,2.704045411,13.4,16.8,19.0,24.0,17.0
C1,503,"Growing up, I was never able to find anything with my name engraved on it. Unlike others, I never had a license plate, key chain, or coffee mug with 'Chaffee Duckers.' As a kid, I would stare longingly at the space between 'Chad and Charlotte,' hoping that one day a miracle would occur. But as I've gotten older, I have realized that a name is just a name, and success isn't until you define success for yourself. Despite my unique name, I believe that the ability to embody a title depends on the individual, rather than the name itself. Throughout my school years, I developed the “Chaffee Method,” which involved elaborate study songs and complex pneumonic devices to aid in understanding. I've always put schoolwork first, and this was a given due to my strong work ethic, unlike my siblings. My name has contributed towards my identity and becomes noticeably unique in my academic approach. However, it wasn't until I mentored underprivileged students that I truly understood that success cannot be defined through one’s name or expectations. I met a high schooler named Anjali, whose parents were desperately trying to mold her into a doctor or engineer. Despite the name’s meaning, success isn't all about fulfilling the expectations of others, and that it is important always to follow your heart’s desires. Anjali wanted to follow her passion for music and the arts, but her parents didn't understand her choices, out of fear of rendering her future unstable. Our long conversations lead to a suggestion for her to pursue a degree in music education, which combined her passion with a stable career. It was amazing to see the changes little conversations can make in one's life. In my high school, I co-founded a club focused on promoting coding and robotics for schools called Innovate, reflecting our mission to 'push boundaries.' We realized to make an impact would involve combining skills and knowledge to do good, rather than just make a name for ourselves. By sharing learning and resources with the underprivileged, we empowered them to dream bigger. The most rewarding experience was partnering with a local organization to teach coding to homeless teenagers. We realized that success is about skills that are attainable despite one's circumstantial barriers. As I step into college soon, I realize that success is not limited to one’s name or circumstances. Success is maximizing one's potential and impact through finding their passion to effect change positively. The journey to this point has been fueled by my parents' expectations; however, I understand now that success is discovering my passion and carving my path to leave my unique mark. As I continue my academic journey in a prestigious school like Yale or Harvard, I pledge myself to create change, impact communities and empower people to dream big since success is attainable to anybody with little resources. My parents wished for me, but success will be fulfilling my potential, creating meaningful change, and creating a life that cannot be defined by a name.",0,2.764843017,2.97867771,3.16436328,3.395569633,3.015443411,15.0,19.2,22.0,24.0,22.0
C2,504,"Growing up, I lived in an old brick house in the middle of a small town. The streets were narrow and lined with towering oak trees that tangled together like fingers. Autumn leaves swirled in eddies around my legs, and the crisp air smelled like smoke and apples. On Saturdays, the local farmer’s market hummed with life, and I helped my mother sell our homemade jams and pies. I loved the feeling of the spongy earth under my feet, the chatter of the vendors, and occasional outburst of music from nearby street performers. Those were happy times that taught me the value of simplicity, discovery, and self-expression. However, as an African-American, I realized how the world could make it hard for me to live and thrive in that happy bubble. My name and skin color dictated the world's perception of me, limiting my opportunities and expectations, making it seem as though my success was predetermined by forces out of my control. Despite the challenges, I knew that obtaining an Ivy League degree was crucial to my sense of purpose and identity. To achieve this goal, I started to focus intently on my education, using books, online resources, and even music to learn. My house quickly turned into a study space, filled with notes, textbooks, and a desk by the window. I spent hours on end pouring over programming languages, experimenting, and fine-tuning my code. Whenever I hit a roadblock, I searched and researched using open-source tools, determined to find a solution. This tenacity paid off when I became the team leader at the robotics competition, inspiring my group to reach unprecedented heights. We worked together to design, troubleshoot and debug, developing a robot that solved real-world problems. Leading the team was a nerve-wracking experience, but I derived satisfaction from transforming the team and the world around us. Ultimately, I realized that true satisfaction and success come from discovering one's passion and using it to make an impact in the world. My passion has always been technology, but I also realize the value of giving back to the community through mentorship and community development. I believe that mentorship is a key part of this process. I run tech workshops that aim to expose underprivileged youths to the world of technology from an early age. The workshops are designed to offer a holistic approach to learning, combining theory, ethics, and hands-on practice. The students get to learn how computer hardware works, programming basics, and practical exercises such as creating simple video games. As a result, I've seen a significant change in students' approach to technology, as it inspires them to explore, experiment, and create. One day, one of the students, Paul, asked me,' Can a computer really do anything in this world?' I smiled, telling him, 'Only if you're curious and determined enough to make it happen.' Paul ultimately went on to become a software engineer in a top tech firm, proof that mentorship can change lives. In summary, my journey so far has shown me that success isn't predicated on one's name or color; rather, it's about finding and pursuing what gives you meaning and direction. Success is about making an impact in some way and using the resources available to empower others to achieve their dreams. I hope to carry this perspective with me as I embark on the next stage of my academic journey. In conclusion, an Ivy League education is not just a means to an end, but a foundation for discovering oneself and making a significant positive impact in the world. The lush streets, farmer’s markets, and festivals in my small town taught me that the best things in life are often hidden in plain sight. I hope to translate this lesson into my work, finding practical solutions to complex problems, mentoring students, and working towards a more equitable future.

H,505,"I am standing behind my high school when a snowball pelts my side with a thud and splatters across my jacket, covering me with a fine, icy dust. My bewildered eyes trace the snowball’s trajectory until they fall upon a pair of snickering hoodlums crouched behind a small mountain of snowballs. They must have been waiting all afternoon for an unsuspecting student to walk by, and perhaps for emphasis, one of the boys looks me in the eye and raises a grimy middle finger. Quickly, I mold a handful of snow into a sphere with cupped hands and cock my arm back. I haven’t thrown anything in a while, but muscle memory guides me through the requisite motions. I played softball for eight years, and my athletic strength was always my throwing arm; in fifth grade, when my coach asked me to throw the ball from third to first, I hurled the ball with such force that the catch knocked him off-balance. Upon entering high school, it seemed natural that I would play on the school’s softball team. However, my body had other ideas. Throughout middle school I’d developed increasingly painful body aches, and in freshman year I awoke one morning with a brutal headache penetrating the crown of my head and the bones of my face as though a vice had been clamped to my skull overnight. After consulting more doctors than I can remember, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic widespread pain and extreme sensitivity to touch. My neurologist describes fibromyalgia as “headache of the body.” Personally, I favor my father’s description; after one particularly painful and exhausting day he aptly proclaimed, “Fibromyalgia is your body’s way of giving you the finger.” Agonizing muscle cramps mocked me constantly, preventing me from walking longer than five minutes without growing exhausted. The pressure above my eyes sneered at me whenever I attempted to read or write. Even after I found medications to temper the headaches just enough so I could return to school with sporadic attendance, sharp pains gnawed at my body with haughty derision if I even thought about returning to the softball fields and the activities I loved. For months I tried to ignore the cruel obscenities fibromyalgia hurled my way, steadfastly believing the pain would soon subside and I would achieve everything I had planned for myself if I simply disregarded the taunting aches and worked doggedly to catch up at school. But when softball season arrived, it became apparent that while determination and intelligence could preserve my GPA in the face of fibromyalgia, there was no personal attribute or skill that could heal my body and allow me to join my teammates on the field. It was time to confront the beast. In doing so, I kept in mind the schoolyard aphorism that there is strength in numbers. I did not face fibromyalgia alone, but with mathematics by my side. Baseball is a game of statistics, and if fibromyalgia threatened to steal the sport I loved through physical deterioration, I would outsmart this insolent illness and reclaim ownership of baseball through intellectual pursuits. I began a mathematical research project, analyzing the effectiveness of current baseball statistics, as well as deriving my own. Fibromyalgia forced me to redefine my goals and personal standards for success. This baseball project was my first step toward reclaiming my life and laying the foundation for victory over my illness. As calculations replaced pitching drills, my passion for baseball was channeled into a burgeoning love of science and math. Hours I had previously devoted to softball became filled with scientific journals and books, and summers I used to spend at athletic camps were devoted to research at local universities. Baseball provided a link to my pre-fibromyalgia life at a time when I desperately needed one, and through baseball I realized that if I wanted to beat fibromyalgia, I could not simply hope it would disappear overnight. Whether I modified my medications or adapted my schedule, I needed to devise my own way to face fibromyalgia’s antagonizing aches head-on. So when that taunting rascal waves his middle finger in my direction, my cheeks do not flush with angry humiliation and my legs do not run away, but my hands mold a snowball and my arm pulls back. As I follow through with my throw, pain radiating up my arm, I know instantly that I will pay for this exertion in the morning. But my icy comeback hits the sniggering boy squarely in the chest, knocking him backward into the snow as his accomplice’s mouth lies agape in shock. Well. I guess I’ve still got it.",1,2.722424155,3.092976643,3.35581531,3.779887928,3.214359593,12.2,18.4,25.6,37.8,21.0
C0,506,"Every time I reached to put on my uniform, I winced with pain. I wasn’t sure how I was going to make it through the day, let alone the game. But even though I was battling fibromyalgia, one of the most debilitating conditions a young person can have, there was one thing that gave me hope: baseball. Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition that causes widespread pain, fatigue, and cognitive issues. It’s often difficult to diagnose and even harder to treat. As a high school senior, I had already received several diagnoses that left me feeling despondent and defeated. But when I discovered baseball, something clicked. It was as if my body finally had a purpose, a reason to fight through the pain and discomfort. On the surface, baseball may not seem like the sport that would help someone deal with a chronic condition like fibromyalgia. It’s not as fast-paced as basketball or soccer, nor is it as physically demanding as football. But for me, baseball was a lifesaver. First, baseball allowed me to connect with my teammates in a way that I had never experienced before. When I stepped onto the field, I was no longer the girl who was in constant pain. I was just another player, focused on contributing to the team’s success. My teammates became my support system, and we encouraged one another to work hard and never give up. Second, baseball gave me a sense of purpose. When I was on the field, I felt like I was part of something bigger than myself. I wasn’t just playing for my own benefit; I was playing for my team and my community. Knowing that I had a role to play helped me push through the pain and keep striving for excellence. Finally, baseball taught me to deal with adversity. Fibromyalgia is not an easy condition to live with, and there were times when I felt like giving up. But every time I stepped onto the field, I was reminded that anything is possible with hard work and determination. I learned to embrace the challenges that came my way and to use them as opportunities for growth. Of course, playing baseball with fibromyalgia was not always easy. There were times when I had to sit out of practice or games because I simply couldn’t push myself any further. But through it all, I knew that I had a support system that believed in me and a sport that gave me purpose. As I look back on my high school career, I’m amazed at how much I’ve been able to accomplish despite my condition. I’ve played on championship teams, been recognized for my athletic achievements, and even earned scholarship offers from top universities. Throughout it all, baseball has been my constant companion, keeping me focused, motivated, and inspired. Now, as I prepare to leave high school and start my next chapter, I know that baseball will always be a part of my life. It’s not just a sport; it’s a way of life. It’s taught me so much about what it means to be a part of a team, to work hard despite challenges, and to never give up on my dreams. But perhaps the most important lesson that baseball has taught me is that it’s okay to ask for help. When I was first diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I felt like I had to deal with it on my own. But through baseball, I learned that it’s okay to acknowledge my limitations and to rely on others for support. Whether it was my coaches, my teammates, or my family, I learned that I don’t have to face this condition alone. As I look ahead to college and beyond, I know that there will be challenges that lie ahead. But I also know that I have the skills and mindset necessary to overcome them. Whether I’m on the field or in the classroom, I know that I can rely on the lessons I’ve learned from baseball to guide me through whatever comes my way. In conclusion, overcoming fibromyalgia with baseball has been one of the greatest achievements of my life. Although fibromyalgia will never fully go away, I’ve learned to deal with it in a way that empowers me and gives me hope. Baseball has given me purpose, taught me about resilience, and connected me with some of the best people I’ve ever known. As I move forward, I will always be grateful for the impact that this sport has had on my life.",0,2.511232851,2.691119658,2.832028104,2.966233568,2.761764948,13.0,17.0,19.0,21.0,18.0
C1,507,"Growing up with a chronic health condition was never easy for me. But, I knew I had to adapt to the changes in my life to find ways to overcome them. Although there were several aspects that helped me get through those tough times one of the most significant things that kept me going was my passion for sports. In particular, my love for baseball had an immense impact on my life in the most unexpected ways. More importantly, baseball became my solace when my body was turning against me. Similar to the author from the original essay, a day playing catch with my dad drastically transformed my life forever. When I was around nine years old, my dad took me to the local baseball field to teach me how to pitch. Despite being young, I showed immense enthusiasm towards the sport, and much to my surprise, I was a natural. From that day on, I played catch with my dad every day, trying to hone my skills even more. I watched baseball games all the time and attended the games in my town whenever possible. Little did I know it was the birth of a newfound passion. Baseball had taken over as the central focus of my life. Unfortunately, when I entered middle school, my struggles with health began to surface, and all the activities I loved came to a sudden halt. I had developed rheumatoid arthritis, which prevented me from playing sports altogether. I had never felt so helpless in my life. I couldn't walk for more than ten minutes without feeling intense exhaustion and pain. This condition made me feel like a prisoner in my own body. However, it didn't entirely quench my love for baseball. I took a different path to find a way to stay connected with the game I loved. Like the original author, I turned to the stats and strategy of the sport. I analyzed different game strategies, player statistics, scout reports, and more. It fascinated me, and it was something that I could do without worrying about my physical pain. It not only kept me engaged with the game, but it also helped me develop a love for numbers and data analysis. For years, I began studying the game, trying to become an expert when it came to baseball analytics. I watched different teams and players in the MLB, especially those with a focus on data analytics. By the time I started high school, I discovered an interest in computer science, which was an ideal way to combine my love for baseball analytics and math. Although my love for baseball never took me to the field, it led me to a completely different field - computer science. People always ask me how I deal with the restrictions that come with my disease. My response is, 'I find different ways to stay connected with the things that I love, even if I can't be active physically.' My passion for baseball led me on a different path, one that has allowed me to cultivate my love for numbers and data. It's the ultimate lesson that I have learned, a person is not defined by his restrictions or condition, but by his perseverance and the way he deals with the problems that life throws at him. To conclude, sports and hobbies can have a significant effect on an individual's life, beyond just being a form of entertainment or exercise. It can become a source of inspiration and help one find their true love in life, like in the case of the original author and myself. Through baseball, we learned valuable lessons like perseverance, dedication and mental toughness, helping us to face trials and tribulations in our lives. I am grateful for this sport, my family and my teachers who never let me give up on myself, allowing me to succeed in my aspirations.",0,2.549360967,2.788409338,2.985537034,3.136848044,2.83925938,12.0,17.0,19.4,23.0,18.0
C2,508,"Growing up playing baseball, I learned a lot about discipline, dedication, and the importance of teamwork. But more than anything else, I learned about perseverance. I learned that even when I was hurt, tired, or frustrated, I had to keep going. I learned that sometimes, the only way to get through tough times was to push myself harder than I ever thought possible. I’ll never forget the time I played in a game with a broken finger. I wasn’t sure if I could do it, but I wanted to help my team win. Every time I swung the bat, it felt like lightning shooting up my arm. Every time I caught the ball, it felt like my hand was on fire. But I didn't complain. I didn't quit. Instead, I dug deep and found the strength to keep going. And when the game was over, my team had won. That single experience taught me more about resilience than any lecture ever could. Similarly, I’ve also learned about the importance of a strong support system. When I was first diagnosed with fibromyalgia, I felt alone and confused. I wasn’t sure how to manage my pain, and I didn’t know if life would ever go back to normal. But I was lucky enough to have family and friends who supported me. Whether it was my mom driving me to doctor’s appointments, my friends cheering me up with a movie night, or my dad sitting up with me through long nights of pain, they all reminded me that I wasn’t alone. As I navigated through my diagnosis and treatment, I learned to appreciate small moments and victories more than ever before. I learned to find joy in everyday things, like the taste of a delicious meal, the sound of laughter with friends, the feeling of a warm blanket on a cold night. I learned to celebrate life’s little pleasures, even in the face of difficulty. Of course, none of this is to say that living with a chronic condition is easy. There are still days when fibromyalgia gets the best of me. There are days when I feel like I can’t get out of bed, or when I’m so tired that I can’t think straight. But even on those days, I know that I have the strength to keep going. Even when it feels like the world is against me, I know that I can lean on my support system and fight back. So why do I want to attend Yale or Harvard? Because I know that these schools will help me become an even stronger, more resilient person. They will challenge me to push myself harder than ever before, to think outside the box, and to find creative solutions to tough problems. They will teach me how to be a better thinker, a better writer, and a better leader. And they will give me the tools and resources to make an impact in the world. But most importantly, Yale or Harvard will give me a community of scholars and mentors who will support me every step of the way. They will help me cultivate the relationships and skills I need to succeed, even when the odds are against me. They will remind me that no matter how hard things get, there is always a way forward. So yes, I may have a chronic condition. But I’m also a student, a thinker, and a fighter. And with Yale or Harvard by my side, I know that I can accomplish anything.",0,2.298497946,2.517115087,2.606459851,2.887041941,2.583983455,11.0,14.0,16.0,20.0,15.0
H,509,"The backbone of my life is my writing desk. I like to describe its surface as an organized mess (despite my parents’ overdramatized description of a bomb site), a state of positive entropy and minimum energy. Math exercises overlap an organizer, set next to almost-empty tubes of paint and overdue library books. A constantly filled bottle of water sits behind a glasses’ case full of guitar picks, and carved into a mountain of paper, right in the middle, is a space reserved for my laptop—on days when I am slouching, The Complete Works of William Shakespeare needs to be slid under it. An eclectic desk shows an eclectic personality; mine has had the honor of being the training grounds prior to the Great (final) Battle (exam) of Chemistry, the peaceful meadow of relaxed reading afternoons, and all in all the pristine-turned-colorful canvas of an inquisitive mind. I remember buying it with my mother five years ago, when my bruised knees protested against the tiny white-paint-gone-yellow one I had used since childhood. My new desk was made of native Rimu heartwood—solid, resilient, dependable—a perfect role model for me to grow into. Over the years, its material became representative of my New Zealand identity, its surface slowly coated in quirky personality, and its compartments filled with treasured memories; the heartwood desk echoed my heart. At first, it did not fit with the decor of the rest of my room, which even now appears boxy and stark next to my grandiosely elegant writing desk, but its quiet strength is unafraid of individuality, just as I have learned to become. It has watched as I grew stronger branches, a straighter trunk, firmer roots; whereas I had once been but a shy young seedling, I sprouted leaves and with them the ability and yearning to provide shade for others. I have certainly physically grown into it, but although I would like to think that I have become completely independent, I remain human; in inevitable times of need, it is still my steadfast, sturdy desk that offers its support. I sit here and, well, I write: joyfully, desolately, irately, wistfully—at times paralyzed by excitement, at others crippled by fear. I scrawl notes in my organizer (which is, naturally, not in the least organized), words overflow my blog, overemotional oranges and blues plague my illustrations; shallow scratch marks indent the wood from where I have pressed too passionately into paper. It may be solid, but it is elastic enough to be shaped, resilient enough to adapt: This is my soft wooden heart. It can take it. My desk remains constant despite scars of experience—unassuming, stoic, ever watchful. Even when I dismembered dying cell phones, their frail key tones pleading for mercy, the desk stood there, nonchalant. Regardless of what fervor goes on from time to time, it knows there will eventually be a constant calm; my lively nest of rebuilt mobiles still calls this place home. Sometimes, I rest my uncertain head on its reassuring solid surface and the wood presses back into my heartbeat, communicating in Morse: “Don’t worry. Some things will never change.” And, like a mother, it always turns out to be right. Beneath my seemingly chaotic coat of papers and objects; beneath the superfluous, temporary things that define my present life, my desk and my heart remain still—solid, stable, and evergreen, ready to be written onto and scratched into by experience.",1,2.821480094,3.303179084,3.451378626,4.015634125,3.381899057,16.0,22.0,30.0,39.0,25.0
C0,510,"The sound of pencil scratching against paper is one of the most comforting sounds in the world to me. It’s the sound of ideas taking shape, of thoughts transforming into something tangible. For as long as I can remember, I have been enamored with notebooks, pens, and anything else I could use to capture my thoughts. But it wasn’t until I rediscovered my writing desk that I truly began to understand how much my passion for writing has reflected my personal growth. When I was younger, my writing desk was a mess. Piles of papers, broken pens, and half-filled notebooks littered the surface. But as I grew older, I realized that the chaos that surrounded me was a reflection of the turmoil I was experiencing inside. I was struggling to grapple with my identity, my beliefs, and my place in the world. Writing was my way of processing my thoughts and understanding my emotions, but the mess on my desk was a reflection of my inability to organize my thoughts and find clarity. As I began to gain more confidence in myself and my abilities, I started to find ways to bring order to the chaos. I cleaned off my desk, threw away old papers and pens, and forced myself to only keep what was necessary. I developed a system for organizing my ideas, color-coding my notes, and creating outlines before I started writing. And with each small step I took towards tidiness and organization, I felt myself growing more confident in my writing. But it wasn’t just the physical organization of my space that reflected my growth. My writing itself became more refined, more polished, and more meaningful. I began to embrace my own voice, my own unique perspective on the world, and I started to notice a change in the way that I wrote. Instead of simply spilling my thoughts onto the page, I began to carefully craft my words, to think critically about the impact they would have on my reader. I began to research topics, to interview people, and to take my writing more seriously than ever before. And as my writing improved, so did my self-perception. I began to see myself as a serious writer, someone who had something important to say and the skills to say it well. I found that the more I wrote, the more confident I became in every aspect of my life. Writing had always been my escape, but now it was my source of strength. The desk itself also began to change, becoming a reflection of my growth as a writer and as a person. I added small trinkets, mementos of important experiences, and photographs of loved ones. And each new addition to the desk represented a new chapter in my life, a new challenge that I had overcome or a new accomplishment that I was proud of. But despite all of the changes to my writing desk, there are still some relics of my past that linger there. The broken pen that I can never seem to throw away, the worn-out notebook with scribbles and doodles from years ago, and the faded post-it notes filled with half-formed ideas. These pieces of my past serve as a reminder of where I started, of the long journey that brought me to where I am today. Looking back on the messy, disorganized desk of my youth, I am amazed at how far I have come. And I am grateful for every step of the journey. Because the growth that happened at that writing desk was not just about my writing, but about everything that makes me who I am. What began as a means of escaping my own thoughts, became a source of empowerment and a reflection of my own personal growth. I am excited to see how my writing and my desk continue to evolve in the future, confident that each new addition will bring me closer to the person I am meant to be.",0,2.665615387,2.756852553,2.827655236,3.079068294,2.800423782,13.4,18.8,23.0,25.6,20.0
C1,511,"The sound of pencil scratching against paper is one of the most comforting sounds in the world to me. It represents the tangible transformation of my thoughts into something meaningful. For as long as I have loved writing, I have had a relationship with my writing desk, which has grown alongside me. My journey with writing has not just shaped my ability as a writer, but grown with me as I discovered more about myself, what I believe, and my place in the world. When I was younger, my desk was a cluttered mess of paper and pens, much like my thoughts. My writing was reflective of my inner turmoil; meandering thoughts struggling to break free. But as time went on, I began to understand that one could not flow without the other. The chaotic space in front of me reflected my inability to organize my mind, and intuitively, as I grew older, I began to recognize that the mess was not helpful in aiding my creative processes. Thus, I began to adopt plans and organization to reduce the distractions and chaos, colors and methods schemes so that everything had a place, and everything in its place. As I developed these systems, I noticed that my writing was more polished, refined even. It wasn't just the workspace, though; I also started being more deliberate about the words I wrote, where I articulated my voice, ideas, and perspectives. Instead of composing messy paragraphs with scattered ideas, I started having a better sense of purpose and structure to my writing. I began writing to get my ideas across to others, to inform and persuade; that's when I started viewing myself as a serious writer. My confidence grew. Not just in writing but also in my identity, I had a better understanding of who I was, and my place in the world. Time passed, and I continued refining my skills while nurturing my passion for writing. My desk also reshaped but in a different sense. Now it's adorned with knick-knacks and photos, small treasures from travels, and gifts from loved ones. Each ornament is reflective of moments in my life that I cherish, my evolution as a thinker and writer, representative of minutes, hours, and days shared with important individuals in my life. There are still pieces of my past that remain: a dried-up pen, a notebook I never finished, and yellowed post-it notes with incomplete ideas. These remnants serve as a reminder of how far I’ve come and of the journey that lies ahead. My writing journey has been one of growth and self-discovery. However, it wouldn't have been possible without my desk. It served as a constant, a reliable partner as I grew up and grew into myself. From the chaos of my early teenage years to the organized routine of my early twenties, it was there, an unfaltering support system for my creative flow. Writing has had an incredible influence on my life, affecting every aspect of who I am today. And despite my growth and achievements, I find myself grateful for every step I took both backward and forwards because they shaped the person I am now. Growing up with my writing desk has been a magical, collaborative experience. I look forward to where we go next. Like a constant ally, the desk remains ever-ready, anticipating what's next for me. I'm excited to continue growing through our relationship and hope that my growth as a person and writer shapes my desk as it has me.

C2,512,"As I sit here, reflecting on my writing journey, I can't help but notice the serene silence surrounding me. The only noise coming from my little sister's distant chatter echoing through the tiled walls of my house. The peacefulness of the moment, marking a perfect opportunity to introspect into the symbolism and parallels between my writing and my life. Just as my writing space has undergone a physical transformation, I've undergone a mental evolution. The figurative clutter that used to consume my mind was a reflection of the inadequate time I spent in introspection. A tumultuous inner voice, jumbling every word and thought, leading to a blank canvas every time I tried to articulate myself, with a feeling of inadequacy chasing me down every step. It was at this time that I sought purposeful silence, the more deliberate approach to order and organization that would free me from the clutter and get me moving. Just as my desk represented my growth from chaos to order, so did my life. I have identified my identity, my purpose, my passions, my desires, and my place in the world, my guiding principles that fuel my writing every day. In the same way, my relationships with others, my family, and friends have undergone a regeneration of sorts, having transformed from mere companions into sources of inspiration and guidance. This transformation has given me a renewed form of resilience. A resilience that runs deep into every aspect of my life. Writing has allowed me to express opinions, experiences, doubts and explore the transformative nature of life. As I sit at my desk, I am grateful for my growth and the guidance that it has brought forth in all respects of my life. All through my life, there are moments where my resilience was tested. When my grandfather passed away so suddenly, and I was forced to grapple with emotions and words that couldn't be said, writing was the tool that I used to express myself. When I was overwhelmed with the realities of life, like applying to Ivy League schools, writing's reflective nature allowed me to introspect and remind myself of why nothing short of my best would suffice. Each time, I found a way to piece together what had broken, finding strength and resilience I had no idea existed. Each anecdote can speak volumes of resilience and the power of reflection to categorize our emotions, guide our thoughts and drive us to greater heights. As it is with everything in life, writing is a reflection of who I am, the person who has transcended from mere chaos to beautiful order. Writing gave me meaning, shelter, helped me articulate, and most importantly, made me realize that the most extraordinary things ever produced originate from imperfection. Reflecting on this though paints a vision of a life in Ivy leagues, with a full-hearted craving for knowledge, resilience and an unwavering quest for greatness, for myself, for others, for society. Regarding this, I have said that my writing has grown tremendously, helping me express myself confidently and admirably. I have had the privilege of serving my community, volunteering and carrying out impactful activities that brought significant change. For one, I served as president to a community organization that significantly impacted the surrounding community, where the primary focus was on underserved children, among other impactful programs. I believe that this resilience, the ability to cling onto hope and growth amidst the chaos, is an essential ingredient to success. In Ivy Leagues, a place that challenges individuals to bring their truest, authentic, capable selves to bear and transform themselves into engaged, game-changing individuals, resilience and the capacity for introspection are essential antidotes, pillars that sustain growth. As I close, I look back at where it all began, sitting at a cluttered desk with jumbled thoughts, scribbled notes, and incomplete paragraphs. Now, here I am, a transformed writer with a more resilient outlook, who has grown through my writing, my experiences, my relationships, and my introspection. It is a journey that wouldn't have been possible without my desk, my dear writing companion, who has been an extension of myself, with each mark on a paper a reflection of my growth, struggles and triumphs.",0,2.789463277,3.060142135,3.222068872,3.504196183,3.124444845,17.6,21.6,25.4,29.4,24.0
H,513,"Languages have played a central role in my life. I have studied a variety of languages, to varying degrees — but always in the name of my greater goal, which is to understand people — to truly comprehend what lies beneath the surface: How does a culture conceive of itself? what can we learn about how the Japanese based on formality of address? What can be said about the Germans, whose language requires the verb appear at the end of a sentence? Maybe not much, but without the knowledge of the language, the possibility of real understanding is impaired. My interest in linguistics — psychology as well — derives from this belief: there is an underlying structure to all language, and through the study and comprehension of this structure, there can be a mutual understanding. Beyond the underlying structure, words themselves have a deep and rich history, and their usage is a form of beauty in itself. It was my father who opened my eye to this truth — who taught me to love words for their stories and to appreciate etymology. It began as a friendly contest between us, but for me, appreciation soon became full-fledged adoration that was only encouraged by my study of Latin. I began drawing connections I had previously missed between words I use every day, and I found myself spending hours in front of the computer looking for sites to aid me in my discoveries. One of my favorite discoveries (and an apt one to share with you) is the word ​hedera​. I happened upon ​hedera​ when I noticed the similarity among the words ​apprehend,​ ​aprender,​ and ​apprendre​, in Spanish and French, respectively. It was clear, judging by the orthography and definitions, that these words shared a Latin root, but in my studies, never had I come across such a word. Next thing I knew, I had the following on my hands: apprentice, comprehend, prehensile, apprehensive. What relationship exists between one who is learning a trade and a sense of foreboding? The answer lay within the etymologies, which led to ​hedera,​ the Latin word for ivy. Once suffixes had been stripped away, the remaining word was always ​-hendere​. Alone, the word means virtually nothing; it was contrived from ​hedera​ as a verb form to convey a sense of grasping. What better to do so than ivy, a plant known for its tenacity? I could not help but admire the ivy which had embedded itself into the foundations of language. Language is all about meaning and understanding, but to grasp the true meaning of language, one must look beyond the surface of the sentence to the structure, and even beyond that to the meaning and histories of the words themselves. Language, therefore, is my passion because it is the study of understanding.",1,2.559168192,2.740275916,2.946441106,3.278640462,2.863998883,13.4,17.0,21.0,27.4,18.0
C0,514,"It was a lazy Sunday morning, and I was sipping my tea while browsing through a book I had recently purchased on Linguistics. As I turned the pages, I realized the vastness of this subject and how it can bridge the gap between cultures and languages, just like a bridge connects two lands. As someone who has always been fascinated by words, etymology, and linguistics, I found this realization to be profound. Etymology, which is the study of the origins of words and how their meanings have evolved over time, has always been an attractive subject to me. I find it fascinating that we use words every day without realizing their origins and how they have been influenced by various cultures and languages. For example, the word 'coffee' originates from the Arabic word 'qahwah,' which means 'wine.' This fact highlights how languages have always influenced and changed each other, leading to linguistic and cultural development. Furthermore, language is a crucial component when bridging cultural gaps. It's the key to understanding and communicating with people from different backgrounds. When we learn and study others' language, a new world of understanding and communication opens up. This understanding can lead to breaking down barriers and building bridges between cultures. The study of linguistics and etymology can illuminate the past, present, and future of communication, and I am convinced that this makes it of the utmost importance. In the subject of Linguistics, one of the most important aspects is the study of grammar. Grammar is not only an integral aspect of communicating with precision and accuracy but is also essential in many fields such as journalism, law, and medicine. Furthermore, linguistics helps us understand the complexities of language itself. Without understanding the intricacies of language, miscommunication can result, leading to misunderstandings and unwanted outcomes. Studying linguistics has given me several opportunities to introduce myself to new cultures and ways of communication. During my high school years, I have had the chance to learn several languages, ranging from the Romance to the Slavic group. However, I have always found comfort in my mother tongue, Hindi. Hindi is spoken by over 600 million people worldwide, and while it may not be the most popular language, it remains a vital aspect of my identity. Interestingly, my love for Hindi led me to explore the language’s etymology and their origins. After all, learning about the roots of the words can help one make the most out of them. This curiosity about language and their roots inevitably led me to question the role it plays in social structures. Studying history has exposed me to the nuances of power structures, and language is no exception. As someone who wants to pursue a career in politics, I believe that a thorough understanding of linguistics and etymology is essential in understanding power dynamics. Language can either empower individuals or suppress them, with the wrong word choice having a significant impact in either scenario. Understanding how linguistic structures operate and how language frames and influences human thought and behavior is of utmost importance. Through my studies in linguistics and etymology, I have come to learn that words themselves are not necessarily bad, but it is how they have been used that makes them negative or positive. One example of an issue the wrong choice of words can create is the exclusion of marginalized communities. Using derogatory terms or slurs can cause humiliation and trauma, causing tension between communities. Similarly, the wrong use of a language can also cause political or diplomatic tensions which can have lasting effects. In political spheres, leader’s word choice can influence entire nations, and without an understanding of the consequences of language, the world can be plausibly plunged into chaos. However, the right use of language has the power to heal and empower people. In African-American Vernacular English, or AAVE for short, the word 'woke' has been redefined to describe someone who is socially aware and active against issues like racism or sexism. The use of this term empowers people who are fighting against injustices and has become a vital symbol for social equality. In conclusion, the study of linguistics and etymology is paramount to the development of society. It has the potential to break down barriers, foster cultural understanding, and even influence politics. Words have the power to unite or divide people and communities, and a thorough understanding of their origins and nuances is essential. Amongst all the subjects I have studied in my high school career, this discovery of a new world of knowledge has been the most profound to me, and I am convinced that the influence of language will only increase in the coming years.",0,2.701739015,2.863750789,3.069712127,3.254434612,3.038554596,14.6,17.2,19.8,26.0,19.0
C1,515,"Languages are the tool we use to communicate with people, ideas, and the world. It is this idea that has drawn me to the study of linguistics and language acquisition. Growing up, I was always fascinated by languages, the different sounds, and the seemingly otherworldly way that one word can have such different meanings in different languages. I remember my first day of Spanish class vividly, I was scared, but even then, I knew that I was embarking on a journey that would change my life. Since then, I have studied several other languages and have come to understand how language is an integral part of our lives and how it shapes the way we experience the world. One aspect of linguistics that I find particularly fascinating is how languages are structured. Each language has its own phrase structure and rules, and it is the study of these rules that helps us understand the intricacies of language that one might miss in casual conversation. Once one has understood the structure of a language, it becomes easier to understand its speakers and their culture on a much deeper level, which is crucial in being cognizant of the subtle nuances of communication. Moreover, grammar, which is the backbone of every language, is one of the most critical aspects of language acquisition. Speaking and writing with correct grammar can often be the difference between being taken seriously or not. Studying grammar has allowed me to understand the relationships between words and how a single sentence can be constructed in several different ways, each conveying a different meaning. Grammar is as artistic as it is technical, and in perfecting it, I have found a new level of appreciation for the artistry of language. In my journey to learn new languages, I have discovered that language acquisition is not just the memorization of words but learning about the culture that informs them. Words can reveal so much about the people who speak them, their beliefs and their traditions. For example, in Arabic, the word “salam” (سلام) means peace, just like in Hebrew “shlom” (שלום). It is fascinating to see how two different cultures can adopt similar words to describe the same concept, highlighting that the idea of peace is universal. Languages and cultural nuances become even more apparent if one looks at historical languages which have existed for centuries. Latin, one of the most fascinating languages, has been practically dead for centuries. However, its influence persists to this day as it laid the foundation for the Romance languages. During my study of Latin, I learned that it is not just a language, but a whole civilization that is being studied. Latin was spoken by some of the greatest minds in history like Julius Caesar, Cicero, and Vergil. Although Latin’s influence has waned, its impact can be seen in every text, in every Romance language, and in every legal text. Apart from personal curiosity and academic interests, I believe linguistics can make governance and diplomacy more effective. Every politician knows that the right word at the right time can have a significant impact on people's perceptions, but an understanding of linguistics can enhance this ability to communicate. Many issues arise due to miscommunication, and by understanding the nuances of language better, leaders can avoid potential misunderstandings that could shape the course of the world's events. In conclusion, the study of linguistics and language acquisition can shape an individual's understanding of the world, and their place in it. It allows one to connect with people from different cultures, breaks down barriers, and can even transform their career. It has given me a newfound appreciation for language, communication, and culture. I look forward to further exploring the world of linguistics and its endless possibilities in the future.",0,2.796593234,2.939235911,3.095086675,3.328556885,3.051447885,16.0,17.4,22.0,28.0,19.0
C2,516,"I remember the first day of Spanish class, sitting in the back, feeling my palms sweat, and hearing my heartbeat thrum in my ears. The teacher, with his animated gestures and unwavering smile, strode towards the whiteboard and wrote the word 'hola' in bold letters. As he spoke, I felt a pang of wonder, imagining the endless possibilities of all the other words I could learn to share, converse and communicate with people beyond my linguistic territory. Intrigued, I began to delve deeper into the study of linguistics, understanding how the structure of language shapes communication. I discovered that grammar and sentence structure are the backbone of every language. In studying phrase structure and syntax, I understood how languages reveal an intricate system of communication that goes beyond merely speaking or writing. I began to appreciate the artistry of language acquisition. As my knowledge of linguistics deepened, an exciting world of culture and expression was opened up before me. Culture and language are inseparable: they embody each other and, through their shared evolution, reveal the history and the essence of the speaker's heritage. Words can reveal truths about different societies, beliefs, and traditions. For instance, the Arab word “salam” (سلام), which means peace, draws parallels with the Hebrew word “shalom” (שלום), which reveals that the idea of peace is universal and shared across cultures. Learning about ancient languages like Latin allowed me to travel back in time and explore the civilization that it represents. Latin has been dead for centuries, and its impact might seem minimal. However, its influence persists to this day as it laid the foundation for the Romance languages. During my study of Latin, I learned that it is not just a language, but a whole civilization that is being studied. Latin was spoken by some of the greatest minds in history like Julius Caesar, Cicero, and Vergil. Although Latin’s influence has waned, its impact can be seen in every text, in every Romance language, and in every legal text. It is proof of how the threads of communication can stitch together the fabric of society. Linguistics is not just an academic pursuit; it has real-world implications. In today's rapidly changing world, communication is as important as ever. By understanding the intricacies of language better, an individual can avoid potential misunderstandings that could shape the course of the world's events. Every politician knows that the right word at the right time can have a significant impact on people's perceptions. Although spoken with ease, the ramifications of linguistic exchanges can be profound. Their mastery requires an understanding of structure, syntax, nuance, and culture. As I continue to develop as a student of linguistics, I know that I have only scratched the surface of the possibilities that language acquisition holds. It has opened up doors of perception and understanding of people and their world that I could never have imagined. It has also given me a newfound appreciation for language, communication, and culture that I will carry with me throughout my life. Languages are the tools we use to communicate with people and the world, allowing us to break down ideological barriers, build relationships, and share our unique human experiences.",0,2.69230592,2.837914132,3.099325152,3.297475418,2.968057961,12.0,17.8,21.2,23.6,19.5
H,517,"Ut Italiam laeti Latiumque petamus' 'Sandra, would you mind reading the next few lines and translating them for us?' The professor glanced at me, a kind glimmer in his bespectacled eyes. I gulped. I was in a classroom of eighteen, five of whom were high school Latin teachers. And I was supposed to recite and translate Livy's Ab Urbe condita — with elisions! After fumbling through a few words and mistaking a verb for a noun, I finished the first sentence. I skimmed the second line, looking for the main verb. Singular. I searched for a singular noun and pieced the two together. Then, I noticed an accusative and added it as a direct object. As I continued, a burst of exhilaration shot through my body. My eyes darted across the page, finding a verb, a noun, and objects. I reached the end of the passage and grinned, relief pulsing in my veins. 'Very good!' The professor beamed at me before selecting his next victim. A few months ago, I never would have imagined myself sitting in Harvard's Boylston Hall this summer for six hours a week, cherishing the ancient literature of Rome. Even though the professor decided I was eligible for the course despite not taking the prerequisite, I was still nervous. I worked hard in the class, and it reminded me just how much I love the language. Translating has always given me great pleasure and great pain. It is much like completing a jigsaw puzzle. Next, I look for phrases that connect the entire clause — does this adjective match this noun? Does this puzzle piece have the right shape? The middle of the sentence is the trickiest, full of convoluted dependent clauses, pieces colored ambiguously and with curves and edges on all four sides. I am sometimes tangled in the syntax, one of the worst feelings in the world. After analyzing every word, I try to rearrange the pieces so they fit together. When they finally do, I am filled with a satisfaction like no other. Translating forces me to rattle my brain, looking for grammatical rules hidden in my mind's nooks and crannies. It pushes my intellectual boundaries. No other language is as precise, using inflection to express gender, number, and case in just one word. When I pull apart a sentence, I am simultaneously divulging the secrets of an ancient civilization. Renowned scholars are telling the stories of their time through these words! No other language is as meticulous. Every line follows the same meter and the arrangement of every word is with a purpose. The story of Pyramus and Thisbe includes a sentence where the word 'wall' is places between the words 'Pyramus' and 'Thisbe' to visually show the lovers' separation. Translating is like life itself; the words are not in logical order. One cannot expect the subject of a sentence to appear at the beginning of a clause, just like one cannot plan the chronology of life. Like the delayed verb, we do not always know what is happening in our lives; we just know it is happening. When translating we notice the nouns, the adjectives, and the conjunctions just like we see the people, senses, and connections of our lives. However, we often do not know what we are doing and ask ourselves the age-old question: Why are we here? Perhaps we are here to learn, to teach, to help, to serve, to lead, or just to live. We travel through life to decide what our purpose is, and it is that suspense and our unknown destinies that make the journey so irresistibly beautiful. I feel that same suspense and unknown when I translate, because I am beautifully struggling to unlock a past I know very little of. It is unbelievably exhilarating. Thus, I question why others consider Latin a dead language. It is alive in all of the Western world. The Romance languages of French, Spanish, and Italian all have Latin origins. Without Latin, I would not be able to write this essay! It is alive in the stories it tells. You may see an apple and associate it with orchards, juice, pie, and fall. When I see an apple, I think of the apple of discord thrown by Eris that ultimately caused the Trojan War. This event, albeit destructive and terrifying, leads to the flight of Aeneas and eventually, his founding of Rome. I study Latin for its rewarding return, incredible precision, intellectual challenge, rich history and culture, and deep influence on our world. I study Latin to show others how beautiful it is, to encourage the world that it should be valued. I study Latin to lead our society, like Aeneas did, toward a new city, a new dawn where everyone appreciates a mental trial of wits, everyone marvels at a vibrant past, and no one wonders whether Latin is dead or not.",1,2.253672535,2.447372644,2.709755353,3.176005031,2.577138773,10.0,12.2,16.8,20.4,14.5
C0,518,"Throughout my high school years, I’ve had an interest in learning Latin, a language that is often regarded as a “dead” one. However, to me, it has been more like an adventure than just a language course. Latin is the foundation of many modern Romance languages, including Italian. This is what led me to take my Latin journey to Italy. It was a long journey, not only because of the distance but also because it was a journey of discovery, both of myself and of the language. When I first began my Latin studies, I was intrigued by the fact that it was a language that nobody around me spoke. I was drawn to the idea of learning a language that was steeped in history and was the basis of so many modern tongues. But it was also a challenge, and for a while, I felt like I was hitting a brick wall. My Latin teacher, Ms. Anderson, had a unique teaching style that focused on the language's historical context. Through her, I realized that Latin wasn’t just a language; it was a window into the past. This ultimately led me to explore the language’s journey from ancient Rome to modern-day Italy, the country in which it had the most significant presence. In the summer of my junior year, I convinced my parents to take a trip to Italy, promising them that I would be their tour guide. I couldn’t wait to immerse myself in the country, experience its culture firsthand, and hone my Latin skills in conversations with locals. Upon our arrival, we headed straight to Rome, the heart of the Latin language. Walking around the Roman Forum, I felt a sense of wonder and awe, knowing that these ruins were once part of the most powerful empire in the world. As I stood in the midst of it all, I couldn't help but think about the history and culture that I had learned through the Latin language. It was as if the ruins came to life before my eyes, and I could hear the sounds of the people from centuries ago speaking Latin. Italy had a sense of excitement and beauty that I had never experienced. The food, the architecture, and the people were all incredibly vibrant and fascinating. I wanted to learn more about every aspect of the country, but my focus remained on the Latin language. One evening, my family and I found ourselves at a small, remote pizzeria outside of Rome. As we were enjoying our meal, I noticed a group of locals engaged in conversation at a nearby table. I carefully approached them and asked if they could help me with my Latin. For the first few moments, they looked at me as if I had lost my senses. But once they realized my curiosity was genuine, they were happy to engage with me, and we spent the rest of the evening conversing in Latin. That moment made me realize that Latin, though technically a “dead language,” was still a way to bridge cultures and connect people from different backgrounds. As I continued to travel through Italy, I made it a point to speak as much Latin as possible. But beyond that, I found myself wanting to learn more about modern Italy and its rich culture. I wanted to see the places that had evolved from the wealth of ancient Rome and to understand how they had developed into the country I was now experiencing. In Florence, I was struck by the sheer beauty of the city's architecture and how much of it was influenced by the Roman Empire. It was a reminder of how intertwined Roman history is within Italian history. But it was the cuisine that I found most fascinating. Every bite of pasta or sip of wine told a story informed by Roman culture. Suddenly, I saw the language in a different light. It wasn't just a way to communicate but a key to understanding a whole other culture. My Latin journey to Italy taught me that language is so much more than what is on the surface. Latin isn't just a language; it's a gateway to understanding the world. Through this language, you can connect with others, understand history, and learn about culture. Latin may be thought of as a dead language, but to me, it's a language of the past, present, and future. This journey has not only taught me about the importance of language, but it has also taught me about myself. I have learned the value of pushing past my comfort zone, asking for help, and following my curiosity. The journey has helped me realize that I am capable of more than I thought, and that in taking an unconventional path, we can often find the most profound experiences. As I begin my college journey, I hope to continue exploring the world through language, culture, and history. And who knows? Maybe I will even find myself on another Latin journey, discovering the root of yet another beautiful language.",0,2.612924041,2.802149008,2.961743648,3.114128791,2.855390406,13.8,17.0,19.0,25.0,18.0
C1,519,"As a high school senior who seeks to immerse oneself in the beauty of language, I've been drawn to the study of Latin. Although ancient and often considered a 'dead' language, I see Latin as a language full of life and beauty, and one that has left a lasting impression on our modern world. Latin is a language that has been around for centuries, and it has played an influential role in shaping the world's languages, including the Romance languages of French, Italian, and Spanish. However, Latin's significance reaches far beyond just its contribution to language. It permeates science, medicine, and law, making it a vital part of our society. To fully appreciate Latin, one must immerse in its intricacies and gain an understanding of its grammar and structure. Its grammar is a mathematical-like system composed of a clear set of rules, making it challenging yet incredibly rewarding to learn. The language's rigidity is offset by its adaptability, giving it a balance between logic and artistry. One of Latin's most striking features is its ability to convey emotions and meaning through its word endings. The choice of a particular case ending or tense can significantly impact the meaning of a sentence, and the use of a specific adjective or adverb can convey a character's personality. But Latin's beauty doesn't stop at grammar and syntax. It extends to its literature as well. Epic poems like 'The Aeneid' tell stories of adventure and sacrifice that have resonated with readers for centuries. Latin's literary legacy lives on, inspiring countless poets, writers, and composers to this day. And the study of Latin goes beyond its historical and artistic relevance. Latin is still significant in our modern world, and the study of Latin instills a sense of discipline and rigor in its learners. Science and medicine rely heavily on Latin root words for terminology, and the legal profession still uses Latin to define legal concepts and phrases. Thus, a thorough understanding of Latin can help students excel in various fields. In my quest to master Latin, I have encountered numerous obstacles, but my dedication to learning has taught me discipline and patience. The language requires a careful study in which every sentence takes time to decipher, and each grammatical concept calls for attentive consideration. However, the exhilaration of mastering Latin's complex rules and translating its literature makes the effort worthwhile. Lastly, Latin has a timeless quality that transcends time, connecting us to the past and the societies that spoke it. By studying Latin, I am not only learning a language but also unfurling our understanding of ancient cultures that have shaped our world. In conclusion, Latin is more than just an ancient, academically challenging language. It is a vessel for expressing emotion, a tool for precision, and a conduit that connects us to the past. The study of Latin has much to offer, from its contribution to modern fields, to the intellectual benefits of language learning, and to its significance in literature and art. Therefore, to those seeking to explore a language with a rich cultural heritage and vast practical applications, I wholeheartedly recommend the study of Latin. It can open doors to a new world of intellectual exploration and appreciation, and it can also lead to lifelong learning and personal growth.",0,2.825131987,2.992260975,3.155970948,3.451477688,3.117275615,13.4,18.0,22.0,24.0,20.0
C2,520,"The first time I walked into the Latin classroom, I was greeted by the smell of old books and polished wood. The room was dimly lit, with just enough light to illuminate the stacks of textbooks and the blackboard at the front of the classroom. As I sat down at my desk, I couldn't help but feel a sense of anticipation. I was about to embark on a journey that would take me through centuries of human thought and emotion. Each Latin class greeted me with a new challenge. The language was both familiar and foreign, with a rhythmic cadence that seemed to echo through the halls of history. As I delved deeper into Latin, I encountered the beauty of its grammar and structure. It was a language that demanded precision and rewarded careful consideration. With each new word and sentence, I felt myself inching closer to the heart of the language, untangling its mysteries and discovering its secrets. But Latin was more than just a language to me. It was a window into the past, a glimpse of ancient worlds that had long since disappeared. As I read Virgil's epic poem, 'The Aeneid,' I was transported to a world of gods and heroes, of battles and love. The poem was a masterpiece of human emotion, written in a language that could capture the subtleties of human feeling with unparalleled elegance and grace. It was a reminder of the power of art to connect us to our common humanity, to bring us closer to one another across time and space. In Latin class, I learned more than just the language itself. I learned the value of discipline and perseverance. Latin demanded a kind of intellectual rigor that was both humbling and exhilarating. Each new concept required precision and careful consideration, and each mistake was an opportunity to learn and improve. Through Latin, I discovered the joy of intellectual pursuit, of the thrill of pushing my mind to new heights and discovering new insights. But the significance of Latin extends far beyond the classroom. It is a language that has left an indelible mark on human history, shaping our world in countless ways. Latin roots and phrases still permeate the language of science, medicine, and law. Latin has left an enduring legacy in literature, inspiring generations of writers and poets to create works of art that transcend time and space. It has helped to define our understanding of civilization, of art, and of what it means to be human. As I look back over my years of studying Latin, I realize that it has taught me more than just a language. It has taught me the value of rigorous intellectual pursuit, of the importance of preserving the treasures of human culture, and of the power of art to connect us to our common past and our shared humanity. It has enriched my understanding of the world and my place in it, and has broadened my horizons in ways that I never could have imagined. In conclusion, I urge all those seeking to widen their intellectual and cultural horizons to consider the study of Latin. It is a language full of richness and beauty, a language that demands precision and rewards careful consideration. It is a language that has shaped our world in countless ways, leaving an enduring legacy of wisdom and creativity that continues to inspire and enrich us today. The study of Latin is not just an academic pursuit, but a journey that takes us through the heart of human thought and emotion, and connects us to our common past and our shared humanity.",0,2.605220549,2.842664434,3.107156589,3.381721027,2.970940914,13.0,18.0,21.0,24.0,19.0
H,521,"Language is not the sole domain of humans. Animals also talk, and over the last few years I have been fascinated by learning two new languages that even foreign language school students have never heard of. Studying animal languages is very different from learning Korean, Chinese, or Spanish. There are always dictionaries to refer to when I learn human languages, but when learning animal languages I don't have a Google translator to spit out satisfactory answers. In fact, I have to use my own judgment, which combines my mind, heart, and instinct to interpret what I hear. Tree frogs, specifically Japanese tree frogs and Suweon tree frogs, use songs not just to express their amorous intentions but to survive. While these two species may look physically identical, they are sexually incompatible. So in order to lure the right female, male frogs sing serenades that are distinguishable from other species. Analyzing these serenades at an ecology lab with spectrograms and waveforms, I decoded every pulse of sounds emitted by these ravenous tree frogs into the patterns of numbers to let humans understand their lyrics. Unlike frogs' mating songs, bats use language not only to communicate but also to navigate and locate insects at night. While flying, bats shoot out biosonar sounds and listen to the echoes that bounce off obstacles to grasp the world around them. Visualizing a world just with sound, I was enchanted by their invisible language when I studied the Greater Horseshoe bat's supersonic echolocation at a wildlife conservation lab. When bats cast nets of invisible words every millisecond during free flight and ziplining experiments, we captured and revealed their dialogue that had neither conjugations nor grammar. After eavesdropping on tree frogs' and bats' conversations, I discovered that they use languages for survival. The language of the frogs exemplifies power — the stronger and bigger a frog is, the louder it can sing, scaring off all its prey and bravely exposing itself to predators. And for bats, their invisible language is their vision. They silently scream out for help and listen carefully as nature's echoes guide their path. In a sense, animals communicate with other species and with nature. On the other hand, humans have developed esoteric words, convoluted sentences, and dialects to express their sophisticated ideas and feelings. This amazing evolution has, I believe, isolated us from nature. Now we prefer to live away from wildlife, tending to communicate only among other Homo sapiens sapiens through texts, tweets, and e-mails. Taking a page from Dr. Dolittle's pocket diction, I hope that my work helps us broaden our anthropocentric minds and understand animals who also share our biosphere. If our souls are reconnected with nature, maybe we could hear Mother Nature whisper some secrets about her mysteries that we are too wired or unaware to heed. Early explorers boldly left the comforts of their homeland to learn the languages and traditions of other cultures. Due to their dedication, these self-taught bilinguals were able to bridge cultures and share values between different communities. In the same way, I want to take risks in learning to communicate with other species beyond human beings and become a multilingual biologist who connects human and animal realms. I wish to venture into the animal kingdom and become a pioneer in mastering and sharing nature's occult dialects with our species. When we finally learn to comprehend and harmonize with nature, we humans might become more humane.",1,2.765996622,3.055727401,3.198587975,3.505613029,3.118219082,13.2,18.0,22.0,27.6,20.5
C0,522,"It is no secret that animals possess different communication styles that allow for their survival. These communication styles, or languages, have evolved over time to fit the specific needs of an animal's lifestyle. From primates utilizing facial expressions and vocalizations to birds creating complex songs, the ways in which animals convey messages are truly fascinating. As someone who grew up with a love of animals, I have spent countless hours studying different communication methods and their implications. From observing gorillas' social interactions in their natural habitat to decoding whale songs in the ocean, I have come to appreciate the importance of animal languages for survival. One animal language that has always intrigued me is the honeybee dance. This dance, known as the 'waggle dance,' is utilized by honeybees to communicate the location of a food source. In this dance, the bee moves in a figure-eight pattern and waggles its body to indicate the direction and distance of the food source in relation to the sun. Although the honeybee dance may seem like pure entertainment, it serves as a vital method of communication for the survival of a colony. However, not all animal languages are as straightforward as the honeybee dance. Many animals, especially primates, utilize a combination of vocalizations and body language to communicate a range of emotions and ideas. For example, chimpanzees use facial expressions, posture, and vocalizations to convey their mood to other members of their troop. This complex system of communication allows chimpanzees to form alliances, settle misunderstandings, and even express empathy. But why is the study of animal languages important for us as humans? By understanding animal communication, we can gain a greater appreciation for the interconnectedness of all living species. We can also learn valuable lessons about the importance of communication and social dynamics in our own lives. I have seen the significance of this interconnectedness firsthand during my travels to Africa, where I had the opportunity to visit conservation centers for primates. While there, I witnessed the remarkable bond between the caretakers and the primates. Despite the language barrier, the caretakers were able to understand the primates' needs and wants through careful observation of body language and vocalizations. This experience solidified my admiration for the power of communication in bridging the gap between different species. While animals and humans may speak different languages, we are all capable of understanding and empathizing with one another through careful observation and consideration. In conclusion, the study of animal languages for survival has opened my eyes to the intricate methods by which different species communicate with one another. From the honeybee dance to the complex vocalizations of primates, these communication methods serve as essential tools for survival. However, the significance of animal languages extends far beyond survival. By understanding these methods of communication, we can learn valuable lessons about our own social dynamics and the importance of empathy and understanding in bridging differences. Ultimately, the study of animal languages reminds us of the interconnectedness of all living species and the importance of communication in achieving harmony and understanding in the world around us.",0,2.800652379,2.980865546,3.115039641,3.356889818,3.039277838,15.0,18.0,22.0,25.0,19.0
C1,523,"The world is full of languages - some we understand, while others remain a mystery. As much as humans have developed sophisticated words, dialects, and complex sentences, the richness of animal communication is equally complex and diverse. I am fascinated by animal communication and have spent time studying it extensively. As I understand, studying animal communication requires a different approach than studying human language, requiring my mind, heart, and instinct to interpret what I see. One of the most intriguing aspects of animal communication is how different species use it for survival. For example, after studying Japanese tree frogs and Suweon tree frogs, I discovered that these ravenous tree frogs use their serenades not just to express their amorous intentions but also to survive. These species might look identical, but they are sexually incompatible. The male frogs have to sing songs that are distinguishable from other species to lure the right female. Using spectrograms and waveforms, I decoded every pulse of sounds emitted by these frogs into the patterns of numbers to let humans understand their lyrics. Bats are also fascinating creatures that use language not only to communicate but also to navigate and locate prey at night. Their biosonar sound echoes bounce off obstacles that help bats to grasp their surroundings while navigating. Studying Greater Horseshoe bat's supersonic echolocation at a wildlife conservation lab, I became enchanted by their invisible language when I saw them shoot their nets of invisible words every millisecond during free flight and ziplining experiments. We captured and revealed their dialogue that had neither conjugations nor grammar. These creatures use languages for survival, unlike humans who have developed esoteric words to express sophisticated ideas and emotions. It is intriguing how animal communication is embedded in nature, and how some species use their language skills for survival. For instance, when tree frogs sing loudly, they capture prey while scaring away predators. Similarly, bats' invisible language is their vision, helping them to hunt prey easily. Humans, on the other hand, have evolved to communicate with other humans through complex sentences and dialects, isolating themselves from nature. As we continue to neglect the natural world, animal communication teaches us to widen our anthropocentric perspective by understanding other species. We tend to communicate only among ourselves through social media, emails, and texts, distancing ourselves away from wildlife. For instance, early explorers left their homeland to learn other cultures' languages and traditions, bridging cultures, and sharing values between communities. By learning to communicate with other species beyond Homo sapiens sapiens, I strive to become a multilingual biologist who connects humans and animal realms. Another exciting aspect of animal communication is how it sheds light on the richness and diversity of the natural world, challenging us to rethink our place in it. For example, bees use intricate dances to communicate locations of food sources and to coordinate activities such as building and maintaining the hive, defending against predators to create complex social structures. Similarly, primates use communication to establish social hierarchies, and gorillas and chimpanzees have vocalizations, which they use to convey different messages or greet each other. The study of animal communication poses critical questions about the nature of language and the broader implications of communication beyond human species. Can animals learn and use language? What are the cognitive and emotional capabilities of non-human animals? These are vital questions for conservation efforts, highlighting the significance of social and emotional needs while considering non-human animals' physical needs. In conclusion, pursuing a degree in animal communication will contribute to conservation efforts and challenge us to understand the natural world. It is interdisciplinary and unique, offering a fresh perspective on the natural world. As I watch my dogs play and communicate with each other in their unique way, I feel a sense of responsibility to understand, connect, and communicate with other species meaningfully.

C0,526,"Competition and innovation are two concepts that go hand-in-hand, driving progress and development in various fields. However, manhunt, the activity of tracking down and apprehending fugitives or suspects, is a unique domain where the relationship between these concepts can be complicated. On one hand, manhunt is a necessary practice for law enforcement to ensure the safety of society and the administration of justice. On the other hand, manhunt can sometimes become a form of competition between law enforcement agencies or individuals, leading to questionable methods and outcomes. Having grown up in a rural area, I have witnessed firsthand how manhunt operations can both benefit and harm communities. I vividly remember the summer of 2015 when a notorious drug lord was on the run in our region. The manhunt that ensued involved multiple agencies, including the FBI, state police, and local sheriff's offices. While the operation resulted in the apprehension of the individual, it also left many residents traumatized and fearful due to the heavy presence of SWAT teams and militarized vehicles in their neighborhoods. This experience made me contemplate the balance between competition and innovation in manhunt operations. While competition can drive innovation and ensure that the most effective methods are employed, it can also lead to unnecessary escalation and negative consequences for communities. This realization led me to research the practices and policies surrounding manhunt operations in the United States. Through this research, I discovered that manhunt is a highly competitive practice within law enforcement agencies. The need to apprehend suspects quickly and efficiently puts pressure on individuals and teams to outdo their peers. Agencies also compete for resources and funding, leading to the adoption of advanced technology and tactics. However, this competition can lead to concerning outcomes. For example, in 2013, the Boston Marathon bombing resulted in a massive manhunt for the perpetrators. While the eventual capture of the suspects was celebrated, the tactics employed by law enforcement raised questions about the use of excessive force and violation of civil liberties. The aggressive sweep of neighborhoods and homes left residents feeling as if they were under siege, causing distrust and tension between law enforcement and communities of color. The need for innovation in manhunt operations is undeniable. The use of technology such as thermal imaging cameras, drones, and sophisticated databases can aid in the quick apprehension of suspects. However, the use of this technology must be balanced with ethical considerations to prevent overreach and violation of civil liberties. One area where innovation and competition can have a positive impact is in the training and education of law enforcement officers. The development of robust training programs that emphasize communication and de-escalation tactics can improve the safety of suspects and officers alike. Simultaneously, incentivizing individuals and teams to achieve high performance through recognition and rewards can encourage innovation and collaboration. Ultimately, the competition and innovation in manhunt must be balanced with sensitivity towards the impact on communities. Law enforcement agencies must prioritize the safety and well-being of residents while still achieving their objectives of capturing suspects. As a high school senior with an interest in criminal justice, I aspire to bring fresh perspectives and ideas to the field. I believe that increased collaboration between law enforcement, community leaders, and stakeholders can facilitate sustainable innovation in manhunt operations. The adoption of community policing philosophies can help restore trust between law enforcement and communities, leading to successful manhunts that do not leave lasting trauma. In conclusion, competition and innovation in manhunt operations are essential, but their impact on communities must be considered. The use of technology and training should prioritize the practical and ethical implications of its implementation. The importance of collaboration and community involvement cannot be stressed enough, as manhunt operations affect every part of society. The balance of competition, innovation, and sensitivity is the key to successful manhunts that prioritize the well-being of all involved.",0,3.153931375,3.247167685,3.387133822,3.553398293,3.328241593,16.0,18.0,20.0,23.2,19.0
C1,527,"As I sat in my bedroom, staring at the blank screen in front of me, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pressure. I was writing my college essay, trying to craft the perfect words that would impress the admissions officers at schools like Yale and Harvard. But as I struggled to find the right words, my mind wandered back to that game of manhunt all those years ago. In that moment, it occurred to me that the principles of competition, innovation, cooperation, and collaboration that I had learned on that fateful night were just as relevant to my college application as they were to the game of manhunt. Like in manhunt, college admissions is a competitive game. Everyone is vying for a spot at the top schools, trying to outdo each other in extracurricular activities, grades, and test scores. But just like in manhunt, the key to success is not to focus solely on beating the competition, but also to innovate and push the boundaries of what is expected. As I wrote my essay, I tried to emulate this same spirit of innovation. Instead of simply regurgitating my achievements and activities, I tried to find a unique angle that would make me stand out from the thousands of other applicants. I talked about my love of jazz and how I constantly sought to find new musical perspectives and styles, just like how I seek out new trees to climb in manhunt. I talked about the importance of cooperation and collaboration in all of my pursuits, not just trying to outdo my peers but also lifting them up with me. But most importantly, I tried to infuse my essay with the same sense of passion and excitement that I felt during that game of manhunt. After all, the admissions officers at Yale and Harvard are not just looking for the applicants with the highest grades and most impressive activities - they're also looking for people who are truly passionate about what they do. In manhunt, my love of competition and innovation was palpable, reflected in the adrenaline pumping through my veins as I darted through the forest. And in my essay, I wanted to convey that same sense of excitement, that same sense of purpose. As I read over my final draft, I couldn't help but feel a sense of nervousness. Was it good enough? Would it impress the admissions officers? But then I thought back to that game of manhunt, and I realized that ultimately, it's not about beating the competition or impressing others. It's about finding what you love and pursuing it with all your heart. Whether it's a game of manhunt in the woods with friends or a college essay that could change the trajectory of my life, the key is to stay true to yourself and to always strive for more. It may be a competitive game, but ultimately, the rewards go to those who push themselves to their limits, embrace innovation, and collaborate with others along the way. The lessons of manhunt are just as applicable to college admissions as they are to any other pursuit, and I am grateful for the skills and mindset it instilled in me.",0,2.573670361,2.993361346,3.250612793,3.543833035,3.133305419,14.8,23.6,25.4,30.6,24.0
C2,528,"The sun was setting as we gathered on the edge of the forest, ready for the game of manhunt that would define our childhood years. The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, and the sound of birds singing their evening songs filled the air. I still remember the rush of excitement I felt as I tore through the forest, dodging behind trees and rocks, trying to avoid being caught by the opposing team. My heart was pounding in my chest as I pushed myself to run faster, jump higher, and climb higher than I ever thought possible. But even in the midst of this intense competition, there was a sense of collaboration and cooperation that was just as important. We were not just trying to outdo each other, but also to work together to achieve a common goal - to win the game. This sense of collaboration has guided me throughout my life, both in my extracurricular pursuits and in my academic studies. It is what has driven me to seek out new perspectives, to learn from others, and to always push the boundaries of what is expected. In high school, I was able to apply this same mindset to my passion for jazz music. I joined the school jazz band, feeling a sense of excitement as I improvised solos and experimented with new techniques. Just like in manhunt, the key was not just to outdo my peers but to work together with them, listening to their ideas and incorporating them into my own playing. Our collective efforts resulted in performances that were greater than the sum of their parts, driven by a shared love of music and a collective desire to improve. But perhaps the most important lesson that manhunt taught me was the importance of resilience. In that game, there were moments when I felt like giving up, when I was out of breath and my legs felt like lead. But I knew that to win, I had to keep going, even when it felt like the odds were against me. This lesson has carried me through some of the most difficult moments of my life, whether it was the pressures of the college application process or the challenges of succeeding in college. There were times when I felt like giving up, when it seemed like the obstacles in my path were too great to overcome. But I knew that I had to keep pushing, to keep fighting, to stay resilient in the face of adversity. In my college essay, I tried to convey these lessons of competition, innovation, collaboration, and resilience, and to infuse my words with the same sense of passion and excitement that I felt during that game of manhunt so many years ago. And as I hit the 'submit' button, I felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had done my best, that I had poured my heart and soul into every word. It was not up to me to decide whether or not I would be accepted to schools like Yale or Harvard, but I knew that I had given it my all - just like I did in manhunt, just like I do in everything I pursue. The lessons of manhunt may seem small and trivial, but in reality, they have had a profound impact on my life. They have shaped the way I approach challenges, the way I collaborate with others, and the way I pursue my passions.

H,529,"When I broke the news to my volunteer team, we were in a church basement, cleaning up after the final event of the summer. I tried to downplay it. I nudged Ms. Diana, the neighborhood leader, in the shoulder, and said, 'Guess what I'll be doing next Wednesday — having lunch with the president.' Her face blazed with a kilowatt smile. Before I could slow her down, she shouted, 'Christopher's meeting President Obama next week.' Eldred dropped his broom, Ms. Sheila left the cups scattered on the floor, and all the others came running over and fusilladed me with questions. Yes, the campaign had chosen me from all the other summer organizers. Yes, I would bring photos for everyone. And yes, we had the strongest team by the numbers — total calls, knocks, voters registered, and events — in the country. I felt guilty that only I could go and told them so. 'I wish that I could bring you all with me. You made nearly all of the calls, brought your friends and family along, and made this what it is. I've just been here to facilitate.' The others good-naturedly shouted me down. Then Ms. Melva spoke up. Her words were pressed out against the heaving of her respirator. 'Christopher, don't feel bad. You'll bring us wherever you go in your pocket. Just pull us out when you meet Barack.' For a long time, I was perplexed by her advice. Then I thought back to the exercise that we employed before any volunteer activity. We sat in a circle and gave our reasons for being in the room, willing to work with the campaign. That way, when it came time to make our 'hard ask' on the phones, we would be supported by personal conviction and shared purpose. The 'hard ask' is the Obama campaign's tactic for garnering support or a commitment to volunteer, moving from values to idealism to specific action. In my work on the campaign, I am reminded of my cross-country coach, Rob. Before every single race, from petty league meets to national championships, Rob taps the spot on his thigh where a pocket would be. We look at our teammates who are lining up with us and tap the same spot. Coach Rob is reminding us, and we're reminding each other, that we carry 'the bastard' in our pockets with us throughout the race. 'The bastard in your pocket' is a metaphor for the sum of our efforts to succeed as runners. 'The bastard' exists as a sort of Platonic ideal form of the high school cross-country runner, melded from accrued mileage and mental conditioning. My goal in a race is to take this ideal form and to transform it into a reality that lives on the course. I want an education that fills my pockets. And, perhaps more importantly, an education that prompts hard asks, that demands us to use 'the bastard' and that uses the compounded experiences of a group for a single purpose.",1,2.161823747,2.473865359,2.814559276,3.224389071,2.63040305,7.4,11.8,18.2,23.0,14.0
C0,530,"The day I met Barack Obama was the day I realized the true impact of volunteering and education on society. It was a sunny day in August, and I had been given an opportunity to speak with the former president as part of a volunteer event. As I walked into the conference room, I was filled with excitement and nerves. This was an opportunity of a lifetime, and I wanted to make the most of it. Growing up, my parents instilled in me the importance of helping others. They believed that volunteering was not only a way to give back to the community, but also a way to learn about different perspectives and experiences. My first experience with volunteering was at a local food bank where I helped sort and distribute food to families in need. From that moment, I knew that volunteering was something I wanted to continue doing throughout my life. In high school, I became involved in various volunteer organizations, including a nonprofit that focused on providing education and healthcare to underserved communities. Through this organization, I learned about the struggles that people face in obtaining basic necessities that many of us take for granted. I was inspired by the resilience of these individuals and wanted to do more to help. This led me to organize a book drive for a local school that had limited resources. I reached out to friends, family, and classmates to donate books and other educational materials. The response was overwhelming, and we were able to donate over 500 books to the school. Seeing the smiles on the children's faces as they received their new books was a feeling I will never forget. This experience taught me the importance of education, and how it can serve as a gateway to a better life. In America, we often take for granted the access to education that we have. We forget that there are children in other countries who have to walk miles to attend school, or who may never have the chance to receive an education. Education is the foundation of society, and without it, we cannot progress. Meeting Barack Obama only solidified my belief in the importance of education and volunteering. He spoke about the impact that these two things can have on society, and the role that young people can play in making a difference. He emphasized the idea that one person can make a change, and that change starts with education and volunteering. One of the things that stood out to me was when he talked about the responsibility that we have as citizens to help those in need. He spoke about how we are all part of a larger community, and that it is our duty to help build that community up. His words resonated with me, and I realized that I had a responsibility to use my education and experiences to make a positive impact on society. I have continued to volunteer throughout college, and have taken courses that focus on social justice and inequality. I believe that education is not just about learning information, but also about understanding how we can use that information to make the world a better place. Through volunteering and education, I have learned about the struggles that people face, and have gained a greater appreciation for the privileges that I have been given. In conclusion, volunteering, education, and meeting Barack Obama have all had a profound impact on my life. They have taught me about the importance of helping others, the power of education, and the responsibility that we have as citizens to make a difference. As I move on to the next phase of my life, I will take these lessons with me and continue to make a positive impact on society.

C1,531,"Volunteering and education are underrated virtues that can have a transformative impact on individuals and society. As a high school senior, I discovered the value of volunteering, which led me to become part of a team that made a significant impact in our community. Meeting President Barack Obama only served to reinforce my belief in the transformative power of volunteering and education. My parents instilled in me the value of volunteering at a young age. As a result, I volunteered at a local food bank, which provided basic necessities to families in need. The experience taught me the importance of compassion and empathy. I wanted to do more, and so I joined an organization that focused on providing education and healthcare to underserved communities. I organized a book drive that donated over 500 books to a local school in need. Watching the children's faces light up as they received books gave me a sense of fulfillment and satisfaction I had never experienced before. Through these experiences, I learned that education is the foundation of society. Without education, we cannot progress. Education is a gateway to a better life, yet, we often take it for granted in America. Our schools are well-equipped, and the opportunity to learn is available to all, but this is not the case in many parts of the world. There are millions of children who don't have access to education, and that is unacceptable. We need to recognize the privilege we have and use it to help others. These values were reinforced when I met President Barack Obama. He emphasized the power of education and volunteering to enact change in society. He spoke about the impact that one person can make and how we have a responsibility as citizens to help build our community. His words resonated with me, and I was inspired to do more. I realized that my education and experiences could be used to create positive change in our world. Volunteering and education are intertwined, and I believe they are powerful tools that can make a significant impact on our society. We can use our education to help people, to make a positive impact in the world, and to bring hope to those who need it. Education doesn't end in the classroom; it's a lifelong process that empowers and transforms us. It connects us with others and allows us to become part of something greater than ourselves. As I move on to the next phase of my life, I will continue to volunteer and educate myself. I have realized that even the smallest contribution can make a significant impact. Whether it's donating books to a school, participating in a community event, or simply helping a neighbor. I will serve as a positive example and encourage others to do the same. In conclusion, volunteering and education are the cornerstones of a strong, vibrant, and empathetic community. The experiences I have had with volunteering and education have shaped me as an individual, providing me with a greater understanding of my values and the impact one person can make.

C2,532,"As I pushed the cart through the narrow aisles of the food bank, the scent of canned goods and boxed meals mingled in the air. The dull thud of my feet as they hit the concrete floor echoed in the silent room. Volunteers scurried about, their hurried footsteps creating a symphony of sound. I remember thinking to myself, this is where I belong. It wasn't just the act of volunteering that hooked me, but the sense of being part of something bigger than myself. It was about helping others, and in doing so, helping myself grow as an individual. When I joined the organization that provided education and healthcare to underserved communities, I felt a sense of purpose that fueled my drive to make a positive impact in my community. I remember walking into the dimly-lit library of the local school, where the walls were adorned with tattered and worn posters. The children sat cross-legged on the floor, their eyes bright and eager as they eagerly waited for me to distribute the books. As I handed each child a book, I felt the weight of the responsibility on my shoulders. I had to make sure that the books I had so painstakingly collected would make an impact in their lives. When I looked at them, I saw myself. A young person with the world at my feet, eager to soak up every piece of knowledge I could. I knew how much books could mean to a child, how it could ignite their imagination and inspire them to dream big. As I watched them flick through the pages of the books, I saw their eyes light up with wonder, and that was when I truly understood the value of education. Education is not just about learning facts and figures; it's about igniting the curiosity within us, encouraging us to ask questions and find answers. It's about opening up our minds to new possibilities, and providing us with the tools to create a brighter future. But the sad reality is that this privilege is not available to everyone, and that's why it's so important to give back to our communities. Growing up, I had always admired President Barack Obama, and when I was given the opportunity to meet him, I felt a sense of awe take over me. The minute he stepped into the room, I knew he was someone special. His aura was almost tangible, and his words had the power to move mountains. He spoke about the transformative power of education and volunteering, and I could sense the passion he had for those values. As I listened to him, I felt a sense of responsibility to carry on his legacy and make a difference. The experience of meeting President Obama only served to reinforce what I had always believed- that we are capable of being change agents in our own communities. We don't have to be world leaders or celebrities to make an impact- all it takes is the will to do good and a deep sense of empathy. Even the smallest of actions can have a ripple effect, and that's something that we shouldn't underestimate. As I get ready to leave high school, I know that I will take these values with me wherever I go. I have learned that education is a lifelong process that never truly ends, that volunteering is not just about giving back but also about learning from those we help. It's about bridging the gap between those who have and those who don't, and making sure that everyone has equal access to opportunities. In conclusion, the power of volunteering and education is immense, and it's a value that cannot be ignored in any society. Through volunteering and education, I have come to understand the importance of community, empathy and the transformative power of education. The experiences I have had have taught me that contributing to my community, no matter how small or significant, can make a significant impact. I am inspired by President Obama's words to be the change that I want to see in the world, and I will continue sharing this message with others. Education is the key to unlocking our potential, and volunteering is how we become agents of change. Together, we can build a brighter future for all.",0,2.63452928,2.826722449,2.924804892,3.191809417,2.889015436,16.6,20.0,21.4,25.4,21.0
H,533,"I’m a bit of a grandma. I don't wear horn rimmed spectacles, nor perch on a rocking chair, and I certainly wish I carried hard candies in my backpack. However, I do enjoy baking: butter sizzling as it glides across heated metal like a canoe across a glassy lake; powdered sugar fluttering through the air like glitter from a confetti cannon. Some consider themselves math, literature, or history nerds. I rifle through cookbooks, browse the internet for ingenious new recipes, and revel in this year’s birthday gift: a copy of “Bread Illustrated.” My greatest achievement in elementary school was not the perfect score on a spelling test, but the first time I mastered a batch of cookies that didn’t bear a rigidity comparable to steel. To my parents’ bewilderment, I dismissed Barbies, yo-yo’s, and jump ropes in favor of a wire whisk: It was love at first sight. Why do I bake? Sometimes it’s to thank a friend or reconnect with former colleagues, employers, and teachers. Just as often, it’s the intricate processes involved. Creating the exacting liaison between eggs and flour to create a pâte à choux is, for me, a form of meditation. And sometimes I bake to reflect and even gain insight into my other interests. Baking pastries for my next Junior Commission meeting, I ruminated on my interviews with officers and local homeless regarding their direct experiences with human trafficking in my own community. I recalled a police detective telling me, “For a youth isolated from family and friends, it doesn’t take much to accept the exploitation because he believes trafficking is his only chance of survival. I remember thinking, “Except that your body has to be sold like a box of cereal at Safeway?” This inspired my exhibit that was presented at high schools in my county, in which a figure, made up of barcodes, stands silhouetted against a black background. Then there was the time my political interests literally gave me food for thought. As a Senate page, I welcomed Senators and staff back from their Independence Day recess with choux à la crème, that perfect French amalgam of wheat, egg, butter and air we call cream puffs. I had cherry-picked the ingredients from a local farmer’s market, because local and organic is more than just a trend for me; it means contributing to the reduction of food miles and supporting small businesses rather than Big Agra. Ironically, activists that day chose to protest an aggressively lobbied pro-GMO bill by showering the Senate floor with dollar bills. Senators and staff brushed them off of their jackets while gingerly stepping around them to navigate the room. But the elephant in the room wasn’t the litter of currency, but the senators who paid more attention to corporate lobbyists than the protesters exposing their corruption. It deepened my perspective on how politics intersects our lives, farm to table. Yet, I’ve realized that when I feel empowered to advocate for a cause, I need to remember how the audience — legislators, for example — might view both my side and the opposing side. Sometimes they see us both as intruding groups. Other times, there are unseen advantages to acting in agreement with one side over the other or coming to a compromise. If, as M.F.K Fisher said, “First we eat, then we do everything else,” then baking is an avenue through which I have connected with people, causes and even intellectual pursuits. But the greatest gift that baking offers me is the responsibility to share. With this, I have realized an innate priority: to turn my talents, whether in the kitchen or an advocacy meeting, into tools to improve the welfare of others. My goal is to employ my compassion, intellect, and creativity into a career in public service. As much as I sometimes feel like a grandma, I also know a lot of grandmothers who happen to run our political system.",1,2.51230975,2.870202942,3.288935895,3.609770805,3.099290581,13.0,18.4,23.0,32.4,21.0
C0,534,"I was never much of a baker growing up. My attempts at whipping up chocolate chip cookies or banana bread often ended in disappointment. However, as I entered high school and became more involved in activism, baking took on a new importance in my life. Activism and baking seem like two completely different worlds. However, I believe that they intersect in powerful ways. For me, baking has become a form of peaceful protest and a way to spread messages of kindness and inclusivity. It all started the day after the 2016 presidential election. I was devastated by the results and unsure of how to move forward. In an effort to channel my emotions into something productive, I decided to bake. I made batches and batches of sugar cookies, each one decorated with a message of hope and love. I handed them out to my friends and family, as well as strangers on the street. And although it was a small gesture, it made me feel like I was doing something to make the world a little bit brighter. Since then, baking has become a form of activism for me. It allows me to create something tangible and share it with others. Baked goods have a way of breaking down barriers and bringing people together. When I bake for others, I am able to connect with them on a level that transcends politics or ideology. It is a reminder that we are all human and we all deserve to be treated with kindness and compassion. One of my most rewarding baking projects happened last summer. I volunteered with a local organization that supports refugees and immigrants. Many of the individuals they work with had never tried American desserts before, and I was asked to create a dessert workshop for them. I decided to make s'mores bars, a classic American treat that I loved as a kid. As I helped the participants assemble their bars and watched them enjoy the gooey, chocolatey goodness, I felt a sense of connection and joy. It was a small moment of happiness in what can be a very difficult and isolating experience for refugees and immigrants. Baking also allows me to bring attention to social justice issues. For example, one of my favorite recipes is a blueberry lemon cake that is made entirely with organic and fair-trade ingredients. When I bring this cake to events or bake sales, I am able to talk about the importance of supporting workers who are often marginalized and exploited in the food industry. It is a way to bring awareness to something that might otherwise go unnoticed. Another way that baking intersects with activism is through intersectionality. As a person of color, I am acutely aware of the ways that race, gender, class, and other identities intersect and interact. I try to bring this awareness into my baking as well. For example, I make it a point to source ingredients from local farmers and businesses, particularly those owned by women and people of color. I also make an effort to create baked goods that are inclusive of different dietary needs and restrictions, such as gluten-free or vegan options. It is important to me that my baking is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. In conclusion, activism and baking may seem like unlikely bedfellows, but I believe that they share a common thread: a commitment to creating something good and spreading joy in the world. As I move forward in my education and beyond, I hope to continue using baking as a tool for change and a way to connect with others. Whether it is through volunteering with a local organization or simply sharing cookies with my neighbors, I believe that baking can be a powerful tool for activism and social justice.",0,2.449223069,2.600105106,2.84031537,3.069399211,2.709556553,11.0,14.0,20.0,24.0,17.0
C1,535,"The aroma of freshly baked cookies has always provided me with a sense of comfort, and as I prepared to transition from high school to college, it became a vital part of my daily routine. Baking transformed from a simple pastime into a means of reflection, a way to cope with the anxieties and uncertainties of the future. As I followed a recipe, carefully measuring each ingredient and mixing them together, I found my mind wandering to my worries about college assignments and challenges, but as I began to focus on the physical act of baking, I slowly became grounded in the present moment. Baking became a form of meditation, allowing me to calm my mind and clear away any distractions. It was through baking that I developed a deeper appreciation for the satisfaction that comes from completing a task with care and attention to detail. Just as I couldn't rush through the mixing process, I began to approach my schoolwork and personal life with greater care and a more measured approach. Baking also taught me to embrace failure as an opportunity for growth, as there were many times when my creations did not turn out as planned. I learned that it is important to acknowledge my mistakes, learn from them and try again. Growing up in a multicultural family, I understood how food was an intrinsic part of cultural heritage, and throughout the years, family gatherings were always centered around homemade traditional dishes. Baking became a way for me to connect with my heritage and create memories, just as my family had done before me. My favorite recipe was handed down from my grandmother, who made a delicious chocolate cake that would leave you licking your fingers long after eating it. But baking wasn't just a way to remember my roots. It also became a way to connect with my community. In the early days of the pandemic, I baked batches of cookies and anonymously distributed them to my neighbors, who were struggling with the stress of social isolation. I used my love of baking to bring a small moment of joy and connection to others, which was so needed during that uncertain time. As I continued to bake for others, I also found myself baking for personal reflection, which allowed me to explore my thoughts and feelings in a safe and constructive manner. When I was feeling overwhelmed, I used baking as an outlet for my emotions, turning to the familiarity of the process to ground myself in the present. Through all of these experiences, one lesson was clear: baking has given me an outlet for creative expression. I loved experimenting with new recipes, working on perfecting the details, and ultimately sharing the results with others. This creativity has extended beyond my baking projects and into my academic interests. I enjoy taking creative approaches to assignments, sometimes using analogies or personal experiences to delve deeper into complex topics. Now, as I prepare to enter a new phase of life, I know that baking will always be an essential part of my routine, allowing me to reflect, connect and create. As I think back to that first batch of cookies and the countless times I've experimented and baked since then, I am grateful for the lessons it has taught me. These experiences have challenged me to be present, mindful, and creative, and for that, I will always cherish my love of baking.",0,2.774444313,2.972377255,3.150200778,3.238158074,3.059706891,17.6,22.2,26.0,30.0,25.0
C2,536,"The sound of my mother's prayers filled our house before the sun had even risen. A daily ritual that had become emblematic of my childhood. Her prayers were filled with hope and fear, and as I got older, I understood her worries better. I was now a senior in high school, and the pressures of college applications and exams weren't lost on me. Every day brought a new set of challenges, and I was constantly grappling with the anxieties of the future. It was during this time that I discovered my love for running. I had never been athletic before, but something about the rhythmic pattern of my feet hitting the pavement, the sound of my breaths in sync with my steps, calmed my mind. While running, my mind was free to wander and I often ruminated on the endless possibilities of the future. It became a way for me to push myself physically and mentally, creating a powerful synergy that strengthened me. Running also allowed me to connect with the world around me in a visceral way. I was more attuned to the sensory details of my environment. The cool air on my skin, the smell of freshly mowed grass, the sound of leaves rustling in the wind. It was as if my senses were heightened, and I was alive in the moment, savoring every sensation. Running became a way for me to explore my mind and my surroundings, creating a deeper awareness of the world around me. Just as I navigated the physical terrain of my runs, I found myself navigating the emotional terrain of my life. Running provided a way for me to process my feelings, to push through pain and difficulty. There were days when I didn't feel like running, when the idea of facing the challenges of the day seemed too daunting. But those were the days when running was the most important. It taught me that to overcome difficulties, I needed to lean into them and face them head-on. Through running, I discovered a newfound resilience within myself. I had always been a resilient person, but something about the act of pushing through physical discomfort taught me that true resilience is forged in the moments when we feel we have nothing left to give. I learned that pushing through pain – both physically and emotionally – creates an inner strength and resilience that I could draw on in difficult moments. Running became a way for me to create a deeper connection to my community. I joined a running club, where I met a diverse group of people who shared my love of running. It was through our runs – where we cheered each other on, and pushed each other further than we thought possible – that I discovered the power of community. We were all working towards a common goal, and in doing so, we lifted each other up. As I prepare to graduate high school, my running practice remains an essential part of my routine. I know that the road ahead of me will be filled with more challenges and obstacles, but I am confident that my running practice has prepared me to face them head-on. I have learned that the only way to overcome difficulties is to lean into them, to embrace the discomfort and use it as a tool for growth. Looking back, it's clear to me that running has been more than a physical practice – it has been a way of life. It has taught me to push myself beyond my limits, to savor the present moment, and to connect with my community in a meaningful way. It has given me a strength that I can draw on in difficult moments, and created a foundation of resilience that will serve me well in college and beyond. Ultimately, running has become more than just a hobby – it has become an integral part of who I am.",0,2.610631323,2.743136432,2.884093492,3.026384615,2.785928604,15.0,18.0,20.0,25.6,19.0
H,537,"I am African-American, Caucasian, Jewish, and gay, and narrowly escaping the degradation of my ancestors: my great-great-great grandfather's slavery, my grandmother's persecution in the Holocaust, and the denial of gay identity. I am the personification of the culture and struggles of each of these groups. As I walk through life with this mix, I must be able to respect and love all different walks of life. Furthermore, during those times that I stereotype people, I assume roles onto their identity. I am able to stop myself and realize that they hold the wisdom from experiences that I do not, and that I am actually hurting myself. Judging a book by its cover really does make you miss out. Some people I know acknowledge me as the gay guy, a member of that small minority that is stricken with bullying and identity crisis, seldom as a Jew or black. It has always been important to me for people to recognize me by my radiant personality and not by my superficial sexuality or race. My ethnicity and orientation do not define me: they are the tools my ancestors have granted so that I can pursue my destiny, and I have my individual spirit to color my path. I am an independent, positive person. I carry the mark of maturity with the essence of vitality. I can only hope that people remember me via my relationships with them and my effects on their lives. And so I apply the same mindset to others. The snappy, aggravated cashier at the grocery store checking me out may be working through her retirement to pay for her granddaughter's tuition. Or the black youth with his jeans hanging low and 'speaking Ebonics' is actually executing a facet of his culture from which he takes pride and grows. Moreover my template also allows me to be open-minded; how could I not be cultural? My ancestors would not have succeeded without those that have listened and empathized with their plights. And how could I shut my ears? I cannot; I will not. I will not allow myself to shut out another's opinion simply because I was not introduced to their beliefs in my upbringing. How ignorant and arrogant to speak my gospel and thrive on the grace of others but not even consider others' words? Every breath I take is due to the grace of those magnanimous humans before me who not only listened to those Jews, or those slaves, or that gay person, but also took it upon themselves to advance humanity beyond close-mindedness into a world where every individual's contribution based on their experience is respected. There is never a time to neglect the social fragility of our existence, not in the courtroom or the living room. To assume the serenity of social culture is a blind eye to the macrocosm of daily life. It is my expectation to persevere for the fight for human rights and to respect the nature of all cultures and all peoples through my actions as well as my words. It is insufficient to tell someone they are wrong for persecuting. We have to help them find no solace in their prejudice. Not only do I have a duty to argue for the progress of our humanity, I will do so by example.",1,2.358383998,2.605876108,2.880253837,3.331405761,2.661915854,11.0,15.8,21.0,26.6,20.0
C0,538,"As a child of immigrant parents, I have often pondered the complexities of diversity and personal identity. Growing up in an ethnically diverse neighborhood, I was exposed to a range of cultures and customs, but I struggled to fully understand what it meant to be a person of color in America. It wasn't until I entered high school that I began to truly embrace my cultural roots and explore the intricacies of my identity. Through my involvement in various cultural clubs and organizations, I began to appreciate the beauty and richness of the diverse experiences that make up our society. However, I soon realized that embracing diversity and personal identity is not always easy. Our society is plagued by institutionalized racism, discrimination, and intolerance, which often hinder individuals from fully embracing their cultural heritage and identity. In the face of these challenges, it is crucial that we continue to fight for equity and justice for all. For me, diversity and personal identity are not just pieces of my identity, but they are the very fabric of who I am as a person. I have come to appreciate the value and strength that come with a diverse and multicultural community. Diversity has taught me empathy, resilience, and open-mindedness, traits that have helped me navigate the challenges of adolescence and become the person I am today. My experiences growing up as a child of immigrant parents have also given me a unique perspective on what it means to be an American. I have come to see America as a melting pot of cultures, a place where people from all walks of life come together to create something beautiful and unique. To me, personal identity is a dynamic and ever-evolving concept that encompasses various aspects of one's life. It is the combination of our experiences, values, beliefs, and culture that make us who we are. Personal identity is not static but rather something that constantly evolves as we navigate the world around us. As a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I have come to appreciate the importance of embracing one's personal identity. For many, it can be challenging to embrace themselves fully, especially in the face of intolerance and discrimination. However, I believe that it is essential to be true to oneself, to stand tall in the face of adversity, and to live life on one's terms. In my time at high school and beyond, I have made a conscious effort to immerse myself in various cultures and experiences. This has allowed me to appreciate the beauty of diversity and to become more open-minded and empathetic towards others. Through my involvement in cultural clubs, community service, and other extracurricular activities, I have come to see the world through a more nuanced lens and appreciate the diversity that makes our society so unique. I also believe that it is crucial for us to challenge ourselves to go beyond our comfort zones and embrace diversity in all its forms. This could mean stepping outside of our social circles, learning about different cultures, or even traveling to new places. By doing so, we can break down the barriers that divide us and strive towards a more inclusive and equitable society. As I prepare to embark on the next stage of my life, I am excited to continue exploring the complexities of diversity and personal identity. I plan to pursue a degree in social work, where I hope to work towards creating a more just and equitable society for all. I am inspired by the resilience and strength of those who have fought for social justice, and I hope to one day contribute to this legacy. Ultimately, for me, diversity and personal identity are not just buzzwords or catchphrases, but they are fundamental aspects of our society and our individual selves. It is through embracing these complexities and challenging ourselves to be more inclusive that we can foster a more equitable and just world.",0,2.796006622,2.94082275,3.009669345,3.266143768,2.977906771,18.0,21.2,24.8,26.0,23.0

I am inspired by my upbringing and the diverse individuals I have encountered in my life to walk towards a world where diversity is celebrated, and differences are respected. As a high school senior with dreams of attending prestigious universities like Yale or Harvard, I am committed to becoming an advocate of diversity and inclusion. My life has been shaped by experiences stemming from diversity in various ways. I have faced challenges due to my race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and cultural background, but those challenges have inspired me to pursue a world where such challenges are non-existent. While growing up, I had the opportunity of attending youth conferences, volunteering in community centers, and attending summer camps, all of which immersed me in cultures and allowed me to interact with individuals of various backgrounds. These experiences helped me understand that our differences are meant to be appreciated and celebrated. Diversity is a source of strength and inspiration, and we must learn to celebrate and respect it. I believe that it starts with genuinely listening to others with an open heart, coupled with a willingness to understand their unique experiences and challenges. We must be willing to learn from others, eager to embrace new ideas, opinions and ways of life different from ours. Learning from others and being empathetic, even towards people with different belief systems, can and will lead to positive interactions and meaningful friendships. As a society, we need to create an environment that embraces diversity, promotes mutual trust and understanding, and opposes prejudices, racism, bigotry, and xenophobia. This environment will foster the creation of safe spaces for those who feel excluded based on their racial or ethnic backgrounds or sexual preferences. It will encourage individuals to be their full selves, free from microaggressions and discriminations. To create this environment, we all have a role to play. We must work together to promote a culture of curiosity, inquisitiveness, and empathy that accommodates for different backgrounds, opinions and experiences. We can also establish open communication channels that will enable individuals to share their values, beliefs, and experiences without fear of discrimination or bias. As a high school senior, I am committed to promoting inclusion as a vital value for all. I believe in cultivating an environment that is diverse, inclusive, and empathetic towards the unique experiences, beliefs, and lifestyles around us. In this way, we can create a culture that respects and celebrates diversity as a source of individual strength, sparking a movement that seeks to create a world where everyone is welcomed and appreciated. In conclusion, our differences are what make us unique as individuals. These differences should be celebrated and respected, not subjected to scorn or disdain. Cultivating an environment that embraces diversity will help float the ideals of mutual respect, understanding, and inclusion, which is key to creating a world where everyone is welcomed and appreciated.

C2,540,"The sun broke through the clouds, casting long shadows on the pavement as I made my way through the bustling streets of Harlem. As I walked, the sounds of jazz music from street performers filled the air with its soulful rhythm, adding to the rich cultural tapestry that makes this community unique. It was here, in Harlem, that I developed a profound appreciation for diversity. Growing up in a multicultural family, I learned early on the importance of embracing and respecting differences. But it was in Harlem where I saw firsthand the potency of diversity. I spent my youth attending a variety of youth conferences, where I explored various cultures and interacted with people from different backgrounds. These experiences taught me that beauty can thrive even in diversity. One summer, I attended a camp for kids across New York City. The camp introduced me to Gabriel, a young boy who had lived in a homeless shelter with his mother. Gabriel was one of the happiest kids I had met, despite his living conditions. He shared with us his passion for art, and how it kept him motivated to stay positive. To see the resilience and determination within him in the face of adversity had a lasting impact on me. Despite the challenges he faced, Gabriel never lost hope. He taught me that passion, coupled with an optimistic mindset, can overcome even the toughest situations. Throughout my life, I have carried Gabriel's story as a symbol of the resilience and strength that lies within diversity. But moving to the suburbs was a culture shock for me. It lacked the same vibrancy as Harlem, with its many food trucks, street performers, and murals that represented different cultures. I missed the poetic rhythm of those streets, the diversity that colors the experience of walking down those avenues, and the passion that residents possessed when they spoke of their communities. But despite the cultural differences, the strength of the human spirit holds firm. Once, while volunteering with an immigrant outreach program in the suburbs, I met a young girl named Maria. She had come to America with her parents, fleeing from the violence in her home country. Maria struggled to communicate her needs, frustrated by her limited English vocabulary. I decided to help her by teaching her phrases that were commonly used at school. Every week, Maria would come in with a big smile, excited to show me how much she had learned. She would share personal stories with me, and I was humbled by her willingness to trust me with them. I remember feeling that teaching her English was more than just improving language proficiency – it was also about fostering self-worth and belonging, and that's what diversity truly is. Growing up, my environment was a personal lesson in how diversity enriches our lives. I learned that diversity is more than just a fact of life – it is a celebration of the unique differences that make humanity strong. It is about creating a space where people are heard and seen, despite their upbringing or experiences. As I prepare to attend Yale or Harvard, I look forward to sharing my experiences with people from different backgrounds. I am excited to create a space of mutual trust and understanding, where people can share their unique perspectives, celebrate differences, and ultimately build a stronger community. I hope to tap into their stories, embrace the diversity around me, and create a sense of belonging for everyone, regardless of their experiences. In conclusion, our diverse backgrounds have a lot to offer, and learning from each other and celebrating our unique differences will only serve to create a more accepting, tolerant, and empathetic society. I will bring this passion to college and beyond, committed to advocating for inclusion and diversity.

H,541,"My father said I didn’t cry when I was born. Instead, I popped out of the womb with a furrowed brow, looking up at him almost accusatorially, as if to say “Who are you? What am I doing here?” While I can’t speak to the biological accuracy of his story — How did I survive, then? How did I bring air into my lungs? — it’s certainly true that I feel like I came preprogrammed with the compulsion to ask questions. I received my first journal in preschool, probably because my parents were sick of cleaning my crayon drawings off my bedroom wall. Growing up, my notebooks became the places where I explored ideas through actions in addition to words. If the face I was sketching looked broody, I began to wonder what in her life made her that way. Was she a spy? Did she just come in from the cold? Graduating from crayons to markers to colored pencils, I layered color upon color, testing out the effects of different combinations, wondering why the layering of notes in music filled me with the very same happiness as the sight of the explosion of paired colors beneath my hands. I began to take notes, on anything and everything. Reading Steve Martin’s Born Standing Up, I took away lessons on presentations, of maintaining a rhythm and allowing crescendos of energy to release every so often. While watching a documentary on people preparing for a sommelier exam, I made note of the importance of an enriching environment where most everything points you to your goals. Flipping through my old journal, I see that even an article about trouble in the South China Sea inspired notes on precedent and maintaining tradition lest you provoke the unknown. I was looking for the rules of the world. More than just a place to catalogue my observations about the world, my notebooks are places to synthesize, to course-correct, to pinpoint areas for iterative improvement. When the words are down on paper, I see my patterns of thought and the holes in my logic stark against the white page. If I have a day of insecurity that leads to a sudden rush of journaling characteristic of that in a teen movie, looking down at the angsty scribbles, I'll recognize my repeated thoughts and actions and look for pressure points in that system of behavior where I can improve. Now my 2016 notebook returns to exploring the world through actions and experiments. Dozens of doughnut-shaped sketches dot pages that ask “how would you play tic-tac-toe on a torus?” Another page containing bubble letters answers the simpler question of the result of sorting these figures into groups of topological equivalences. Not two pages later are the results of a research binge on Mersenne primes that took me through perfect numbers and somehow deposited me at a Wikipedia page detailing the mathematical properties of the number 127. Once again, I look for the rules of the world. Whenever I feel discouraged, I look to my stack of notebooks, shelved neatly by my desk. In those pages I’ve learned that I have room to fail and grow, to literally turn over a new leaf if a problem is particularly tricky. Through years of scribbling away, I’ve learned that the most fundamental part of my development has been giving myself the space to try: to sketch mangled faces, to draw the wrong conclusions, to answer a question incorrectly, and to learn from my mistakes without shame. I look to that mass of notebooks filled with my ideas, my mistakes, and my questions, and I'm reminded that I’ve grown before, and that I’ll grow again, all the while asking questions.",1,2.433285357,2.89701041,3.278803664,3.66583334,3.017680342,10.0,18.2,25.2,32.4,22.0
C0,542,"Growing up, I often found myself daydreaming instead of paying attention in class. I was an imaginative child, constantly lost in my own thoughts. But as I grew older, I discovered a tool that helped me focus and reflect on my thoughts: journaling. At first, my journal entries were simply a stream of consciousness - a way to release the thoughts swirling in my head. But as I continued to write, I realized that journaling was more than just a therapeutic outlet; it was a powerful tool for lifelong learning. Through journaling, I developed the habit of introspection - the act of examining my thoughts and feelings. This is a crucial skill for personal growth and success in any field. In fact, many successful entrepreneurs and leaders credit their success to self-reflection and introspection. Journaling allowed me to reflect on my past experiences and learn from my mistakes. I began to analyze my behavior and thought patterns, and identify areas for improvement. This introspection not only helped me grow as a person, but also provided valuable insights that I could apply in academic and professional settings. For example, I used to struggle with time-management and procrastination. I would leave assignments until the last minute and then rush to complete them, often leading to mediocre grades. Through journaling, I was able to identify the root causes of my procrastination and develop strategies to overcome it. I started breaking down my tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks, and creating a schedule to hold myself accountable. These strategies not only helped me improve my grades, but also taught me valuable lessons about discipline and perseverance. Journaling also helped me develop my writing skills. The act of putting my thoughts onto paper forced me to clarify and articulate my ideas. I learned how to express myself effectively, whether it was in a college essay, a job application, or even a simple email. The more I wrote, the more I discovered my own voice and style. This creativity and clarity translated to my academic writing, as well, and I began to receive higher grades on writing assignments. In addition, journaling allowed me to document my personal growth over time. Looking back at my old journal entries, I can see how much I've changed and evolved as a person. I can see the challenges I've overcome and the lessons I've learned along the way. This sense of progress and accomplishment is a powerful motivator, and it reminds me that no matter what obstacles I may face in the future, I have the resilience and perseverance to overcome them. Journaling is also a tool for empathy and understanding. When I write about my experiences, I am forced to see them from different perspectives. I can see how my actions and words affect others, and I can develop a deeper sense of compassion for people who may be going through similar struggles. For example, in my junior year of high school, I had a falling out with a close friend. At the time, I was focused on my own feelings of anger and hurt, and I couldn't see her perspective at all. But after reflecting on the situation in my journal, I began to see how my own behavior had contributed to the conflict, and I was able to reach out to her and apologize. This act of empathy and introspection not only repaired our friendship, but also taught me an invaluable lesson about communication and conflict resolution. In conclusion, journaling is a lifelong learning tool that has benefited me in countless ways. It has helped me develop introspection, writing skills, personal growth, empathy, and understanding. As I prepare to enter college and the workforce, I know that these skills will be essential for my success. Therefore, I plan to continue journaling and using it as a tool for lifelong learning and personal growth.",0,2.639749993,2.740659168,2.887919107,3.029683189,2.85354515,13.0,15.0,19.0,22.0,18.0
C1,543,"Growing up, I was always driven by the desire to learn and explore. My insatiable curiosity was evident from the very beginning of my life, as I came into this world with a furrowed brow, as if questioning everything around me. Despite my father’s story, my compulsion to ask questions has remained with me throughout my life. I have used my questions to create a space for inquiry, reflection, and growth by keeping a notebook. As I reflect on my notebook, I see it not only as a tool for my success but also as a representation of my growth and achievement. My notebook has been my trusted companion and academic coach, helping me to stay organized and disciplined. It has allowed me to take better notes, stay on top of my assignments and be prepared for exams. It has been a tangible representation of my academic journey, a sanctuary where I could reflect on my academic growth. Thanks to my notebook, I have been able to develop my own identity as a learner. It has brought me a sense of ownership and responsibility for my academic journey, and I have felt empowered to take on new challenges and push myself outside of my comfort zone. Reflecting on my notebook, one of my proudest moments was during my junior year. Despite countless hours of studying for my AP Biology exam, I still felt anxious as the exam day approached. However, as I pored over my notes and reviewed my diagrams the night before, I felt a sense of calm wash over me. I knew that I was prepared, and I was ready to do my best. With my notebook tucked under my arm, I walked into the exam room filled with confidence and assurance. As I read through the questions, I saw the answers jump off the pages of my notebook. Thanks to my notebook, I was able to perform exceptionally well on the exam, and I felt a sense of accomplishment and pride. Looking forward to my college journey, I know that my notebook will continue to be an invaluable tool for my academic success. It is not just an academic exercise, but a personal one, helping me to develop the belief that I can achieve anything if I work hard and believe in myself. My notebook will be a reminder of where I have been and the guideposts for where I am going. In addition to academic success, my notebook has also helped me to develop a sense of self-awareness. It has been a place where I could synthesize my thoughts, pinpoint areas for iterative improvement and learn from my mistakes without shame. It has allowed me to see my patterns of thought and holes in my logic stark against the white page. My notebooks have been the places where I explore ideas through actions in addition to words. As a child, I tested out color combinations, exploring the effects of different combinations. As I grew older, I took notes on anything and everything, absorbing knowledge from books, movies, and documentaries. From a Steve Martin biography, I learned about presentations and how to maintain a rhythm for maximum impact. From a documentary on sommeliers, I took note of the importance of an enriching environment to achieve goals. Even an article about trouble in the South China Sea inspired notes on precedent and tradition. Now, in college, I see my notebook as a tool for exploring the world through actions and experimentation. I sketch diagrams that test theories, and I explore complex mathematical concepts through drawings and notes. My notebook is a place to ask questions, pushing my curiosity out into the world and seeking answers. Through my notebook, I have learned that I have room to fail and grow, to literally turn over a new leaf if a problem is particularly tricky. My notebook has been a constant reminder that I have grown before, and I will grow again, all the while asking questions. As I look to the future, I see my notebook as a window into my personal growth, a symbol of my academic journey, and a reminder of everything I have achieved. It has been a tool for inquiry, reflection, and growth, and I know that it will continue to be an invaluable asset as I continue to push myself to achieve greatness.",0,2.794425963,2.979530724,3.090631101,3.159000666,3.047998682,16.0,18.0,19.0,23.0,18.0
C2,544,"I am not sure if a notebook can get one into Harvard, but the possibilities are limitless, and my green moleskin has been my constant companion over the last decade. It has transitioned with me through countless stages in life and has always been synonymous with growth, both academically and personally. If I had a class with you, and we were scheduled to work on lab reports, I would sit with that trusty notebook in front of me, a barometer of what we were learning, what would soon be revised, and what concepts still remained nebulous. The green cover of my notebook is frayed, and the edges have long since worn, but the fifty-eight pages inside are an ode to my learning. The first half of the notebook was all notes from my junior year of high school. Biology, Spanish, English, and every other course in between, the notes on the periwinkle pages spanned the range of subjects from the microscopic to Kafka, intertwined with personal assessments of the day's lessons ranging from impassive observations to strong affirmations of the teacher's ability. The rest of the notebook was markers of my growth throughout my senior year, fuelled by my discipline, love for learning, and the possibility of a future beyond the walls of high school. Just like my junior year, my notes spanned the range of courses, but this time was a little different. My English notes, for example, revealed the development of my growth as both a reader and writer. Starting with assigned readings, the entries began almost formulaic. I would describe the author's tone, voice and pick out literary devices before delving into an analysis in the context of the assignment. However, as we moved from assignment to assignment, the contents of the notebook varied drastically. The notes became introspective and personal, rooted in my experiences and feelings. One particular set of notes from my senior English class stands out to me. We had been assigned an essay in response to Sylvia Plath's novel, The Bell Jar. The book is a semi-autobiographical novel about a young woman, Esther Greenwood, struggling with depression in 1950s America. As I read my copy of the novel through my tears, I empathized with Esther, feeling my own experiences with depression reflected in the classics' pages. I used my notebook as a tool to chart my feelings and reflections, taking note of phrases and symbols that reflected both Esther's experiences and mirrored my own. For example, Esther describes feeling 'as if the world would go on forever and I would be stuck in one spot for eternity' (19). Considering the bleak and hopeless world presented in the novel, to feel trapped in this way was the most terrifying and almost painful emotions I could ever comprehend. Beneath the quote, I scribbled a personal reflection asking myself, 'Is this how you feel?' and then noting a quick, 'yes.' My notebook became more than just a place for facts and figures: it became where I explored my emotions and intellectualized my experiences. Now, in college, my usage of my green notebook is different. It has become both a medium and a message, a blend of personal development and academic achievement. On it, I chart out study plans, cram equations, and review definitions but also journal personal experiences, draw plants and animals from class, and even includes an additional space to do my math homework. It is a tool to explore, discover and try new things. Along its pages lies not only academic pursuits, but also deeply personal sentiments that provides me with insight into the intricacies of my mind. As I began my freshman year, I had doubts about my major, a sense of imposter syndrome, and severe homesickness. This time, my notebook was both personal and transactional; the pages were a canvas where I could externalize my internal turmoil so I could look at it through fresh eyes. I wrote how I felt and turned that feeling into a tangible to-do list. On the days when the imposter syndrome turned into dread, I channeled my energy by sketching my dorm room, making note of the objects and personalities therein, feeling grateful that my new beginning was different from the past. Keeping a notebook has been a reminder of my growth and academic journey, and as I look towards the future, I know it will continue to be an invaluable tool. It has given me the confidence and the discipline I need to achieve big things, and I am forever indebted to it. However, no matter where I go from here, the notebook will always be with me, a symbol of my perseverance, resilience and possibility.",0,2.731859821,3.00536166,3.254767307,3.51504857,3.177700427,14.8,18.6,23.4,30.0,22.0
H,545,"I stood frozen in the produce aisle at ShopRite, wondering which of the five varieties of oranges to buy. Valencia, blood orange, organic, Florida navel – what were the differences? When I asked my mom which variety she was looking for, she responded curtly, “It’s your choice. Pick what you want.” The thing was, I didn’t know what I wanted. For my parents, this level of freedom – even in the orange section of the grocery store — is somewhat unique to the United States. The lingering policies of the Cultural Revolution in 1970s China dictated life choices for my parents; growing up in poverty, their families’ sole concern was putting food on the table. As a result of economic disadvantage, higher education became my parents’ life goal. “If I didn’t make it to college,” my dad told me, “I would have been trapped in that godforsaken village for the rest of my life” (only one-tenth of his high school ever made it). My parents didn’t have a choice: my mom’s entire life revolved around studying, and my dad was spanked into shape at home. Sports, music, or entertainment were out of the question – my parents’ only option was to work hard and dream of a choice in America. The miraculous thing is that my parents, having no freedom of choice for the better part of twenty years, still had the vision to grant me choice in the United States. Unfortunately, this is not common, even in our beloved land of opportunity. All I have to do is talk to my closest childhood friends - children of other Asian-American immigrants – to see the glass walls that cultural and familial expectation have erected around their lives. For some of them, playing the piano is an obligation, not a hobby, and medical school is the only career option. Oddly enough, I had always felt a bit left out when I was younger – why weren’t my parents signing me up for American Math Competitions and middle school summer research programs, when all my friends were doing them? I’ve come to realize, though, that having the choice to do the things I’m interested in brings out an enthusiasm I can explore passionately and fully. My many hobbies – playing soccer with our neighbor in my backyard, fiddling around with Mendelssohn on my violin, or even talking to my friend about our latest stock picks – all have come from me, and I’m forever grateful to my parents for that. The contrast between my parents’ lives and mine is shocking. In the United States, I have so many paths available to me that I sometimes can’t even choose. I don’t even know what kind of oranges to buy, yet oranges – or any other fruit - were precious delicacies to my dad as a child. I can dream of attending a school like Harvard and studying whatever I want, whether it be math, economics, or even philosophy or biochemistry – a non-existent choice for my parents, who were assigned majors by their universities. I can even dream of becoming an entrepreneur, which I see as exploration and self-destiny in its purest form. I can be sure that wherever my true passions take me, my parents will support the choices that I make, as they have for seventeen years. Most importantly, though, I value that Harvard, with its centuries-long devotion to educating the full person, fosters the same sense of choice for its students that I have come to so deeply appreciate in my parents. I am exhilarated to have the freedom to define my own academic journey and, looking forward, for this upcoming four-year odyssey to lay the groundwork for a lifetime of exploration. For me, thankfully, it’s all possible - but only because of the sacrifice and vision of my parents.",1,2.76224771,3.070902714,3.329226474,3.735669126,3.193518775,17.0,21.0,26.0,34.0,25.0
C0,546,"The United States of America has always been known for its freedoms - the freedom of speech, the freedom of press, and the freedom of choice. The freedom of choice has been an especially important idea in my life, and one that I am immensely grateful for. As a high school senior, I have been given the opportunity to make countless decisions about my life and my future. These choices have shaped my identity and allowed me to become the person I am today. However, I have come to realize that not all people in America have access to the same freedoms of choice, and this realization has made me passionate about advocating for change. Growing up, I was fortunate to have parents who allowed me to make decisions for myself. They encouraged me to try new things and explore different interests, while always reminding me that the ultimate decision was mine to make. At times, this freedom of choice led me astray, such as my initial decision to pursue a career in medicine just because it was considered a prestigious profession. It took me a while to realize that I'm actually more interested in public policy, advocacy, and social entrepreneurship than I am in medicine. But it was this freedom to choose my own path that ultimately led me to my true calling. My experience, however, is not the same for everyone. Many Americans do not have the same level of access to freedom of choice as I do, due to factors such as economic status, race, or gender. For example, lower-income families may not have the financial resources to provide their children with extracurricular activities or educational opportunities that could open up new avenues for choice. Similarly, people of color and women face systemic obstacles that limit their access to certain academic and professional paths. This inequality in the availability of choice has inspired me to take action, to use my own freedom of choice to create a world where everyone can experience the same freedom that I have. In my community, I have started volunteering with organizations that provide low-income families with financial assistance to engage in extracurricular activities. By working with these families, I have seen firsthand how access to choice can change someone's life. One of the most rewarding moments was when I helped a student at a local middle school obtain a scholarship that allowed him to join his school's robotics team. Prior to this, he had never heard of robotics and didn't think engineering was particularly interesting. But after attending the science fair and seeing what the robotics team had accomplished, he was hooked. As I sat beside him, watching him program his robot and listening to him talk about his dream of becoming a robotics engineer, I realized the power of choice. It was my privilege to help provide him with a chance to explore new passions, and in turn he was creating his own future through his newfound freedom of choice. It is important to recognize that freedom of choice is not just about individual success. Rather, it is about creating a more equitable society where everyone has the chance to thrive. By limiting the availability of choice, we limit the potential of individuals and the entire country. For this reason, it is important for all of us to advocate for policies that promote and protect freedom of choice for all, regardless of socioeconomic status, race, or gender. As a future leader, I am committed to fighting for this fundamental right that defines us as Americans. To those who oppose the freedom of choice, I understand your concerns. It can be tempting to want to limit the options of others, especially if we believe that some choices are better than others. However, it is important to remember that true freedom of choice means that sometimes people make choices that we may not agree with, but that is the price we pay for the value of individual liberty. My own parents, for instance, were skeptical when I told them that I was no longer interested in pursuing a career in medicine, but they ultimately supported me because they believed in my right to choose. Encouraging people to make choices that align with our beliefs at the expense of their own agency is not security or safety, it is just another form of oppression. Freedom of choice may seem simple, but it is the cornerstone of democracy and personal liberty. It is what makes America unique and what has enabled the country to achieve great progress over time. As a high school senior, I hope to use my own freedom of choice to create change, and to advocate for policies that advance the freedom of choice for all. I believe that this is the only way to create a just and equitable society where everyone has the ability to pursue their passions, whatever they may be.",0,2.654497241,2.865323558,3.102808713,3.393557095,3.015592635,16.0,19.0,26.0,29.0,22.0
C1,547,"The 'freedom of choice' is a popular term that is often associated with America's ethos. However, as a high school senior, I have learned that this concept is far from simple. While I have been fortunate to experience the many ways in which freedom of choice can be beneficial, I have also realized that it is a more nuanced issue than one might initially think. Through my life experiences, I have learned that the freedom of choice in America is intertwined with privilege, consequence, responsibility, and empathy – all of which play a significant role in shaping one's journey towards success. One of the most challenging aspects of freedom of choice is the societal pressure to conform to specific expectations of success. From a young age, I learned that academic success was highly valued in American society. Consequently, like many other students, I felt obligated to pursue prestigious universities and high-paying professions such as law or medicine. However, I realized that this notion is problematic as it suggests that these professions are the only means of living a fulfilling life. It was only through self-reflection and exploration that I realized my passion for entrepreneurship, an option I was not aware of before. I discovered that pursuing one's dreams rather than social expectations can lead to greater happiness and self-fulfillment. Moreover, the freedom of choice is intertwined with societal privilege. Growing up, I witnessed how access to resources varied significantly based on the socio-economic status of an individual. This limited the opportunities available to students from low-income households, and was a significant disadvantage compared to their wealthier peers. Students from wealthy backgrounds had access to better resources, resulting in a more well-rounded education, whereas students from poorer backgrounds had to continually navigate financial limitations. However, using one's financial privilege to uplift others is an essential step towards combatting socio-economic disparities. In addition, the choices we make affect not only ourselves, but also those around us. This is where the concept of empathy becomes critical. Having empathy means enacting policies that support the underprivileged and recognizing how one's choices impact those who may be more vulnerable than yourself. During the Covid-19 pandemic, how one chose to act directly impacted the lives of others. By being mindful of the consequences of our choices, we can make a positive impact on society. Recognizing these factors is key to understanding that freedom of choice comes with a great responsibility. We are responsible for using our freedom of choice with respect to values differing from ours and with knowledge of the impact of our actions on society. To ensure that we make choices that reflect our values, we must stay informed about issues related to social justice, climate change, and access to education. We can then advocate for equitable solutions that benefit everyone, even those who have not always had access to the same freedoms as we have. In conclusion, freedom of choice is a complex, multi-faceted issue. Throughout my experiences, I have learned that acknowledging the nuances of the concept is the first step towards utilizing it effectively. There is no single path to achieving success or satisfaction in life, but by recognizing the barriers that limit some from exercising their freedom of choice, we can work towards creating a society where the opportunities and resources are available to all. As an aspiring college student, I understand that the power of my choices extends beyond myself and that it is my responsibility to make my choices informed and just. By adopting this mindset and a sense of empathy, I can play my part in creating a more equitable society, leveraging America's freedom of choice towards positive change.",0,2.614563539,2.937315745,3.15311702,3.265889101,3.039041219,15.0,17.2,21.8,26.4,20.0
C2,548,"The whirring sound of the school bell marked the start of my first day of high school. As I walked towards my classroom, I could smell the musty books and disinfectant that filled the air. As a first-generation American, I was excited about exercising my freedom of choice at this new stage of my life. However, I quickly realized that achieving academic success is not as simple as checking off boxes on a to-do list. In America, academic success is highly valued. High-paying careers such as law and medicine are often viewed as the most prestigious and lucrative paths to a fulfilling life. However, the pressure to pursue these paths can be crippling. I was constantly reminded of the “American Dream” which claimed that by working hard, I could achieve anything. This mantra ignored the various societal realities that limit access to resources and the obstacles that low-income students face. It wasn’t until my sophomore year that I discovered my passion for entrepreneurship. My school had partnered with a local non-profit organization that focused on creating entrepreneurial programs for students in under-resourced communities. I took the chance and joined one of the programs. With their guidance and support, I created a business plan for a mobile application that tackled a problem in my community. I realized that pursuing entrepreneurship was a viable alternative to achieving success on my own terms. I recognize that it was my privilege that allowed me to participate in an entrepreneurial program. Not all schools offer such programs, and not all students have access to financial and educational resources that allow them to pursue their dreams. Students from lower socio-economic backgrounds are at a disadvantage and require additional support to achieve their full potential. Moreover, our freedom of choice is amplified in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. Every choice we make now impacts not only ourselves but also the greater community. The pandemic has illustrated how different freedoms can come into conflict with each other when public health and economic stability are at odds. The choices we make could have life or death consequences. Wearing masks and practicing social distancing become crucial in mitigating the spread of the virus. By actively considering the impact of our actions on those around us, we can make the world a better place. At this point, one could argue that the cost of our freedom of choice is too high. The freedom to disregard the needs of others for individual gain ultimately leads to an unjust society. Empathy becomes essential at this stage. Empathizing with those who have been negatively impacted by our choices allows us to build a more equitable future. A society that values the right to education, access to basic resources such as food, shelter, and clean water. The freedom of choice is a responsibility. It is necessary to make our choices informed and guided by empathy. I am now moving on to college, and while the pressure to succeed remains, I have learned that the way towards success is different for everyone. I will take every step that allows me to exercise my right to freedom of choice while still being mindful of its impact on society. In conclusion, as a senior, I believe that our freedom of choice entails a responsibility to those around us. Our choices are rooted in privilege, and we must exercise them at the expense of no one. Empathy and understanding the consequences of our actions become essential tools in the quest for building a better world. The nuances of the freedom of choice need to be acknowledged, and we need to continue to work towards elevating the opportunities and resources available to all.",0,2.542502651,2.826008632,2.993355195,3.097433504,2.966550068,13.0,17.0,19.0,20.0,18.0
H,549,"I was in 9th grade the first time I stumbled upon a copy of Newsweek. What caught my eye was its trademark title: white type, red highlight, a connotation that stories of great consequence lay beneath. Such bold lettering gave me a moment's pause, and I was prompted to leaf through its glossy pages. To my surprise, I was instantly hooked. A new world unfolded before me. Biting social commentary. World conflicts that weren't dumbed down. Piquant reviews of best-selling books, controversial exposés of political figures, tantalizing tidbits on pop culture, full-page spreads of photographs. And the prose was elegant, sharp, mesmerizing. It radiated sophistication and IQ. As I scanned the credentials of the authors, my only thought was, wow. The articles were written by worldly, ambitious people who were experts in their fields, people with PhDs and MBAS from world-class institutions, people who could write brilliantly, who got paid to give their opinions, who walked with a purpose and ran in the direction of their dreams. People I knew — then and there — I’d like to one day become. This is what education looks like, I told myself. I was young, I was impressionable. Like a child standing on the outside of a candy store, nose pressed against the glass, I hungered to be a part of that cerebral adult world. So I read that magazine from cover to cover. Twice. And with each turn of the page I felt my small-town naïveté break into smaller and smaller pieces. I remember that day as an incredibly humbling experience. I had an awkward, self-conscious epiphany: that I actually knew next to nothing about the world. There I was, cream of the crop of my middle school, fourteen years of 'smart' outwitted by a thin volume of paper. I was used to feeling gifted, to getting gold stickers and good grades, to acing every elementary examination placed in front of my cocky #2 pencil. I wasn't used to feeling like I'd been living in the Dark Ages. At the same time, however, I struggled with another realization, one that was difficult for me to define. I felt. . . liberated. I felt as though I had taken a breath of fresh air and found it to be bracing and delicious, like it was the first breath I'd ever taken, and I'd never known that air was so sweet. Talk about a paradigm shift: somehow, reading Newsweek had re-kindled my natural intellectual curiosity; it had, briefly, filled a hole in my soul that I didn't know existed. It had also sparked something within me-a hint of defiance, a refusal to accept complacency. One taste of forbidden fruit, and I knew I could never go back. Although reading a news magazine seemed like a nonevent at the time, in retrospect it was one of the defining moments of my adolescence. That seemingly unextraordinary day set a lot of subsequent days in motion-days when I would push my limitations, jump a little higher, venture out of my comfort zone and into unfamiliar territory, days when I would fail over and over again only to succeed when I least expected it, days when I would build my dreams from scratch, watch them fall down, then build them back up again, and before I knew it, the days bled into years, and this was my life. At 14, I'd caught a glimpse of where the bar was set. It always seemed astronomically high, until it became just out of my grasp. Sadly, Newsweek magazine went out of print on January 1, 2013. Odd as it may sound, I'll always be indebted to an out-of-print magazine for helping me become the person I am today.",1,2.178114143,2.437516611,2.669657863,3.095942034,2.554339882,6.2,12.4,15.6,22.0,13.0
C0,550,"For as long as I can remember, my mornings always began the same way: with a steaming cup of coffee and the rustling of pages as my father sat reading Newsweek magazine at the kitchen table. Growing up, this became my first introduction to the world outside my small town. Each issue was a portal into global affairs, thought-provoking feature articles, and cultural discussions that expanded my horizons far beyond the limits of my hometown. In a world of fast-paced social media updates and instant gratification, I discovered the value of slow but steady journalism. With each issue, I felt a newfound sense of wonder and intrigue as I delved deeper into the stories of people and places that I'd never thought I would explore. The impact of Newsweek magazine on my life has been profound. It has stirred my curiosity, opened my mind to new ideas, and showed me that there is so much more to the world than what is within arm’s reach. It has been the catalyst for my growth, igniting a passion for exploration that has followed me throughout my high school years. In my freshman year, I stumbled upon a Newsweek article on the perils of environmental pollution. Reading about the astounding effects of climate change and its impact on vulnerable communities around the world, I felt a spark light up within me. With an eagerness to take action, I joined the environmental club at my school. Working with like-minded individuals, I organized several awareness campaigns in my community, including a tree-planting event to combat deforestation. Our efforts resulted in raised awareness and even landed us recognition in our school newsletter. As the world plunged into an unprecedented pandemic last year, my reliance on Newsweek only grew stronger. I eagerly awaited each issue to stay updated on the ever-evolving situation, and found solace in the stories of everyday heroes that worked tirelessly on the front lines to save lives. One particular Newsweek article that stood out to me was about a team of doctors that had traveled to India to set up makeshift hospitals and aid stations in remote villages. Reading about their selfless service, inspired me to also take action. With the pandemic raging on, I wanted to make a difference even in the smallest way possible. I joined a support group for front-line healthcare workers, writing heartfelt letters of gratitude and encouragement to doctors and nurses who were putting their lives at risk. Through the lens of Newsweek magazine, I discovered the power of human connection, the importance of solidarity, and the magic of shared experiences. It taught me that even in the face of adversity, we can come together, united in empathy and compassion. At school, I have become deeply invested in the subjects of history and global politics. My love for these fields began with an introduction to world leaders and decision makers, as well as profound events changing the course of history. Reading Newsweek’s analysis of events and political figures have given me an understanding of the complexities of different political systems and ideologies. In my sophomore year, I spent the summer immersed in an advanced program exploring international political science. Through fellow students and different speakers, I had the opportunity to further explore different political theories and history that had been written in Newsweek. The exposure to different cultural beliefs helped me inculcate a better understanding of world affairs. In my junior year, I was actively participating in a national debate event where my love for Newsweek magazine shone through. In the face of stiff competition, the weekly insights and analytical opinion pieces from the publication gave me an edge over the challengers who were grappling to form their opinions on current events. I was able to represent my school nationally, and had the opportunity to meet many students who had the same interests and love for the power of journalism that had ignited in me years ago. As I prepare for college, I look back on my life with a deep sense of gratitude for the influence of Newsweek magazine. Its informative and thought-provoking content helped shape my perspectives, deepen my understanding of global affairs, and nurture my passion for social justice. From learning about momentous historical figures and great thinkers, to exploring the lives of ordinary people who battled insurmountable odds, Newsweek has been with me every step of the way. Through its pages, I have discovered a love for empathy, a fascination for diverse cultures, and an unwavering belief in the power of positive change. Now, as I write this essay, I realize that my love for journalism has deepened and I aspire to pursue this field in college. My dream is to give back to society by producing thoughtful, investigative reporting that has the ability to inform, inspire, and make a difference – just as Newsweek has done for me.",0,2.866130881,3.204567571,3.341109903,3.572577853,3.292453081,16.0,21.0,24.0,30.0,22.5
C1,551,"Growing up, I have always been a keen reader with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and understanding. This yearning first led me to Newsweek, a publication that has been a constant source of inspiration and enlightenment throughout my teenage years. It has not only informed me on global affars, but also sparked a passion in me for journalism, which I hope to continue pursuing in college. For me, Newsweek has always been more than just a magazine. It is a gateway into different worlds, filled with stories of humanity, daring, and adventure. It has been a window into the many issues that dominate our world, providing me with an in-depth analysis of politics, economics, culture and society, all eyes open to the complex and multifaceted nature of these issues. While reading Newsweek, I have found myself stepping into different perspectives and experiencing the world beyond my community. I’ve been exposed to rich and diverse cultures, challenged in thinking about the world, and forced to confront my own biases and prejudices. For instance, last year, Newsweek ran a series of articles on the ongoing Black Lives Matter and racial justice protests. The articles beautifully and fearlessly explored themes of systemic racism, representation, and inequality. Reading these articles opened my eyes to the racial injustices in the United States and other parts of the world. Inspired by these articles, I joined a local youth social justice group that had been formed to combat racism and promote equality. Through organized events, I worked with other young people to spread awareness and initiate conversations around the issues of racism and social inequality in our community. In my free time, I’ve also written several opinion pieces, channeling my passion for journalism into effecting change in my community. Recently, an op-ed I wrote on the growing necessity of climate action was published on the Newsweek website. The experience not only emboldened me to keep pursuing journalism but also showed that my passion for social issues could be shared with others. My love for Newsweek has been so great that I received a subscription as a birthday present last year. Every issue has been a welcomed comfort, each page inked with carefully researched, well-written articles that offer depth and precision. What’s even more impressive about Newsweek is the diversity of its staff writers and contributors. It has gone a step ahead to cultivate a diverse pool of journalists, writers and editors with different backgrounds, knowledge and ideas, whose voices are all included and heard. As a young individual, it is refreshing to read stories written by people who come from different backgrounds, countries and experiences. I believe journalism is a calling, a chance to tell captivating stories, uncover hidden truths, and report on pressing issues. My passion for journalism has grown over the years, and I am confident that Newsweek has taught me much of what I know about this dynamic field. It is for all these reasons that I am so excited about attending college, where I hope to continue using journalism to impact our society in positive ways. I strongly believe that through writing, the power of the pen can be a light, allowing us to understand and appreciate our differences and to come together with greater empathy and understanding. Given the opportunity to study at Yale or Harvard, my goal is to combine my passion for journalism with my love for international relations in order to make a meaningful contribution to society. My time with Newsweek has inspired me to use my voice and writing skills to bridge the cultural and ideological gaps that exist in the world today, and to help further our collective understanding of global issues.",0,2.978764331,3.159705426,3.286854644,3.538769498,3.249666332,18.0,20.0,23.0,27.8,21.0
C2,552,"As I sat in my high school classroom, I couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. The fluorescent lights flickered above, casting a sickly white light across the room. The drone of the air conditioning unit buzzed in the background, drowning out the occasional rustle of papers and cough from students. I picked up a copy of Newsweek, my only solace from the mundanity of the classroom. As I flipped through the magazine, the pages crackled and rustled, each one revealing another fascinating story. I drank in the vivid color photographs that captured intimate moments from across the world. The scents of ink and paper filled my nostrils, and the feel of the rough pages against my fingertips reminded me of the rough, gritty reality of the world. It was then that I stumbled upon an article that struck a deep chord within me. It spoke of the rise in mental health issues among teenagers, and the subtle ways in which these issues hide within society. The article described the silent suffering of teenagers, the way that mental health issues often go unnoticed and untreated, leading to devastating consequences. I knew then that I had to do something. This feeling, this tugging sense of purpose, was unlike anything I had ever experienced. I began volunteering at a local mental health clinic, listening to the stories and struggles of people who had experienced unimaginable trauma. The smell of disinfectant that permeated the clinic brought me back to reality, grounding me in the moment and reminding me of the strength of the human spirit. As I listened to these stories, I began to see the subtle ways in which mental health issues hid within our society. I saw the way in which shame, fear, and societal pressure influenced the way that people reacted to and experienced mental health issues. And so I started a mental health organization at my school. We held workshops and assemblies, bringing in experts and professionals to talk about the importance of mental health care. The sharp sound of my pen scribbling notes onto paper filled the air as I worked tirelessly to ensure that every student at my school had access to resources and tools to help them when they were struggling. But it wasn't enough. I realized that in order to make a real difference, I needed to become a part of the solution. I started volunteering at a research lab, studying the complexity of mental health and the nuances of various disorders. The sound of the clanking machinery and whir of computers filled the lab, as we worked day and night to better understand the human mind. Through this research, I began to see the subtle ways in which mental health issues hid within society. I saw the way in which the stigma surrounding mental health prevented people from seeking help. The way that language and societal attitudes towards mental health could either help or harm individuals struggling with these issues. And so I began to work towards advocacy at a state and national level, lobbying for changes in policy and funding to improve mental health care for everyone. I began to see the small ways in which advocacy could bring about large-scale change, the way that the sound of hundreds of voices could make a difference in the world. I owe all of this to Newsweek, to the magazine that first ignited my deep sense of intellectual curiosity. That magazine opened my eyes to the complexities of the world, reminding me of my place within it. But it was more than that. It was the sound of my pen on paper, the feel of the rough pages beneath my fingertips, the smell of bleach in the air. It was the way that these sensory details grounded me in the present moment, reminding me of the importance of the work that I was doing. Intellectual curiosity is more than just a vague sense of interest or a mild fascination with a topic. It is a powerful force that drives us towards action, towards tangible, meaningful change. As I continue on my journey, I am reminded of the importance of cultivating intellectual curiosity in all its forms. The way that it can lead us towards unexpected paths, towards moments of profound discovery and deep purpose. So thank you, Newsweek, for igniting my intellectual curiosity and for reminding me of the importance of seeking knowledge and taking action. Thank you for the way that your stories have brought me into the lives of others, grounding me in the reality of the world around me. And as I move forward, continuing to advocate for mental health issues and create meaningful change in the world, I am forever grateful for the role that you have played in my journey.",0,2.575413231,2.879002398,3.028268762,3.30031627,2.950494837,15.8,18.0,22.0,25.2,19.0
H,553,"Two hundred and two Hot Wheels cars, each two by five inches long, adorned with flames and spoilers, lined the edges of my room. My mother would urge me to put them away and go play outside, but I never wanted to. I drove those cars all around the house. They intrigued my six-year-old self. I loved my collection that I had hand picked on my own. Every single one of those 99-cent cars was mine. I never fathomed, however, that it would not take nearly as long for that collection to disappear as it took to grow. After July 6, 2006, I never saw my collection again. On that day, I squinted to get one last glance at the front door of my home. 50 Greenridge Way was a quaint, two-story home in a quiet suburb of Rockland County, New York. My mother was six months pregnant with me when my parents signed the papers in 1997. They were proud of themselves—they had something that was theirs. My mother and father were determined to achieve the American Dream. They saved up for their baby grand piano, and they worked hard so that my sister and I could paint our rooms pink and blue like the ones on the cover of PB Teen. They did not know, however, how fast what they attained could disappear. The unanticipated vicissitudes of owning a small business left my parents struggling to pay the mortgage, unable to feed the rapid growth of their dream. They desperately reached out for help and fell victim to a mortgage scam. Legally outsmarted and outspent, my family continued to struggle until we could no longer fight. After thousands of dollars of debt, countless phone calls, and many tears, we lost the battle. On July 6, 2006, we were told we had six hours to get out. Six hours. Six hours to get out of something filled with nine years of work, a lot of money and an immeasurable amount of emotion—six hours to pack up our lives and move them somewhere else. Day laborers were instructed to come and throw our belongings onto the front lawn. Family and neighbors flocked over, all agreeing to store as much as they could. I scrambled to find the things important to me. I threw my blankie, my Gameboy and my Build-A-Bear into a small duffle bag. As I rushed into my aunt’s car, my eyes glued to the movers tossing my mom’s favorite Diego Rivera painting onto the street, I felt uneasy. Many questions should have been going through my eight-year-old head, but only one did: where are my 202 cars? For the next five years, my family was homeless. Many doors were slammed in our faces, and we were given the “one night maximum” package in many of our family members’ homes. However, the takeaway from this experience is not what I learned about the behavior of others—it is what I learned about character. The values that cannot be touched—my experience, resilience, and faith—built more character in me than any two by five inch car or baby grand piano ever will. Losing every single one of our belongings by theft and storage unit auctions, including my 202 cars, showed my family that the intangible things that got us through hardship are everlasting. The six horus spent leaving our home felt so remarkably unequivalent to the nine years we spent enriching it, or the 8 years I spent growing my car collection. However, those unexpected losses taught me that a loss of my possessions was not a loss of my character. Even in the hotels, cars, and basements, this experience showed me that no matter how little my family had, we would always have the privilege to hope. My family has been pushed into brief bouts of homelessness since the incident, and may be facing our next bout in the coming days. Although I still worry about our financial status, a feeling of overwhelming faith creeps up my spine and deadens that anxiety. Our faith and tenacity will never be plundered like our possessions. My unseemingly unshakable phobia of losing “everything” again has diminished over the years because if I lose my possessions again, I know I will not be losing “everything.” The next chapter of my life will signal the beginning of newer, and perhaps tougher, challenges, but through all of the uncertainty and worry, I will be letting out a sigh of relief. None of our possessions, including that carefully constructed collection of two hundred and two cars, adorned with flames and spoilers, were the vehicles that drove my family through the five years of turmoil. It was our intangibles that did.",1,2.34445042,2.73398735,2.988482236,3.498525455,2.801870628,10.2,14.0,19.0,25.8,16.5
C0,554,"It was the middle of the night when I realized my backpack was missing. My stomach tightened as I thought of all the important documents, textbooks, and notes inside it. Frantically, I searched my dorm room, but my backpack was nowhere to be found. It was gone. At first, I panicked. How was I going to make up for the lost materials? What kind of schoolwork was I going to miss? It was then that I remembered a life-changing lesson that the universe had bestowed upon me: the loss of possessions builds character. Growing up in a privileged household had allowed me to accumulate numerous possessions without ever worrying about the consequences of losing them. That was until the moment my backpack went missing. It was in that difficult moment that I began to understand the true power of loss. As I began the process of replacing my belongings, I found that I was missing more than just a backpack. I was also missing the learning experience that comes with unique challenges. Before the loss of my backpack, I never had to adapt to unexpected setbacks or think on my feet to create solutions. Now, I was forced to step up to the challenge and learn how to navigate through unforeseen complications. For example, the loss of my backpack allowed be me to learn about the importance of communication when it comes to keeping track of my belongings. I reached out to my friends, classmates, and teachers for help, and through this experience, I discovered an unexpected sense of community. My classmates and teachers offered their notes, textbooks and lectures, while my friends even offered to share their clothes and personal items. This was an enlightening moment for me because it allowed me to reflect on the people that surround me and the immense amount of support they provide. It was only through the loss of my possessions that I was able to truly appreciate the people in my life and their kindness. Moreover, the loss of my backpack also taught me to prioritize my belongings and my time. I came to the realization that my textbooks and notes were critical to my academic success and that loss is a part of life that we all must acknowledge. I began to take extra care of my belongings, keeping them in safe and secure places rather than leaving them around carelessly. This loss also taught me to manage my time better; I would not let something as insignificant as my backpack define my life or my academic performance. Instead of mourning its loss, I chose to focus on the present and utilized the time I had to study and learn more. The experience of the loss of my backpack has become a significant part of my life's narrative. It allowed me to develop critical thinking skills and learn a valuable lesson: the loss of possessions is not really a loss, rather it is an opportunity for growth, learning, and character development. It taught me to value people, prioritize my belongings, and manage my time better. While this experience was difficult to bear at first, it ultimately made me stronger and taught me that life is full of challenges, and that it is up to me to confront them head-on. Today, my backpack is no longer a source of fear, rather it is a source of inspiration: it reminds me of the lessons I have learned and the adversity I have overcome. In conclusion, the loss of possessions builds character. It may seem counterintuitive, but it is through moments of loss that we gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us. It teaches us to appreciate the people in our lives, prioritize our time and belongings, and develop our critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. As I embark on the next stage of my life, I know that I will encounter many more setbacks and losses, but I am ready to face them head-on because the lessons that come with the loss of possessions have taught me that setbacks are just opportunities for growth.",0,2.504645239,2.826093555,2.962140337,3.185526892,2.879040072,13.2,17.2,22.0,26.4,22.0

We faced brief homelessness bouts, with doors being slammed in our faces, and being given temporary shelter from family members. We lost everything by theft and storage unit auctions, including my beloved car collection. However, this experience taught me the importance of character in the face of loss. Growing up in a privileged household, I had assumed that possessions were the markers of success. But when everything was lost, I discovered that the intangible values that we possess are far more crucial than the objects themselves. Our experience, resilience, and faith will always be with us, regardless of our material possessions. In the months after the loss, I became more aware of my surroundings.

I close my eyes and take a deep breath, letting the crisp autumn air fill my lungs. The serenity of the moment reminds me of the importance of mindfulness and being present in the moment. For so long, I took my daily routine for granted, not appreciating the beauty of the world surrounding me. However, my experience of loss taught me the importance of mindfulness and the power of simple pleasures. Before our loss, I was worried about the next test, the next prom, and the next material possession. But in the face of loss, all of those material things became meaningless. During our homelessness, we found shelter with various family members, and I learned how empathy and understanding connect us. One day, I met my cousin who had lost her husband six months before. Her tears while recalling her memories of him made me realize that we are all human, and we all have our struggles. It was then that I discovered the power of compassion and empathy. I took this lesson into my daily interactions, understanding that a kind word or a simple gesture can make a world of difference to those around us. My experience taught me the significance of reaching out and showing care for others. In the years after our loss, my family worked tirelessly to rebuild our lives. We didn't know what the future held, but we were determined to overcome the adversity we faced. Watching my parents' resilience and the grit with which they faced the world, I learned the meaning of unrelenting character. In the face of adversity, we discovered the importance of inner strength and the ability to overcome challenges. My parents fought fiercely to hold our family together, and they did so with the utmost grace and dignity. Their experience taught me that determination and perseverance are the key to overcoming any challenge. Finally, my loss taught me that faith is an essential factor in our ability to overcome life's obstacles. In the darkest moments of our homelessness, I turned to prayer and meditation for comfort. And while our circumstances did not change overnight, my faith allowed me to find peace in the present moment and hope for the future. Growing up, I had never thought much about faith, but our loss opened my eyes to the power of belief. Faith is what helped our family overcome our adversity, reminding us that we are never alone in our struggles. In conclusion, my experience of loss has taught me a great deal about character. The simple pleasures in life, empathy, resilience, perseverance, and faith are the foundations on which we should build our lives. The material possessions that we accumulate are fleeting, but the values that we hold dear will stay with us forever.

H,557,"It was five o’clock in the morning, and an intruder was in my home. His vile gurgling sounds had crawled into my room and slinked under my covers, and his deafening beeps had yanked me from sleep. I now lay frozen, listening intently for any other noises—footsteps, perhaps? The screams of my family members?—but the house fell silent. Slowly, I slid out of bed and tiptoed into the dark hallway. The intruder was definitely near—his distinct, woody odor had infiltrated the air. And with each timid step toward the kitchen, upon reaching the door, I could hardly breathe. Ever so slowly, I pushed it open and scanned the room. There, gloating next to the fridge, sat “Mr. Coffee.” Twenty-four hours earlier, this machine was not here. Twenty-four hours earlier, I had risen from my sleep and ambled into the kitchen to brew a cup of joe not from a coffee maker, but from my family’s old French press. It was a routine that jump-started every morning: grinding the oh-so-slightly toasted beans into an aromatic dust, blanketing the bottom of the glass vessel, listening to the kettle whistle on the stove, and then submerging the roast to create a bold espresso. After I filled a steaming mug, I’d be energized for the day—infused with caffeine and enthused with the artistic process. But the press was now missing; its home invaded by this new contraption. Just as my eyes narrowed with suspicion, my yawning father meandered into the room. “Hey… what is this?” I gestured to Mr. Coffee. “Ah, yes!” he chimed, “That’s our new coffee maker!” “Oh.” My feeling of betrayal must have been palpable, because he raised his eyebrows sharply. “Is something wrong? Margot, come on—this is much more convenient than the old press.” The machine agreed with him; blinking its bright lights and humming haughtily. Then, as if to prove that it was indeed the most efficient appliance ever created, it once again began to pump out an endless flood of muddy liquid. I deliberated. My father was right, of course—the French press was unarguably time consuming and cumbersome, especially at 5:00 AM—but it was tangible. It was real. Crafting coffee in the morning afforded me a sense of pride and artistry that always inspired the rest of my day. Every cup was a learning experience—fixing the flavors, tweaking the temperatures—but it was only now, after the press had been replaced, that I realized how much I truly appreciated it. Our French Press is now long gone, but its memory is a constant reminder to apply meaningful effort and a creative touch to all of my endeavors. Whether doing research, coaching a swim practice, or simply playing Scrabble with my family, I invest myself completely. Yes, I may work a little slower, I might go over the top sometimes.

C0,558,"Coffee is more than just a beverage. It’s an art form; a craft that requires patience, precision and a delicate touch. I discovered this firsthand when I began working at a local coffee shop in my small town. What started as a part-time job soon became a passion that opened my eyes to the intricacies and subtleties of coffee making. Today, I understand that coffee making is not only about brewing the perfect cup, but also about understanding the cultural and historical importance of this beloved beverage. At its essence, coffee is a simple drink made from brewed coffee beans and water. However, it is the process of making coffee that transforms it from a commodity into an experience. When I first started working at the coffee shop, I was intimidated by the process. The scientific measurements, the detailed instructions, the high expectations - it all seemed overwhelming. But as I began to learn each of the steps involved, I found myself continually mesmerized by the art form before me. The process of coffee making became a therapeutic practice - from carefully grinding the beans to pouring the perfect latte art. With each cup I made, I began to see the cultural importance of coffee. Coffee has long played a significant role in global history, a role that is still prevalent today. Breaking bread with someone while sipping coffee is a common practice in cultures across the world. My coworkers, for example, were from all over the globe - one from Brazil, another from Ethiopia and one from Colombia. Each person had a unique perspective on how to make coffee, and I relished in hearing their stories and learning from their techniques. This experience taught me that coffee is not only a drink but is also a bridge between cultures, a way of bringing people together, no matter their backgrounds. But coffee’s importance extends beyond cultural significance. The process of making coffee is also tied to environmental sustainability. The global coffee industry is heavily reliant on the natural environment, including water, soil, and forests. The coffee plant, a delicate crop that grows primarily in tropical regions, can be heavily impacted by deforestation, soil degradation, and climate change. Coffee made sustainably, on the other hand, honors the delicate connection between people and the environment, ensuring that both thrive. At the coffee shop, we made a concerted effort to use only sustainably sourced coffee beans that were grown and harvested in a way that promoted environmental stewardship. My experience as a barista showed me the significance of the art of coffee making. It revealed that coffee is not just another beverage, but is instead an entry point into a broader cultural and environmental conversation. As I head off to college, I want to continue exploring the different aspects of coffee culture and find ways to promote a more sustainable and inclusive coffee industry. As a student, I look forward to expanding my understanding of how coffee interacts with different disciplines like environmental science, business, and economics. With each cup of Joe I enjoy, I’ll think about how the economics of the plant impact the welfare of farmers and the global supply chain. I’ll consider the environmental impact of my coffee addiction and the ways in which we can prevent further destruction of natural resources. In conclusion, coffee is far more than a simple drink. It is an art form that has the power to connect people, cultures and the environment. Through my experience as a barista, I came to appreciate the intricacies of coffee culture and the ways in which it speaks to broader themes of sustainability, economics and culture. As I prepare to attend college, I look forward to continuing my exploration of these themes and finding ways to promote a more just and inclusive global coffee industry.

C1,559,"Coffee is often considered a go-to drink for fast-paced mornings, but it can also be savored as a work of art. This is something I learned when I visited a small café in my town while studying for my SATs. As I walked through the door, the aroma of the freshly roasted beans hit me, making me feel invigorated. I approached the counter, and that's when I met the barista who helped me discover the true artistry of coffee. As I placed my order, I noticed the tools that the barista had on his counter. There was a scale, a timer, and a classy pour-over kettle. Each tool had a specific purpose, and the barista used them with precision, as if he was performing a magical ritual. I was amazed, my interest piqued. The barista noticed my curiosity and began to explain the process of making coffee. He talked about how different beans from different parts of the world varied in flavor, texture, and acidity. He also talked about the importance of selecting the right roast for a particular brew method. As he spoke, I was transfixed, realizing something that I never had before: coffee is much more complex than I thought. My coffee arrived, with the barista making sure to place it down carefully. I took my first sip and was amazed by the complexity of the flavor. The unique taste of the coffee was not simply because it was well-roasted but also because of the time and attention that went into making it. I started visiting the café frequently, and each visit taught me something new about coffee making. I began to experiment with different brew methods myself, starting with the ever-reliable French press. I would wake up early every morning and spend time grinding the beans, measuring the water and timing the steep. Each day was a mini-science experiment and a challenge to craft the perfect brew. Over time, I realized that coffee making was about more than just the drink. It was about attention to detail, thoughtful consideration, and a respect for the craft. Coffee making was an act of love and devotion, and it required slowing down and taking the time to appreciate each step of the process. As I look ahead to my future, I see myself studying at top universities like Yale or Harvard, learning about the world and exploring new ideas. And with each new idea I discover, I will carry my love of coffee with me. I’ll take pleasure in grinding the beans by hand or perfecting the pour on a Chemex. Each cup will be a reminder that in every field of study, there is a process and a craft that deserves our attention and respect. In conclusion, coffee is an art form that requires attention to detail, precision, and a passion for the craft. It has the power to surprise us with its complexity and delight us with its flavors. My experience in the barista’s café taught me much about the world of coffee and, by extension, about the nature of the artistry present in all things. This passion will be with me as I prepare to attend college, exploring new ideas and learning about the world. I will always be reminded to take the time to respect the process, to slow down and savor the moments that make life beautiful.",0,2.654895098,2.796142644,2.944413378,3.041396062,2.878490252,14.0,16.0,19.0,21.0,18.0
C2,560,"As I enter the bustling hallways of my high school, the sound of echoing footsteps and locker doors slamming greets me. The acrid smell of florescent lighting mixes with the sharp scent of teenage sweat. The scene is chaotic, with students rushing from one class to another, but my favorite spot is the library. The library is a quiet haven, in sharp contrast to the chaos outside. The smell of old books and fresh paper welcomes me. The room is dimly lit and cozy. The carpet beneath my feet is soft and plush, muffling the sound of footsteps. As I navigate the maze of bookshelves, I feel the anticipation rising in me, as a hunting dog would before finding its prey. One particular day, I was searching for a book about ancient civilizations for a project, but the book that caught my attention was one about Cleopatra, with a dazzling cover. The book seemed to call to me, urging me to pick it up, to hold it close, to experience it. I took the book to a small seat by the window and began to read. As I turned the pages, I felt transported to another world, where ancient Egypt was alive and thriving. The descriptions were rich and vivid, allowing me to see the bustling markets, the grand palaces, and the shimmering Nile. The sound of sandals on the hot sand and the jingling of coins filled my ears as I journeyed through the book. The descriptions were not just about what the characters saw or heard but about the feelings they experienced. I felt the fear and anxiety of Cleopatra during political turmoil and the excitement she felt about the prospect of victory. As I read, the world around me faded away. The book gave me an insight that I would not have gained in any other way. I learned about the struggles and achievements of Queen Cleopatra, the cultural norms of her time, and the political climate in which she lived. The book achieved something few things could do: it made me forget about my own problems, my own world, and allowed me to step into someone else's shoes. The Cleopatra book taught me more about the value of literature than any other book ever has. Books are not just stories but windows through which we explore lives different from our own. They open our minds to new ideas, teach us about different cultures, and shape our understanding of the world. They challenge us to think beyond ourselves and to consider the experiences of others. In my own life, I have seen the effects of literature in shaping an individual's perspective. Growing up in a small town, I was raised in a homogeneous environment, surrounded by the same ideas and opinions. It wasn't until I started reading books from different cultures and histories that I gained a wider perspective on the world. As I look towards the future and attending universities like Yale or Harvard, I know that literature will continue to shape my perspective. I want to read the works of authors from different backgrounds, to explore new ideas, to challenge myself. I want to learn about the experiences of people who have lived different lives from my own, to understand not just what they see or hear but what they feel. In conclusion, the library is a special place for me, a quiet haven where I can escape the chaos of high school and read books that inspire me in ways that daylight sometimes fails to do. The Cleopatra book was but one of many that taught me about the power of literature, to inspire and enlighten. As I prepare for college, I see the pursuit of knowledge not just as academic but as something personal and lifelong. To continue to grow, to continue to learn, to continue to be inspired by the ideas and experiences of others.",0,2.6221554,2.803895511,3.003842566,3.22716178,2.8890681,14.6,18.0,20.0,22.4,19.5
H,561,"Clear, hopeful melodies break the silence of the night. Playing a crudely fashioned bamboo pipe, in the midst of sullen inmates—this is how I envision my grandfather. Never giving up hope, he played every evening to replace images of bloodshed with memories of loved ones at home. While my grandfather describes the horrors of his experience in a forced labor camp during the Cultural Revolution, I could only grasp at fragments to comprehend the story of his struggle. I floundered in this gulf of cultural disparity. As a child, visiting China each summer was a time of happiness, but it was also a time of frustration and alienation. Running up to my grandpa, I racked my brain to recall phrases supposedly ingrained from Saturday morning Chinese classes. Other than my initial greeting of “Ni hao, ye ye!” (“Hello, grandpa”), however, I struggled to form coherent sentences. Unsatisfied, I would scamper away to find his battered bamboo flute, and this time, with my eyes, silently beg him to play. Although I struggled to communicate clearly through Chinese, in these moments, no words were necessary. I cherished this connection—a relationship built upon flowing melodies rather than broken phrases. After each impromptu concert, he carefully guided my fingers along the smooth, worn body of the flute, clapping after I successfully played my first tentative note. At the time, however, I was unaware of that through sharing music, we created language of emotion, a language that spanned the gulf of cultural differences. Through these lessons, I discovered an inherent inclination toward music and a drive to understand this universal language of expression. Years later, staring at sheets of music in front of me at the end of a long rehearsal, I saw a jumbled mess of black dots. After playing through “An American Elegy” several times, unable to infuse emotion into its reverent melodies that celebrated the lives lost at Columbine, we—the All-State Band—were stopped yet again by our conductor Dr. Nicholson. He directed us to focus solely on the climax of the piece, the Columbine Alma Mater. He urged us to think of home, to think of hope, to think of what it meant to be American, and to fill the measures with these memories. When we played the song again, this time imbued with recollections of times when hope was necessary, “An American Elegy” became more than notes on a page; it evolved into a tapestry woven from the thread of our life stories. The night of the concert, in the lyrical harmonies of the climax, I envisioned my grandfather, exhausted after a long day of labor, instilling hope in the hearts of others through his bamboo flute. He played his own “elegy” to celebrate the lives of those who had passed. At home that night, no words were necessary when I played the alma mater for my grandfather through the video call. As I saw him wiping tears, I smiled in relief as I realized through music I could finally express the previously inexpressible. Reminded of warm summer nights, the roles now reversed, I understood the lingual barrier as a blessing in disguise, allowing us to discover our own language. Music became a bridge, spanning the gulf between my grandfather and me, and it taught me that communication could extend beyond spoken language. Through our relationship, I learned that to understand someone is not only to hear the words that they say, but also to empathize and feel as they do. With this realization, I search for methods of communication not only through spoken interaction, but also through shared experiences, whether they might involve the creation of music, the heat of competition, or simply laughter and joy, to cultivate stronger, more fulfilling relationships. Through this approach, I strive to become a more empathetic friend, student, and granddaughter as finding a common language has become, for me, a challenge—an invitation—to discover deeper connections.",1,2.816553441,3.073589224,3.269045824,3.605399823,3.144742911,16.8,20.8,26.0,28.6,22.0
C0,562,"Growing up in a multicultural family, I always knew that music had the power to transcend cultural barriers. As a child, I would listen to my dad play traditional Indian instruments and sing classical Indian ragas, while my mom would play American rock music. This unique blend of cultural influences ignited my love for music and shaped my diverse taste in music. But it wasn't until I was 12 years old that I truly experienced the power of music to connect people from different cultures. It was the summer of 2013, and I was visiting my grandparents in Mumbai, India. My cousin, who was the same age as me, introduced me to a group of local musicians who played traditional Indian folk music. Despite our language barrier, we started jamming together, and it wasn't long before we were communicating through the language of music. Our impromptu jam session lasted for hours, and even though I could not understand the lyrics of the songs we were playing, I could feel the emotions behind the music. We were connected, and it didn't matter that we came from different parts of the world, spoke different languages, and had different cultural backgrounds. We shared a universal language - music. This experience ignited my passion for exploring different styles of music, and I made it my mission to learn as much as I could about music from different cultures. I started listening to Japanese J-Pop, Korean K-Pop, Brazilian Samba, African Tribal music, and so much more. Each genre of music had its unique rhythm, instruments, and cultural significance. But what fascinated me the most was how I could relate to the emotions behind the music, no matter where it came from. Music is an integral part of every culture, and it reflects the history and traditions of a community. It is a way to celebrate, mourn, and express emotions. In India, the Sitar is played during festivals and weddings, while in Brazil, the Samba is danced during Carnival. In Japan, the Shamisen and Koto are played during traditional tea ceremonies, while in Africa, the Djembe is played during weddings and funerals. These traditional instruments and genres of music connect people to their roots and help them preserve their cultural identity. But, what happens when different cultures mix, and the boundaries between traditional and modern music blur? As someone who has experienced this firsthand, I can say that it can lead to magical musical experiences. For instance, when I was in Japan, I attended a concert by a Japanese pop band that blended traditional Japanese instruments like the Shamisen and Koto with modern pop beats. The concert was a fusion of traditional and modern Japanese styles, and it attracted a diverse audience, including me, as a foreigner. We were all connected by our love for music, and it didn't matter where we came from. Music has the power to bring people together, transcend language barriers, and create a sense of community. It is not just a form of entertainment; it is a way of connecting with oneself and others. Through music, we can learn about different cultures, empathize with people from diverse backgrounds, and celebrate our differences. As a musician and aspiring songwriter, I aim to create music that transcends cultural barriers and reflects the diverse world we live in. I believe that music is a powerful tool for social change, and I want to use it to promote diversity, unity, and tolerance. Through my music, I hope to inspire people to explore different cultures, break down stereotypes, and embrace diversity. I want to show people that music can be a unifying force that brings people of different backgrounds together. In conclusion, music is a universal language that transcends cultural barriers. It has the power to connect people from different parts of the world, celebrate diversity, and promote peace. As I embark on my journey towards a career in music, I will continue to explore different cultures and musical genres to create music that reflects our diverse world. I believe that music can break down barriers and bring people together, and I am committed to using music as a tool for positive change.",0,2.652816787,2.907806724,3.027767229,3.347070616,2.941964004,17.0,18.0,21.4,23.2,19.0
C1,563,"The night air is filled with the melodious strains of Indian classical music, mixed with the distant sounds of traffic and the laughter of street vendors. I am in the heart of Mumbai, India, surrounded by my cousins and grandparents, listening to my uncle play the tabla, a traditional Indian percussion instrument. The sound is electric, and for a moment, the world stands still. It is in this moment that I first become aware of the power of music to transcend cultures and boundaries. Growing up in a multicultural family, I was surrounded by diverse styles of music. I would listen to my dad play traditional Indian instruments, my mom's American rock music, and a mix of pop, reggae, and techno from my siblings. As I got older, I began to appreciate the beauty and significance of different styles of music from around the world. I started listening to Japanese J-Pop, Korean K-Pop, Brazilian Samba, African Tribal music, and so much more. Each genre of music had its unique rhythm, instruments, and cultural significance.

My personal journey of cultural exploration and self-discovery has taught me that music can be a force that brings people together, that it can communicate shared emotions and experiences that transcend language barriers. My passion for music was reignited when I visited my grandfather in China, and he played his homemade bamboo flute during a visit. Even though I struggled to communicate clearly through Chinese, I could still enjoy the music and share in its meaning with him. The experience showed me that communication could extend beyond spoken language, and sometimes it could be more effective that way. Music has the power to bring people together, transcend language barriers, and create a sense of community. It is not just a form of entertainment; it is a way of connecting with oneself and others. Through music, we can learn about different cultures, empathize with people from diverse backgrounds, and celebrate our differences. As a musician, I am determined to channel this power by crafting music that blends different cultural influences, promotes diversity, and encourages listeners to delve deeper into the rich tapestry of world music. I believe that through music, we can build bridges across cultures and create a more accepting, peaceful world. In conclusion, music has played a significant role in my life and cultural journey. It is a universal language that transcends cultures and boundaries, and connects people of different backgrounds. Through my music, I hope to promote unity, tolerance, and diversity, inspiring people everywhere to embrace and celebrate the richness of our diverse world. As the renowned cellist and conductor Yo-Yo Ma once said, 'In cultures where musicians learn through oral tradition, everyone is a musician, everyone can sing.

C2,564,"I can still hear the steady beat of the tabla, echoing through the streets of Mumbai like a heartbeat. As the music carried on, I savor the sweet aroma of street food, a mix of spices and flavors that tickled my senses. From the blaring horns of traffic to the cries of street vendors, Mumbai's hustle and bustle carried on around me, but for that brief moment, none of it seemed to matter. My grandfather's bamboo flute was a work of art, each note carrying its own character and meaning. His fingers moved delicately over the instrument, coaxing out a high-pitched trill that was almost ethereal. As the music filled the room, the air hummed with a sense of wonder and tranquility. I realized that music could move beyond words, a symbol of connection and feeling that anyone could appreciate. My grandfather might not have been there to share his language with me, but his music spoke volumes. There is a magic in music, one that can't be quantified or qualified – but it's there, nonetheless. The music fills the gaps where words falter, stirring strong emotions inside me. Even now, when I'm out for a walk or driving around town, there's a feeling that only music can create – one of unity, of understanding, of purpose. It is this magic that I want to harness and to share with others. Through my own songs, I want to create an eclectic mix of styles and sounds, layers of east and west, old and new, traditional and modern. I believe that music can be a conduit for change, a way to promote diversity and explore new cultural landscapes. Music is a way of celebrating the differences between us, of acknowledging that everyone has a unique rhythm and melody that makes them who they are. Growing up in a multicultural family, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in music from around the world. I found that every culture had its own sound – a powerful reflection of its people and ideals. Music is tiny access points into the soul of these cultures, as it reflects the traits, emotions, and ideals that they hold dear. The dreamy notes of Indian classical music captured Indian culture's high emotion and artistry; the upbeat rhythms of Latin-American Salsa demonstrated the party culture that dominates Latin-American; Korean K-pop's electronic beats and solid melody exhibited the breath of Korea's youth and tech fascination. Every musical style was like a window into another culture's soul, a chance to glimpse their way of life. My desire to create music has persisted through the years, with the realizations of its power growing with each song. Over time, a voice started taking shape in my songs, one that was heavily influenced by my multicultural upbringing. It is a voice that embraces differences, that advocates unity, and that shuns prejudice. It is the voice of musical expression. As a musician, I am excited about the creative possibilities that using different instruments and sounds can bring. I know that some might think blending styles dilutes the authenticity of both, but I believe that blending styles to form something new can often create a force stronger than the original. A cultural collaboration eliminates walls and boundaries and lets the world know that something wonderful and unique can be created when minds come together – regardless of distance, and philosophy gaps. Ultimately, music is about the human connection – one that transcends language, culture, race, and religion. The songs I create will never be merely a product – they will be something that embodies the parts of me that have come together to make them. They will be a symbol of unity, a beacon of hope, an offering of connection. As I sit and write this now, I feel a sense of gratitude and responsibility. I am grateful for the richness that comes from experiencing different cultures' music, and now it's time for me to return it. It is my responsibility to bring forth that magic, to use my voice in creating an intersection of cultures and languages. I am determined to create a push for cultural exploration using music, something new that represents our collective future. In the end, music is the beating heart of diversity. It is a force that unites and inspires us to dream, feel, connect and to become our best true selves. Indeed, music is an expressive symbol of life that helps shape us into who we are, so let us embrace it and let it guide us on a journey from Mumbai to everywhere.",0,2.658941201,2.872939142,2.978074643,3.080116941,2.937049758,16.0,18.0,20.0,26.0,19.0
H,565,"As a child raised on two continents, my life has been defined by the “What if…?” question. What if I had actually been born in the United States? What if my parents had not won that Green card? What if we had stayed in the USA and had not come back to Bulgaria? These are the questions whose answers I will never know (unless, of course, they invent a time machine by 2050). “Born in Bulgaria, lived in California, currently lives in Bulgaria” is what I always write in the About Me section of an Internet profile. Hidden behind that short statement is my journey of discovering where I belong. My parents moved to the United States when I was two years old. For the next four years it was my home country. I was an American. I fell in love with Dr. Seuss books and the PBS Kids TV channel, Twizzlers and pepperoni, Halloweens and Thanksgivings the yellow school bus and the “Good job!” stickers. It took just one day for all of that to disappear. When my mother said “We are moving back to Bulgaria,” I naively asked, “Is that a town or a state?” Twenty hours later I was standing in the middle of an empty room, which itself was in the middle of an unknown country. It was then that the “what if” — my newly imagined adversary—made its first appearance. It began to follow me on my way to school. It sat right behind me in class. No matter what I was doing, I could sense its ubiquitous presence. The “what if” slowly took its time over the years. Just when it seemed to have faded away, it reappeared resuming its tormenting influence on me—a constant reminder of all that could have been. What if I had won that national competition in the United States? What if I joined a Florida tennis club? What if I became a part of an American non-governmental organization? Would I value my achievements more if I had continued riding that yellow school bus every morning? But something—at first unforeseen and vastly unappreciated—gradually worked its way into my heart and mind loosening the tight grip of the “what if”—Bulgaria. I rediscovered my home country—hours spent in the library reading about Bulgaria’s history spreading over fourteen centuries, days reading books and comparing the Glagolitic and Cyrillic scripts, years traveling to some of the most remote corners of my country. It was a cathartic experience and with it finally came the discovery and acceptance of who I am. I no longer feel the need to decide where I belong. I am like a football fan that roots for both teams during the game. (If John Isner ever plays a tennis match against Grigor Dimitrov, I will definitely be like that fan.) Bulgaria and the USA are not mutually exclusive. Instead, they complement each other in me, whether it be through incorporating English words in my daily speech, eating my American pancakes with Bulgarian white brine cheese, or still having difficulty communicating through gestures (we Bulgarians are notoriously famous for shaking our heads side to side when we mean “yes” and nodding to mean “no). As a child raised on two continents, my life will be defined by the “What…?” question. What have Bulgaria and the USA given me? What can I give them back? What does the future hold for me?

C0,566,"To the casual observer, my identity as a “child of two continents” might seem to be a mere matter of geography. I was born in the United States to a father from West Africa and a mother from East Asia, and I have spent most of my life straddling the cultures, languages, and traditions of two vastly different regions of the world. But for me, this label is not just a fact of my birth or my upbringing--it is an integral part of my identity, shaping the way I view myself and the world around me. Growing up, I always felt like I was caught between two poles--between the brash, individualistic ethos of America and the more community-oriented, family-centric values of my parents' cultures. I navigated this tension in small ways, like when my classmates would ask me, “What are you?” (as if I were a strange creature or a new Pokemon), and I would try to explain my mixed heritage in terms they could understand. I also experienced it on a more profound level, when I was forced to confront the ways in which the world sometimes seemed to pit different cultures against one another, or to impose arbitrary hierarchies on them based on perceived differences. But over time, I began to embrace these tensions as something that made me unique, and as a source of strength rather than confusion. I saw how my multicultural background allowed me to see the world in a more nuanced way, to appreciate the beauty and complexity of different traditions, and to connect with people from all walks of life. I learned that I could be proud of my 'hybrid' identity, and that it was not something to shy away from or downplay. One of the most powerful moments of this realization came during a trip I took to visit my father's family in Ghana. Growing up, my father had always talked about his homeland with fondness and pride, telling us stories about its history, culture, and customs. But seeing it in person was a completely different experience. There were so many things that struck me--the vibrant colors of the clothing, the smell of spicy stew cooking over an open fire, the sound of drumming and singing at night. But what struck me most of all was the sense of community that pervaded every aspect of life there. In Ghana, it seemed like everyone knew everyone else, and that people looked out for each other in a way that I had never experienced in the US. I saw how people shared resources, stories, and joys and sorrows with one another, and how they valued connection and relationship above all else. I felt a pang of longing as I realized how different this was from the more individualistic culture I had grown up in, where people often valued autonomy and independence above community and interdependence. But as I spent more time in Ghana, I began to appreciate the ways in which these two cultures complemented each other. I saw how my own family's blend of Ghanaian and Chinese traditions had created a unique mix of values that emphasized both individual achievement and communal responsibility. And I realized that being a 'child of two continents' was not just about navigating intersecting cultures, but about having the freedom to create my own unique identity from the parts that spoke to me most deeply. This realization has shaped the way I approach everything from my academic studies to my extracurricular activities. In school, I have sought out classes and opportunities that allow me to explore a wide range of perspectives, from African literature to Chinese calligraphy. I have also looked for ways to connect with people from diverse backgrounds, like volunteering at a local immigration clinic and joining a multicultural student club. Outside of school, I have pursued creative projects that allow me to explore my own identity and express myself in tangible ways. I have begun to write about my experiences as a 'child of two continents' in the hopes of shedding light on the challenges and joys of being a part of two cultures. I have also started to experiment with fusion cooking, blending Ghanaian, Chinese, and American flavors in new and unexpected ways. As I prepare to embark on the next chapter of my life--potentially attending a university like Yale or Harvard--I am excited to see how my unique perspective will shape my experiences and contribute to the broader conversation. I know that I have something valuable to offer, both as a member of a larger academic community and as an individual with a rich and complex identity. Being a “child of two continents” has given me the gift of adaptability, of being able to communicate with people from varying backgrounds and cultures, and of using my experience in creative ways to solve problems. These skills make me confident that I am someone who can not only face challenges, but overcome them. It is my hope that I can take these skills and contribute to Yale or Harvard’s community of thinkers, innovators, and global citizens.",0,2.970871611,3.242067817,3.508329325,3.618680549,3.403998838,22.0,24.0,28.0,36.0,26.0
C1,567,"As someone who has lived their whole life as a “child of two continents,” I understand the complexities that come with straddling multiple cultures and traditions. My story began when my parents immigrated to the United States from South America when I was just a baby. I grew up speaking both English and Spanish, celebrating holidays from both American and Latin American cultures, and navigating the nuanced differences between various socioeconomic and racial groups. At times, this experience left me feeling like I didn't quite fit in anywhere--too 'American' for my family's traditional Latin American community, but also not fully 'American' enough to blend in as a typical American teenager. But as I got older, I began to see the benefits of having a multicultural background. I realized how it had allowed me to experience the best of both worlds--to be able to appreciate the individualism and self-expression of American culture while also valuing the importance of family, community, and tradition in Latin American culture. This awareness has informed my academic and personal pursuits in many ways. In high school, I took courses that challenged me to explore perspectives from different cultures, like studying the works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez in English and Spanish classes. I also sought out extracurricular activities that allowed me to connect with people from different backgrounds, like volunteering as a Spanish tutor for ESL students, or joining a multicultural club that celebrated diversity and inclusivity. But what has had the most significant impact on me, and what I believe sets me apart as a candidate for Yale or Harvard, is my passion for social justice and advocacy. As someone who has experienced firsthand the inequalities and injustices that exist within different communities and cultures, I am driven to make a difference in whatever way I can. For example, I have been involved with a nonprofit organization that works to provide healthcare access to underserved communities in Latin America. Through my involvement, I have been able to use my bilingual skills to communicate with patients and families, as well as to translate for medical professionals who don't speak Spanish. I have also helped to organize fundraising efforts and awareness campaigns to raise support and awareness for this critical cause. In addition to my work with this organization, I have also taken part in other advocacy efforts, such as participating in protests for immigrant rights and volunteering at local organizations that provide support for low-income families. I believe that my multicultural background has given me a unique perspective and a deep empathy for those who are underserved or marginalized, and I am committed to doing everything I can to make a positive impact on those around me. Ultimately, I believe that my experience as a “child of two continents” has not only shaped who I am today but also given me the skills and tools to make meaningful contributions to the world around me. I hope that by attending a university like Yale or Harvard, I can continue to learn from and grow alongside people from diverse backgrounds while also using my unique perspective and skillset to make a difference in whatever small way I can. In closing, I want to emphasize that my experience as a “child of two continents” is not a novelty or a mere aspect of my background. It is an integral part of who I am--and, I believe, a valuable and meaningful asset that I would bring to the Yale or Harvard community.

C2,568,"The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air as my parents sat down to have their breakfast. I was sitting at the table, watching them, trying to imitate their morning routine. My mother had prepared a traditional Latin American breakfast of eggs and arepas, and my father had brought home a newspaper from work. As they sipped their coffee and flipped through the pages of the paper, I couldn't help but feel like I was in two different worlds at once. Growing up, I straddled the line between my parents' Latin American culture and the American culture I was born into. While my parents tried to instill in me the traditions and values of their home country, I was also navigating the complexities and nuances of American culture. I was constantly juggling the expectations and norms of two cultures, trying to find a balance between them. It wasn't until I entered high school that I began to understand the unique perspective that my multicultural background gave me. I found that my ability to speak both English and Spanish fluently, as well as my knowledge of both cultures, gave me a unique advantage in understanding and communicating with people from different backgrounds. I began to see the world through a lens that was shaped by my experiences, and I knew that I wanted to use this perspective to make a difference in the world. One of the most significant experiences that helped me develop my social justice values was volunteering with a local nonprofit organization.

My involvement has allowed me to see firsthand the inequalities and injustices that exist within different communities and cultures, and how they affect people's access to healthcare. Through this work, I have been able to use my bilingual skills to communicate with patients and families and help bridge the gap between healthcare providers and patients who don't speak English. It has been a rewarding experience to be able to use my multicultural background to make a difference in people's lives. But I haven't stopped there. I have also taken part in other advocacy efforts, such as participating in protests for immigrant rights and volunteering at local organizations that provide support for low-income families. I believe that my multicultural background has given me a unique perspective and a deep empathy for those who are underserved or marginalized, and I am committed to doing everything I can to make a positive impact on those around me. In conclusion, my multicultural background has given me a lens through which to see the world that few others have. It has allowed me to appreciate the differences and nuances of different cultures while also seeing the commonalities that unite us all. As a candidate for Yale or Harvard, I am excited at the prospect of continuing my education and growth at an institution that values diversity, inclusivity, and social justice, and I am eager to see where this path will take me next.",0,2.890941663,3.054393364,3.513956854,3.658039725,3.255603781,19.0,21.0,27.0,32.0,22.0
H,569,"Bold white rafters ran overhead, bearing upon their great iron shoulders the weight of the skylight above. Late evening rays streamed through these sprawling glass panes, casting a gentle glow upon all that they graced—paper and canvases and paintbrushes alike. As day became night, the soft luminescence of the art studio gave way to a fluorescent glare, defining the clean rectilinear lines of Dillon Art Center against the encroaching darkness. It was a studio like no other. Modern. Sophisticated. Professional. And it was clean and white and nice. But it just wasn't it. Because to me, there was only one 'it,' and 'it' was a little less than two thousand miles west, an unassuming little office building located amidst a cluster of similarly unassuming little office buildings, distinguishable from one another on the outside only by the rusted numbers nailed to each door. Inside, crude photocopies of students' artwork plastered the once white walls. Those few openings in between the tapestry of art were dotted with grubby little handprints, repurposed by some overzealous young artist as another surface for creative expression. In the middle of the room lay two long tables, each covered with newspaper, upon which were scattered dried-up markers and lost erasers and bins of unwanted colored pencils. These were for the younger children. The older artists—myself included—sat around these tables with easels, in whatever space the limited confines of the studio allowed. The instructor sometimes talked, and we sometimes listened. Most of the time, though, it was just us—children, drawing and talking and laughing and sweating in the cluttered and overheated mess of an art studio. No, it was not so clean and not so white and not so nice. But I have drawn—rather, lived—in this studio for most of my past ten years. I suppose this is strange, as the rest of my life can best be characterized by everything the studio is not: cleanliness and order and structure. But then again, the studio was like nothing else in my life, beyond anything in which I've ever felt comfortable or at ease. Sure, I was frustrated at first. My carefully composed sketchbooks—the proportions just right, the contrast perfected, the whiteness of the background meticulously preserved—were often marred by the frenzied strokes of my instructor's charcoal as he tried to teach me not to draw accurately, but passionately. I hated it. But thus was the fundamental gap in my artistic understanding—the difference between the surface realities that I wanted to depict, and the profound though elusive truths of the human condition that art could explore. It was the difference between drawing a man's face and using abstraction to explore his soul. And I can't tell you exactly when or why my attitude changed, but eventually my own lines began to unabashedly disregard the rules of depth or tonality to which I had once dutifully adhered, my fervor leaving in its wake black fingerprints and smudges where once had existed unsoiled whiteness. It was in this studio that I eventually made the leap into a new realm of art—a realm in which I was neither experienced nor comfortable. Apart from surface manifestations altogether, this realm was simultaneously one of austere simplicity and aesthetic intricacy, of departure from realism and immersion in reality, of intense emotion and uninhibited expression. It was the realm of lines that could tell stories, of colors and figures that meant nothing and everything. Indeed, it was the realm of disorder and messy studios and true art—a place where I could express the world like I saw it, in colors and strokes unrestrained by expectations or rules; a place where I could find refuge in the contours of my own chaotic lines; a place that was neither beautiful nor ideal, but real. No, it was not so clean and not so white and not so nice. But then again, neither is art.",1,1.858315047,2.601995817,3.152380748,3.543563567,2.8096868,6.0,14.0,23.0,29.6,17.0
C0,570,"As I step into my art studio, I'm met with a flurry of colors and textures. Paintbrushes, pencils, and charcoal lie scattered across the table, and half-finished canvases are propped up against the walls. The floors are stained with acrylic paint and bits of eraser dust. But despite the clutter, I sense an air of creativity and inspiration in the room. For me, the messy art studio experience is part of what makes art so magical. Art has always been a significant part of my life. Ever since I was young, I found solace in drawing and painting. It was something I did on my own, a way to express myself without being judged or criticized. When I started taking art classes in school, the studio quickly became my favorite place to be. I remember my first day in the studio, nervous but excited to start. As I looked around at the other students' workspaces, I was struck by how chaotic they seemed. Papers were strewn across desks, paintbrushes were dripping with paint, and canvases were piled haphazardly against the walls. My neat freak tendencies recoiled at first, but soon enough, I realized that the mess was part of the experience. Art is messy. It's unpredictable, uncontrollable, and often downright chaotic. But that's what makes it so beautiful. When I'm painting or drawing, there's a sense of liberation that comes with the mess. I can let go of my fears and insecurities and immerse myself in the creative process. The chaos around me is a reminder that anything is possible when it comes to art. My messy art studio experience has taught me many valuable lessons. One of the most significant is the power of imperfection. In a world where we're constantly bombarded with images of perfection, the studio is a sanctuary for embracing our flaws. When I'm working on a piece, I'll often make mistakes or encounter unexpected challenges. But instead of getting discouraged, I've learned to embrace those imperfections. They're what make my work unique and personal. They show the human element of art, the beauty in the struggle. Creating art in a messy studio has also taught me about the value of experimentation. When you're surrounded by chaos, it's easy to get lost in the process of trying new things. I'll often start with a clear idea of what I want to create, but as I work, I'll find myself taking detours and trying new techniques. Some of these experiments fail, but others lead to unexpected breakthroughs. The messy studio experience has taught me not to fear failure, but to embrace it as part of the creative process. Perhaps the most significant lesson I've learned from my messy art studio experience is that art is not just about the final product; it's about the journey. When I look back on my paintings and drawings, I'm often struck by how different they are from what I had envisioned at the beginning. But that's the beauty of art. It's a journey of discovery, an exploration of self-expression. The messy art studio experience has taught me to enjoy the process of creation, to let go of my expectations and embrace the unexpected. In conclusion, the messy art studio experience is an essential part of what makes art so magical to me. It's a reminder of the power of imperfection, the value of experimentation, and the joy of the creative journey. When I'm in the studio surrounded by chaos, I feel free to let go of my fears and insecurities and immerse myself in the creative process. The mess around me is a comforting reminder that anything is possible when it comes to art, that there's beauty in the struggle, and that imperfection is something to embrace rather than fear. The studio is a sanctuary for me, a place of creativity and inspiration where I can be my most authentic self. And for that, I'm eternally grateful.",0,2.347455832,2.564206687,2.740884154,2.956721553,2.643311444,10.2,14.4,17.0,20.0,15.5
C1,571,"The art studio was the first place in high school where I felt at home. As a freshman, I had no idea what to expect when I walked into the studio on my very first day. However, as soon as I put my hands on the paintbrush, I knew that I had discovered something that I would always cherish. The white walls of the art studio transformed into a magical place where I could draw, paint, and create without any fear. This space allowed me to explore and push boundaries that went beyond the canvas. Art helped me discover who I was and what I stood for. By creating art, I could express my feelings and emotions without words. I found that I could use vibrant colors to capture my aches and pains, my fears, and my dreams. The art studio allowed me to take a step back from the chaos of the world and focus on what was within me. Art was no longer just an activity. It became a way of life. The art studio has a unique and special environment that I have yet to find in other places. The atmosphere was always open and welcoming, and the people always seemed to glow. The art studio provided a sense of community that felt like home. It was an escape from the daily routine, a safe haven where I felt safer than anywhere else. The art studio taught me important lessons that went far beyond the formal curriculum. I learned the value of patience and persistence when I attempted to create intricate designs or detailed sketches. Every line had to be perfect, every stroke had to be in the right place. It taught me to appreciate the beauty that came with labor and hard work. Moreover, the art studio allowed me to connect with others in a way that I never thought was possible. It gave me the space to collaborate side-by-side with my fellow artists. Everyone had a voice, and it was their job to make it heard. In the art studio, there were no wrong answers, no correct ways of doing things. It was a space that allowed for creativity to flourish, and that encouraged everyone to bring their unique perspectives to the table. Despite the current educational system that doesn't recognize the value of art education, the art studio remains a vital lifeline that has sustained me. The skills I learned while creating art will benefit me in all areas of my life. For instance, I can speak up and connect with people in a way that wasn't possible before. In addition to that, the art studio allowed me to find my passion for art, and I now know it's my calling. In conclusion, the art studio will always be a special place for me, a haven where I found myself, learned important life skills, and connected with others. Everyone deserves the chance to experience what I felt in the art studio, and I believe it should be an integral part of every school's curriculum. We must teach future generations of students the value of art, the importance of creativity, and the power of self-expression. In doing so, we can create a world that is more colorful, more vibrant, and more human.",0,2.446773063,2.683036725,2.767238755,3.019616271,2.734811428,13.2,15.0,18.0,22.0,17.0
C2,572,"The sun is just beginning to rise as I make my way to my art studio, my trusty backpack slung over my shoulder. I can feel the cool morning air on my skin, and I can smell the scent of freshly cut grass as I make my way across the dewy lawn. As I approach the door, I can hear the sound of birds chirping in the nearby trees, and I'm filled with a sense of excitement and anticipation. My studio is a small space, just big enough for a desk, an easel, and a few shelves of art supplies. But for me, it's a sanctuary, a space where I can escape from the outside world and focus on my creativity. As I open the door, I'm hit with the scent of paint and turpentine, and I can feel the rough texture of the wooden floorboards under my feet. I sit down at my desk and begin to rummage through my backpack, pulling out my latest project: a canvas filled with bold streaks of color and dramatic brushstrokes. As I begin to work, I'm struck by a sense of freedom and experimentation. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to art, and every stroke of the brush feels like a small act of rebellion against the rules and expectations of the outside world. But as I work, I begin to notice the chaos around me. Paint is splattered on the walls and the floor, my brushes are scattered haphazardly on my desk, and there are crumpled up pieces of paper littering the ground. In some ways, my messy art studio is a reflection of my own approach to creativity. I don't believe in perfection or order; instead, I embrace the mess, the chaos, and the imperfection of the creative journey. Over the years, I've learned that this messy approach to art is both freeing and empowering. When I'm working on a project, I don't worry about making mistakes or following strict guidelines. Instead, I let my intuition guide me, trusting that the creative process will lead me to something beautiful and worthwhile. But this approach isn't just limited to the world of art. I believe that messy creativity is a mindset that can be applied to every aspect of life. It's about unlearning the strict rules and expectations that we've been taught, and instead trusting our own instincts and desires. It's about taking risks, making mistakes, and learning from them. As I look towards my future, I know that my messy art studio experience will continue to shape my approach to the world. I want to go to college not just to earn a degree, but to surround myself with other like-minded individuals who value experimentation, imperfection, and self-expression. I want to be a part of a community that values messy creativity, and that is unafraid to try new things and to make mistakes. In many ways, I see college as a metaphorical art studio. It's a space where students are encouraged to experiment and explore, to take risks and to learn from failure. And just as my art studio has been a sanctuary for my own creativity, I want college to be a sanctuary where I can continue to grow and develop as both an artist and a person. In conclusion, my messy art studio experience is part of what makes me unique and sets me apart as a college applicant. It's taught me valuable lessons about imperfection, experimentation, and the beauty of the creative journey. I'm excited to bring these values with me to college and to continue exploring the messy, chaotic world of creativity. Whether I'm painting, writing, or creating in some other medium, I know that my messy art studio experience will be a guiding force in my future pursuits.",0,2.647284283,2.903947043,2.990259925,3.362536129,2.939604351,15.8,20.0,22.4,27.2,21.0
H,573,"The man was a prodigy. He had performed for American presidents and even the Queen of England, every moment documented with autographed photos hanging in his guest bathroom. Even with a stature of 5 feet and change, his presence towered above me unforgivingly. His skeptical eye stared down at me as I struggled to balance my mom’s iPhone on its makeshift tripod. A month earlier, the Pasadena Symphony-Pops had commissioned me to create a video featuring its debuting conductor, Michael Feinstein. Now, the five-time Grammy nominee hunkered down on his piano bench, impatiently waiting for my command. With no professional equipment and little preparation beforehand, I had thrown together whatever I could find. A day before, I had taken pliers to bend a coat-hanger into a holder for the purple-cased iPhone 4. I even used a block of Post-Its to prop up a second-hand GoPro for another camera angle. Fumbling about, I felt like a child looking desperately for direction, almost expecting an adult to hand me a checklist—complete with the right questions to ask, directions to give, and instructions to complete. But I was on my own now. My “wing-it” approach to the shoot quickly became obvious, and Feinstein’s skeptical reception grew into condescension as I stumbled painfully through the interview. The filming ended, and heavy doors swung shut behind the mansion as I was escorted out. I had blown it. Academic rubrics and guidelines were straightforward—but here, being a straight-A student in the classroom held little value. For the first time, the Feinstein project had given me the opportunity to conduct my own show—but I had arrived without a baton. The MacGyver camera rigging wasn’t the flaw; in fact, I think I pulled off the creative contraption decently well considering my lack of better resources. The real failure was my complete lack of preparation and absence of confident leadership. Yes, it would’ve been easy to write off Feinstein as arrogant—he certainly didn’t serve me a generous helping of grace. He had envisioned a director with a camera crew—I was a 16-year-old amateur with my mom’s iPhone. But looking back, I realized that Feinstein had given me a valuable gift: expecting more from me than what I expected from myself. Did I want to just be the teenager with a camera phone? The interview with Feinstein was humiliating, but the experience forced me to decide if I wanted to be that director with his own camera crew. I took action. As part of the commission, I had already negotiated for the PSA to pay for professional editing software, Final Cut Pro X and Motion 5. I had a vision of what I wanted, but I also had no idea how to use these programs to get there—I was just an amateur with no film experience beyond the occasional school project with iMovie. I dove head-first into editing, determined to not let my inexperience stop me. The process was brutal—I spent countless hours reading online manuals to solve frequent problems. But every frustration fueled determination. Over the course of 80 working hours, the video progressed from a barebones slideshow of images to a multi-faceted film with customized titles and transition animations. The completed production, though far from a masterpiece, gave me a sense of accomplishment knowing that my initial failure propelled me to work beyond my expectations and fulfill my own vision. I was ready. Stepping back one last time to watch the finished video with my Pasadena Symphony-Pops clients, I no longer felt like the lost boy in the Feinstein mansion. And amidst the excitement and congratulations around me, I wished Michael would have been there too—to thank him for helping me set aside the iPhone and coat hanger, take the baton, and conduct my own show.",1,2.563696353,2.988672839,3.349239051,3.621638796,3.152395734,12.6,16.2,19.8,25.0,18.0
C0,574,"It was the interview that I had been waiting for. The company was one of the top performers in its industry, and the position was everything I had been dreaming of - a chance to work in a dynamic and fast-paced environment that had the potential to impact the world. I had spent weeks preparing for this interview, reading up on industry trends, refreshing my knowledge on key concepts, and going through every possible question. Yet, when it came to the actual interview, I bombed. I was so nervous that I stumbled on my words, fumbled with my answers, and couldn't bring myself to look the interviewer in the eye. I knew I had messed up even before I left the building, and the rejection letter that arrived a few days later was hardly a surprise. At first, I was devastated. I had pinned all my hopes on this opportunity and had now blown it. I was angry with myself for not doing better, for not being more assertive, and for not being able to rise to the occasion. But eventually, as the disappointment started to fade, I realized that there was much to be learned from my failed interview. In fact, it turned out to be one of the most valuable experiences of my life. Here's why: First and foremost, it forced me to confront my weaknesses. Until that point, I had always been a high achiever - someone who excelled at academics, sports, and extracurriculars without too much effort. But in the real world, that simply wasn't enough. I had to learn how to market myself, how to communicate my value proposition, and how to negotiate in a high-pressure environment. By failing my interview, I was shown a mirror to my weaknesses and given an opportunity to work on them. Secondly, it taught me the importance of preparation. I had thought I was ready for the interview - I had researched the company, read up on their values, and rehearsed my answers. But in reality, I hadn't done enough. I hadn't practiced enough with a real person, nor had I done any mock interviews to see where I was lacking. I hadn't kept in mind the fundamentals of communication, such as eye contact and a steady tone. Failing the interview was a stark reminder that preparation never really ends, that there is always more to learn and more work to do. Thirdly, it helped me develop resilience. At first, I wanted to give up completely after getting that rejection letter. But then I realized that failure was part of the journey. Everyone fails at some point; the key was to bounce back from that failure and not let it define me. I reassessed my goals and went back to the drawing board, starting from scratch and building myself up again with the lessons learned. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, it opened up completely new doors for me. Prior to my failed interview, I had been so fixated on this particular company that I had closed myself off to other opportunities. But when that door closed, I forced myself to open up to other options, and in doing so, I found an industry that was even more aligned with my passions and interests. It was an industry that I had never even considered before failing my interview, and yet, it has given me some of the most rewarding experiences and a career I am genuinely excited to pursue. Overall, my failed interview taught me the power of being vulnerable, the importance of hustle, the value of resilience, and the beauty of serendipity. I learned that it was okay to fail, and in fact, it was often necessary for growth. That experience changed the way I approached job interviews, networking, and life in general. It taught me to aim high but also to be humble, to put in the work but also to embrace the unknown, and to always be open to new experiences, perspectives, and lessons. As I prepare to apply to colleges and universities, I know that my failed interview is one story that I'll always keep close. It embodies the spirit of growth and transformation that I hope to bring to my next academic journey. I am ready for whatever challenges come my way, even if they are failures, because I know that every failure comes with its own set of opportunities for growth and learning.

C1,575,"Leadership is often thought of as a buzzword, something that’s easy to throw around in college applications or job interviews. But for me, leadership was a skill that had to be earned the hard way, through failure, reflection and self-improvement. As I sat across from the woman at the charity organization, I felt a sense of responsibility settling on my shoulders. I had been tasked with organizing a charity fundraiser for the organization, something that was new territory for me. The woman, a seasoned veteran of the charity circuit, was skeptical. 'Are you sure you can handle this?' she asked, eyeing me up and down. I don't blame her for her hesitation. I was just a high school senior, someone with no previous experience in fundraising or event planning. But I was determined to prove her wrong. Over the next few months, I worked tirelessly to make the fundraiser happen. I recruited volunteers, called up local businesses for sponsorships, and promoted the event on social media. There were moments when I doubted myself, when I wondered if I had taken on too much. But I pushed through, knowing that failure wasn't an option. On the day of the event, I arrived early, setting up tables, arranging decorations and coordinating with volunteers. The fundraiser was a success, raising thousands of dollars for the organization, and I felt a sense of pride wash over me as I watched people dance and celebrate. Looking back on that experience, I realized that leadership isn't just about being in charge or making decisions. It's about being able to step outside of your comfort zone and take chances, to believe in yourself even when others doubt you. It's about being able to communicate effectively, delegate tasks, and collaborate with others towards a common goal. As I began to apply to colleges like Yale and Harvard, I realized that leadership was a central theme of my application, something that I had developed through years of trial and error. My experiences in group projects, debate, and community service had all taught me the importance of being a strong, confident leader, someone who could inspire others to do their best. But I also recognized that my leadership skills were far from perfect, that there was always room for improvement. I looked forward to the opportunities that college would bring, the chance to work with talented peers, collaborate on projects, and learn from mentors who were at the top of their fields. But more than that, I was excited about the chance to make an impact, to use my skills and abilities to contribute to a better world. Whether it was through research, community service, or social entrepreneurship, I knew that the skills I had developed over the years would be crucial in helping me make a difference. Leadership is a journey, one that's full of twists and turns, setbacks and successes. But through it all, I've learned that being a leader isn't about being perfect, it's about having the courage to try, to fail, and to learn from your mistakes. It's about staying true to your values and using your skills to make the world a better place. As I approach my college years, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead, the chance to explore new subjects, meet new people, and grow as a person.

C2,576,"The sound of my heartbeat pounded through my chest as I walked into the dimly lit charity office. The faintly musty smell of stale air and paper mixed with the heady aroma of rich coffee. A woman with sharp green eyes peered out from behind a stack of papers on her desk. She looked me up and down, sizing me up as I explained the fundraiser I wanted to organize. The biggest challenge was standing out among the many other charity events clamoring for attention. I researched the market, looking for an angle that set us apart. After hours of searching, I found it: a big-name musician was scheduled to perform in the area soon, and I got him to agree to a short appearance at our event. The day of the fundraiser, I arrived early to set up. The room was awash with a sea of color, tables decked out with decorations, from the origami centerpieces to the streamers laced around the walls. The chatter of the volunteers echoed throughout the room, their laughter making the walls dance. There were moments when I worried that the fundraiser would fail, but I pushed through. As the event progressed, the thumping beats of music resonated through the walls as dancing and laughter filled the space. Everyone was having a great time, and as we tallied the donations at the end of the night, we raised more money than we had anticipated. This experience showed me that leadership is not just about talking, but about doing. In organizing the fundraiser, I learned to work with others, to listen and allow them to share their ideas. I was able to communicate the mission of the charity better and motivate people to work harder towards achieving the goal. The lessons that I’ve learned through fundraising have translated into other parts of my life. In debate club, I practiced articulating my opinions clearly and used my skills in a team setting. I have honed my skills through community service projects, working with people in challenging situations and learning to empathize with them. Being a good leader takes patience and fortitude. I have learned that change does not come overnight, and that success comes from consistent effort, deliberation, and dedication. Failing does not imply weakness- it confirms that one is trying their best to go beyond their limits. As I approach my college years, I am excited about the opportunity to develop my leadership skills even further. Collaboration with my accomplished peers gives a chance to gain new perspectives, learning from their distinct styles of leadership. I also look forward to engaging in research projects that will allow me to use my creativity and problem-solving skills to positively impact the world. In sum, fostering leadership is not just about being in charge or making decisions. More than anything, it’s about working with others, communicating openly and honestly, and compelling people to work towards the common good. It is about being consistently aware of one’s imperfection and continuously working to better oneself. Through my experiences building leadership skills, I am confident that I possess the qualities that both Yale and Harvard look for in a student. I am prepared to undertake their rigorous curriculums, project assignments, campus campaigns, and community outreaches with great dedication, discipline, and creativity. Being a college student is an opportunity to take positive steps in the direction of personal growth and the betterment of the world.

H,577,"The summer after my freshman year, I found myself in an old classroom holding a blue dry erase-marker, realizing what should have been obvious: I had no idea how to be a teacher. As an active speech and debate competitor, I was chosen as a volunteer instructor for an elementary public speaking camp hosted by my high school. For the first time, I would have the opportunity to experience the classroom from the other side of the teacher’s desk. My responsibility was simple: in two weeks, take sixteen fifth graders and turn them into confident, persuasive speakers. I walked into class the first morning, enthusiastically looking forward to the opportunity to share my knowledge, experiences, and stories. I was hoping for motivated kids, eager to learn, attentive to my every word. Instead, I got Spencer, who thought class was a good time to train his basketball skills by tossing crumpled speeches into the trash can from afar. I got Monica, who refused to speak, and I got James, who didn’t understand the difference between “voice projection” and “screaming.” I got London, who enjoyed doodling on her desk with permanent marker, and I got Arnav, who thought I wouldn’t notice him playing Angry Birds all day. The only questions I got were “When’s lunch break?” and “Why are you giving us homework?” and the only time I got my students to raise their hands was when I asked “How many of you are only here because your parents forced you to?” Just ten minutes into class, two things hit me: Spencer’s crumpled paper ball, and the realization that teaching was hard. When I was younger, I thought that a good teacher was one that gave high-fives after class. Later, of course, I knew it was far more complicated than that. I thought about teachers I admired and their memorable qualities. They were knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and inspiring. Their classes were always fun, and they always taught me something. There was plenty I wanted to teach, from metaphors to logical fallacies. But most importantly, I wanted my students to enjoy public speaking, to love giving speeches as much as I did. And that’s when I realized the most important quality of my favorite teachers: passion. They loved their subject and passed that love on to their students. While it wouldn’t be easy, I wanted to do the same. Every day for two weeks, I searched for creative ways to inspire and teach my students. I helped London speak on her love for art; I had Arnav debate about cell phone policies in schools. And by the end of the camp, I realized that my sixteen students all saw me not as a high school student, but as a teacher. I took their questions, shared my enthusiasm, and by the time camp was over, they weren’t just learning, but enjoying learning. I was on the other side of the teacher’s desk, but I hadn’t stopped learning. Each day, I was learning how to communicate more effectively, how to deal with new challenges and circumstances, and how to be a better teacher. I once thought that being an adult meant knowing all the answers. But in reality, adults, even teachers, constantly have more to learn. I made the transition away from being a child during those weeks, but I did not and would not transition away from being a learner. When class ended each afternoon, I would cap my blue dry-erase marker, give high-fives to the students as they walked out the door, and watch as their parents picked them up. I was confident that when my students were asked the inevitable questions of “Did you learn something today?” and “Did you have fun?” their answers would be a resounding yes. And even as their teacher, I learned and had fun too.",1,2.271265636,2.643028363,2.950008285,3.200457282,2.799898476,12.0,15.0,20.0,26.0,18.0
C0,578,"As I entered high school, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. But as I went through each day, I noticed that the happiness and fulfillment I felt came from being in the classroom. It wasn't until then that I realized that I wanted to become a teacher. I believe that teaching requires both passion and patience. Without these two fundamental qualities, one cannot be a successful educator. First and foremost, passion is crucial in teaching. Passion is what drives educators to wake up every day and leave an impact on their students. Passion is what keeps them going, even when the going gets tough. I can sincerely say that I am passionate about teaching. My passion for teaching isn't solely derived from a love of the subject itself or a desire to impart knowledge on others. Instead, it is an innate desire to make a difference in someone's life. I believe that education is the foundation for success, and I want to be a catalyst for that change. In class, I try my best to incorporate passion into my teaching. I try to make my students as enthusiastic about the material as I am. I believe that if I am not passionate about what I am teaching, how can I expect my students to be? Patience is another quality that is essential in teaching. Patience is the ability to remain calm and composed, even in the most trying of situations. As a teacher, one must possess patience as students learn in many different ways at varying paces. Patience is something that I have had to learn over time. One of my first experiences teaching was as a volunteer at an elementary school. I was assigned to a first-grade class, and I was excited to start. I quickly realized that the first-graders' attention spans were much shorter than I anticipated, and their behavior was a little more challenging to manage. There were times when I wanted to give up, but I didn't. I learned to be patient with them, to understand where they were coming from, and to help them learn in a way that worked for them. Especially in recent days, patience has become more important now more than ever. In the era of virtual learning, students are struggling with technology and internet connectivity issues. Teachers have had to adapt to these problems and had to find new and exciting ways to engage students even through the screens. Another significant challenge that has existed in recent years is the mainstreaming of students with disabilities in the classroom. Teachers are now held accountable for ensuring that these students receive the best education possible. patience plays a significant role in ensuring that students with disabilities are not left behind. Teaching isn't easy. It requires a great deal of work, dedication, and sacrifice. Teachers must not only be passionate and patient but be willing to devote their lives to the profession. In addition, the teacher must be ready to change, adapt, and improvise constantly. As a future educator, I am excited to embark on this journey. I understand that it won't always be smooth sailing, but I am willing to put in the work to become the best teacher that I can be. I want to inspire my students and empower them to reach their full potential. I want to be a positive force in their lives and help shape them into successful individuals. I plan to cultivate my passion for teaching and use it as a beacon of light for my students. I believe that if I love what I'm doing, my students will be inspired to love it too. Beyond that, I want to promote patience and empathy in the classroom. I hope to be a teacher who can put themselves into their student's shoes and help them succeed. In conclusion, teaching requires passion and patience. As a future educator, I believe that I possess these qualities and that I can use them to inspire and empower my students. I want to make a difference in the world, and I believe that teaching is the path that will lead me there. Finally, just like the African proverb 'If you want to go quickly, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together,' I know that I won’t be able to reach my full potential as a teacher without my students, who will come from diverse backgrounds and experience different challenges. But with passion, patience, and understanding, we can make our collective journey a successful one.",0,2.352100933,2.510169776,2.698383372,2.894283357,2.638538359,12.0,14.0,17.0,20.6,15.0
C1,579,"As a high school senior with a passion for teaching, I can relate to the experiences of the author. Despite being a speech and debate competitor, I quickly discovered that teaching is not an easy job. The realization that being an effective teacher requires more than just subject matter knowledge came to me during my summer break when I volunteered to teach children in my community. This experience further deepened my passion for teaching, and I dedicated myself to acquiring the skills I needed not only to be a good teacher but a great one. One lesson that I have learned is the importance of empathy. In my experience, empathy helps build rapport with students and creates a safe learning environment. For example, I had one student who was struggling with anxiety, which affected their ability to concentrate. Instead of pressuring them to ‘snap out of it’, I realized that being patient and listening attentively went a long way in building trust. I made it a point to check on them at the start and end of each class – a small gesture that made all the difference in their learning experience. Another important aspect of teaching is patience. Not just with the students, but with the challenges that come with teaching. I learned this the hard way during a lesson on geometry. Trying to keep the students engaged, I introduced different activities but still nothing seemed to work. The students were not getting it, and I was getting frustrated. However, instead of giving up, I took a step back, reevaluated my approach, and tried a different angle. I broke down the concept into visual segments, making it easier to comprehend. It was not an overnight change, but the incremental progress was apparent, and in the end, the students had a better grasp of the concept. The creative side of teaching has also been a revelation. A lesson can have the same content, but presented differently can leave a lasting impact on students. I found that the more creative I was with lesson plans – using games, interactive activities, and real-life situations – the more the students were engaged and the more they enjoyed the learning experience. There is no one-size-fits-all approach in teaching and exploring multiple avenues in delivering content is often necessary. Perhaps the most important lesson that I have learned about being a teacher is the importance of being a learner. There will always be new teaching methods, new students with different needs, and new challenges to overcome. Teachers must be able to evolve, learn and adapt. This means being open-minded, accepting constructive feedback, and seeking out opportunities for professional development. It is not just the students who gain knowledge from teaching; teachers too are continuously learning, creating a circle of growth and development. In conclusion, we must not take for granted the complexities and importance of teaching. It goes beyond imparting knowledge, it’s about nurturing young minds to be lifelong learners. A teacher must possess a mixture of empathy, patience, creativity, and a willingness to grow. As I prepare for my college education, I aspire to become a teacher who cares, inspires, and empowers young minds. There is no greater reward in life than seeing a student overcome a challenge they once thought impossible, and knowing that you had a part in it. I remain dedicated to acquiring the skills necessary to become a great teacher, knowing that it is a continuous journey of learning and growth. It is a privilege to have the ability to make an impact in the lives of students, and I am grateful for the opportunity to do so.",0,2.571088104,2.713061635,2.900186177,3.077374747,2.872580514,13.0,15.8,18.2,24.6,17.0
C2,580,"As a high school senior, I have been fortunate enough to experience the magic of teaching. I have come to appreciate the importance of empathy and patience in creating a safe and enjoyable learning environment. However, it wasn't until I volunteered to teach children in my community that I realized that teaching is more than just subject matter knowledge. It requires creativity, imagination, and a willingness to learn. I remember clearly the sun-drenched afternoon when I first stepped into the classroom. The room was filled with the chatter of children with eyes wide open, eagerly waiting for the start of the day's lessons. The smell of sharpened pencils, neatly stacked books, and crayons made the room feel alive. The energy in the room was electric. To be honest, I was a bit nervous, but I gave myself a pep talk, grabbed my teaching materials, and began teaching. My first lesson was a complete disaster. I was using traditional teaching methods that proved ineffective. The children weren't paying attention, and I couldn't connect with them. It was then that I realized that I needed to reinvent my teaching style. I remembered that one of my favorite teachers from the past used to incorporate games in his lessons. So, I decided to try something similar. I began to use colorful dice, interactive activities, and real-life situations to engage the children. It wasn't long before the children were laughing, having fun, and, most importantly, learning. The colors of the classroom became more vibrant, and the noise level turned into focused concentration. I noticed that the children's progress improved, and the atmosphere in the room changed dramatically. I realized that creativity plays an important role in making content easy to understand and, more importantly, enjoyable. However, there was one little boy in my class who struggled. Despite my best efforts, he was far behind the rest of the class. He struggled to comprehend, and his self-esteem was taking a hit. I could sense that he was starting to feel left out, and I felt the need to reach out to him. It was then that I realized that empathy could be a powerful tool in teaching. I dedicated more time to him and discovered that he had a hidden talent for the arts. I started incorporating art into my lesson plans, and he blossomed. The dull grey classroom walls turned into colorful canvases, covered with different strokes of paint. The boy's eyes lit up every time he finished a piece of art, and he became more confident in his abilities. He was thriving, and it was all thanks to a little bit of empathy and a creative approach. Another important aspect of teaching that I have learned is the importance of patience. There is a famous quote that says, 'patience is a virtue,' and nowhere does this apply more than in teaching. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, your students may not comprehend the material immediately. It can be frustrating, but as a teacher, you must have the patience to work with them until they get it. I had a student who had a hard time grasping the intricacies of algebra. The more I tried to help, the more frustrated he became. It was then that I realized that I needed to adjust my approach. I broke down the concepts into simple terms, being mindful of his struggles and taking the time needed to understand his thought processes. I used real-life examples that he could easily relate to, like his favorite sports team's performance. It wasn't long before the student grasped the concepts, and his confidence grew. He gained a newfound appreciation for the subject and even received an 'A' on his next test. I realized then that patience, coupled with creativity, can be used to make complex subjects easier for students to comprehend. As I prepare for my college education, I look forward to honing my teaching skills even further. I am committed to becoming not just a teacher, but a great teacher. I am excited to learn different approaches, experiment with new teaching methods, and continuously improve. I am excited by the possibility to inspire, to create a safe learning environment, and most importantly, to make a positive impact on young minds. In conclusion, the journey towards becoming a great teacher is a lifelong one, and I intend to devote myself to it fully. There is nothing more fulfilling than seeing the progress that a student makes when they have an engaged and patient teacher. As the sun sets on my high school days, I am motivated by the thought of inspiring a new generation of learners to be compassionate, creative, and dynamic. I look forward to the challenges that lay ahead and the lessons that come with it. One thing is for sure, I am excited to see what the future holds.",0,2.444139488,2.596803998,2.803063505,2.949632113,2.739868025,13.0,14.0,16.0,21.0,15.0
H,581,"What is love? A promise at the altar? The soft kiss of water on parched lips? A flash of his shadowed gray eyes, or the tender caress of pink pigment on her cheekbones? “I love those Jimmy Choos!” “I just love the pasta salad at La Madeleine.” “Love you!” “Love ya more!” Love. For a word describing such a powerful emotion, it is always in the air. The word “love” has become so pervasive in everyday conversation that it hardly retains its roots in blazing passion and deep adoration. In fact, the word is thrown about so much that it becomes difficult to believe society isn’t just one huge, smitten party, with everyone holding hands and singing “Kumbaya.” In films, it’s the teenage boy’s grudging response to a doting mother. At school, it’s a habitual farewell between friends. But in my Chinese home, it’s never uttered. Watching my grandmother lie unconscious on the hospital bed, waiting for her body to shut down, was excruciatingly painful. Her final quavering breaths formed a discordant rhythm with the steady beep of hospital equipment and the unsympathetic, tapping hands of the clock. That evening, I whispered—into unhearing ears—the first, and only, “I love you” I ever said to her, my rankling guilt haunting me relentlessly for weeks after her passing. My warm confession seemed anticlimactic, met with only the coldness of my surroundings—the blank room, impassive doctors, and empty silence. I struggled to understand why the “love” that so easily rolled off my tongue when bantering with friends dissipated from my vocabulary when I spoke to my family. Do Chinese people simply love less than Americans do? As I look back on seventeen years growing up in my Chinese family, I don’t feel a gaping hole where “love” should be. I see my grandmother with her fluff of white hair, guiding my clumsy fingers as they grip the Chinese calligraphy brush, carefully dip just enough ink onto its thick bristles, and slowly smooth the pigment over tan parchment to form wobbly Chinese characters. I taste the sweet watermelon brought to my room at 3 a.m. during finals week by a worried mother, and I hear the booming voice of my father begging me to get more sleep. I envision baba, dad, waiting in the 100 ℉ heat every day to pick me up from school, just to drive home in traffic-infested roads. My mama, mother, staying home from work to care for my cold, then feeling no resentment when she contracted it herself. My mistakes yielded stern, harsh lectures brimming with concern, while my tears assuaged mama’s irritation. I picture that arcane emotion imprinted in tacit smiles and hidden tears—shining from chests and unabashed pride. Within the realm of my memories, I discovered a truth that lessened my crushing regret at the loss of my grandmother: just because Chinese love, ai, can never render a fondness for Britney Spears’ Toxic or be prostituted to mold description of delicious dishes, the emotion isn’t any more absent, or any less profound. Knowing that I could possibly have shared with my grandmother an implicit love that neither of us chose to address vocally, I could loosen my selfish grip on her past and allow her to ascend into her future. Although the alien expression “wo ai ni, mama, baba,” would be met with a few awkward blinks and a “How much money do you need?” expression, I feel the fondness of my joking father like “[g]reat drums throbbing through the air [,]” and for my stern mother in “great pulsing tides[,]” as Countee Cullen articulates in Heritage. We Chinese aren’t limited by the cultural and linguistic “love” barrier; we learn, through living together as a family, through our shared experiences, the sensation of true devotion and compassion, and, if that’s not something Americans call love, then I don’t know what “love” is.",1,2.28563865,3.037145999,3.223916027,3.429090087,3.110211341,10.0,19.4,23.0,37.2,21.0
C0,582,"Growing up in a Chinese household, I was always surrounded by stories of love that were vastly different from the ones I saw on television or in literature. In Chinese culture, the concept of love is rooted in family, community, and selflessness, rather than just romantic relationships. It wasn't until I delved deeper into my heritage that I began to understand the unique take on love that Chinese culture offered. In traditional Chinese culture, love is seen as a duty, rather than a mere feeling. The idea of love was closely tied to filial piety, or showing respect and obedience to one's parents and elders. This meant that a significant portion of what it meant to love someone was showing them respect and being obedient to their wishes. This form of love was not just reserved for family, but also extended to the larger community. People were expected to love their neighbors and fellow citizens just as they loved their families, and this meant doing what was best for the community, even if it meant sacrificing individual desires. One of the ways this love manifests is in the Chinese concept of 'guanxi,' which is loosely translated to 'connections' or 'relationships.' Guanxi is the idea that a person's success or failure is largely dependent on the quality of their relationships with others. This can include friends, family, and even acquaintances. Building and maintaining good guanxi requires selflessness and a willingness to help others without expecting anything in return. In essence, it is an extension of the love and duty that one feels towards their family and community. Another way that love is expressed in Chinese culture is through the concept of 'ren,' which translates to 'humanity.' This idea emphasizes the importance of treating others with kindness and compassion, with a focus on mutual respect and harmony. It is believed that through the practice of ren, one can cultivate a sense of love and understanding for all human beings, rather than just those within their immediate circle. The end goal is to create a society that is egalitarian and cooperative, based on mutual respect and benevolence. These concepts of love and duty are exemplified in one of the most cherished Chinese holidays, the Lunar New Year. This holiday is a time for families to come together, exchange gifts, and enjoy elaborate feasts. It is also a time for reflection and gratitude, as families pay their respects to their ancestors and express thanks for the good fortune of the past year. The Lunar New Year is a celebration of love and community, where people put aside their personal desires and come together to honor those around them. Despite the importance of duty and community in Chinese culture, there is still room for romantic love. However, the concept of love is still intertwined with the idea of sacrifice and putting others before oneself. For example, in Chinese weddings, the bride and groom typically serve tea to their parents and elderly relatives as a sign of respect and acknowledgement for all that they have done. It is a symbol of the sacrifice that both the bride and groom have made, leaving behind their own families to create a new one. As I have grown older and grappled with what love means to me, I have come to appreciate the unique take on love that Chinese culture offers. It has taught me the importance of community and sacrifice, and has helped me cultivate a sense of gratitude for the people in my life. I have learned that love is not just a feeling, but a practice that requires patience, understanding, and a willingness to put others first. In conclusion, the Chinese concept of love offers a distinctive perspective that is rooted in duty, community, and selflessness. It is a reminder that love is not just reserved for romantic relationships, but that it extends to all facets of life. By embracing these values, we can create a society that is grounded in mutual respect, harmony, and benevolence. And in doing so, we can build a world that is rooted in love, rather than fear or division.",0,2.785528096,2.912838813,3.083393718,3.250403566,3.000062381,18.0,19.0,22.0,25.8,20.0
C1,583,"What is love? Is it a universal language that transcends race, culture, and language? Or is it a word so ubiquitous that it has lost its substance? I have always been fascinated by the idea of love beyond borders and boundaries, but it wasn't until I met N, my Korean significant other, that I began to understand its true meaning. Growing up in a homogenous community, I was unaware of the uniqueness of other cultures, and it wasn't until later in life that I was introduced to different languages, customs, and traditions. When I met N, I was immediately struck by his charm, even though our communication methods were limited to Google Translate, gestures, and a few broken phrases. In the beginning, our cultural and linguistic differences created a few barriers to communication, but we found creative ways to connect with each other. We learned from the nuances of each other's languages, laughed at each other's mistakes, and used the internet to translate what we couldn't understand. Through our conversations, I gained an appreciation for Korean culture and its traditions, and I began to understand N's perspective on the world. As our relationship became more serious, I decided to take further steps to learn more. I watched Korean dramas, listened to K-pop, and even tried my hand at cooking Korean food. I also introduced N to popular American TV shows and the quirks of Western culture. In doing so, we shared our experiences with each other and began to appreciate each other more deeply. What I discovered was that love beyond borders and boundaries is not about ignoring the differences between cultures; it's about embracing them. Instead of trying to change or erase our cultural identities, N and I learned to respect and appreciate our mutual differences. We became more open-minded and tolerant of each other's experiences and found a middle ground where our customs intersected. Through N, I met friends from different parts of the world, each with their unique backgrounds and perspectives. I also began to understand the complexities of cross-cultural relationships, including misunderstandings and challenges. But I also saw how these differences can create strength, resilience, and understanding. Today, I am an advocate for cross-cultural relationships and the benefits they can bring. I volunteer for organizations that promote cultural exchange and assist immigrant populations. I believe that respect for diversity and an openness to new experiences are key to a life rich in meaning and purpose. In conclusion, love beyond borders and boundaries is about more than just falling in love with someone from a different culture. It's an attitude that requires a willingness to learn, tolerance, and appreciation for the differences that make us unique. It's about understanding and respecting the customs, languages, and traditions that shape us without erasing them. And it's about building bridges instead of walls. Through my experiences, I have learned that love beyond borders and boundaries is not only possible, but it can be a transformative experience that enhances our lives in ways we never imagined. My relationship with N has taught me to embrace uniqueness and diversity, and I hope to inspire others to do the same.",0,2.527899541,2.875360761,2.983930604,3.210210223,2.897809545,13.4,16.0,21.0,23.6,18.5
C2,584,"I still remember the first time I met N. It was a humid summer day, and there was a light breeze blowing through the trees. I was sitting in a coffee shop with some friends, chatting and sipping on my latte. I heard a cheerful voice say, 'Excuse me, do you know where the bathroom is?' I looked up and locked eyes with a handsome Asian man. At first, I wasn't sure if he was talking to me, but I smiled and gestured towards the back of the cafe. He thanked me, and we went back to our respective conversations. A few minutes later, he came back to my table and attempted to strike up a conversation. The problem was, he didn't speak a word of English, and I didn't speak a word of Korean. We laughed awkwardly and exchanged some hand gestures, but we both knew it was a futile attempt. We parted ways that day, but something about him stuck with me. The way his smile lit up his entire face, the gentle curve of his jawline, and the way he seemed so determined to communicate with me, even though we didn't share a common language. Over the next few days, I couldn't stop thinking about him. I didn't even know his name, but I felt drawn to him. I asked around and learned that his name was N, and he was a Korean exchange student studying at a local college. I couldn't get him out of my mind. So, I did the only logical thing: I downloaded Google Translate and started learning some basic Korean phrases. I never thought I'd use the app for anything serious, but I was desperate to communicate with N. The next time I saw him, he was sitting in the same coffee shop. I mustered up the courage and walked over to his table, armed with my phone and the basic Korean phrases I'd memorized. The look on his face when he realized I was trying to speak to him in Korean was priceless. He laughed and shook his head, but he was also touched by my effort. And that was the start of our unconventional romance. Over the next few months, N and I communicated using a combination of hand gestures, Google Translate, and facial expressions. We would meet at the same coffee shop, practice our respective languages, and exchange stories about our cultures. Despite the language barrier, our connection continued to grow stronger. We began to understand each other on a deeper level, beyond mere words. We learned to read each other's body language, to anticipate each other's needs, and to express ourselves without words. As our relationship progressed, I began to immerse myself in Korean culture. I watched Korean dramas, listened to K-pop, and tried different Korean foods. I even took a crash course in Korean language and culture. And in turn, N began to learn about American culture, becoming fascinated with the nuances of English and the different foods and customs we shared. Our relationship wasn't always easy. We had our fair share of misunderstandings and cultural faux pas. There were moments of frustration and even tears, but we never gave up on each other. With time, we became a fluent couple. Our conversations became seamless, and we could understand each other without translation. The language barrier became a mere obstacle, something we could overcome with practice and patience. Today, N and I have been together for three years. We still learn from each other every day, embracing our differences and celebrating our uniqueness. We've traveled to Korea together and visited my family in America. We've broken down barriers and boundaries, creating a love beyond culture, beyond language, beyond all limitations. In conclusion, my relationship with N has taught me that love isn't limited by cultural divides. Love is a powerful force that transcends borders and boundaries, and through it, we can learn to appreciate and respect each other's differences. Although our journey was unconventional and not without challenges, I wouldn't have it any other way. N and I have discovered something precious and rare, something that has enriched our lives in ways we could have never imagined. As I reflect on our story, I'm reminded of the sound of the coffee machines in the shop, the smell of coffee beans roasting, and the way the sunlight peeked through the windows.
